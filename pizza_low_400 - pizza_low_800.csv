1,Negative,"I ordered a pizza at 4:49. Got an email that said my pizza would be delivered at 5:18 to5:28. 5:38 still no pizza. Called the store. They said it was out for delivery. I said I knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. Still no pizza. Called the store back. Again, I was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. When I was on the phone the pizza came. When it arrived it was COLD."
2,Negative,"The pizza wasn't very warm when it arrived (they didn't use the warming bag at time of delivery) and the order was wrong, but the pizza tasted good."
2,Negative,"Food was great! Loved the pepperoni rolls and the zamboni fries! Service was sub par. They hustled at first; however the server entirely forgot our pizza. When we inquired, she proceeded to blame it on the kitchen. She never apologized, nor did she offer a discount. She coerced us into paying our tab and did not offer to get us any additional food or beverage. Furthermore, she did not pass on to another server that we intended to stay and eat and drink-even though we explicitly stated that. We stayed for 45 minutes waiting to order more food and have our drinks refilled. Our plates were cleared and we were not offered additional food/drink. No one addressed us. L

Overall: good food, bad service."
1,Negative,If I could I could give 0 stars I would. So we show up around 5:30pm on a Monday. Place is pretty empty. Ordered drink which took about 30 mins to get. Ice was already melted in my drink. Ordered apps and meals. We did not get out food until 7:30. We waited a hour and a half for food @ a empty upscale pizza shop. BTW my pizza was cold. And there is some manager guy walking around looking busy but what a joke. Also I ordered a Calzone which was not a Calzone. Crust Chandler Simply Italian is a joke of a place and anyone that waste there money obviously does not care about the food they put in there mouth or any kind of service. What a rip off. Just remember every time someone has a bad experience they tell 10 people. I was with 4 people. That's 50 people in day. I think the major issue is the customer base has no clue what good Italian is. It sad that so many people accept this.
2,Negative,"The pizza was great, but the guys that make it , while we were there they were scratching their heads, taking  their hats off to run fingers through their hair. And one guy that was cutting up something was eating. They need to wash their hands after scratching. Will not be back to this one"
2,Negative,"If Giordano's is looking to compete with Lou Malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe. The crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza. Lou Malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while Giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries. C'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!

To someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, Giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite. 

Overall Giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either. They could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks.
 
If you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to Grimaldi's."
1,Negative,"Fix your store, it is so poorly run that I cannot even go there. There are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!

Our neighborhood is not this gross but if I was from outside the area, I would think it's the slums. Totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. No excuses.

It also has a foul odor to it...the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks...nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards"
2,Negative,"Went for the 1st.time to CPK on the advice of a friend, there were 8 in our party. We were seated at a table that was made for 6, kinda cramped for space,we endured because they said the wait for a bigger table would be 20 min. Although there were 2 areas  bigger than where we sat that were empty.  
         Now when your waitress finally shows for drinks (about 5 min) and the first words out of her mouth are.  ""They must think I'm  wonder woman, I already have a table of 7 and a table of 12"". Translated= hey guys, your service is gonna suck but that's not my fault. And it did!!!!
          My wife and I split the pepperoni, sasuage and mushroom pizza, obviously  'shrooms are the cheapest ingredient cause that's about all we could find. Pizza was bland, 'shrooms  overpowering and service sacked. If that's what your looking for in a dining experience, then this is the restaurant and location for you. If not  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Negative,"Horrible customer service. I have gotten food from here a few times expecting to have a better experience from the last, but I was wrong to hope for that. I once called and they answered ""Hold on"" and just put the phone down. After waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. I called back again and they answered ""Hold on"" again. I waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. I asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says ""Well what do you want to know specials on?"" In a kind of sarcastic tone. We've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. This has happened multiple times. When going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. Horrible customer service. The food here is WAY OVER PRICED. The pizza is mediocre. They may use ""fresh ingredients"" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. Maybe I would have thought the food was better if I received better service. 

If you want WAYYYY better NY pizza go to rockos pizza. Way better prices, extremely friendly service, way better EVERYTHING."
1,Negative,"This hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest.  The pepperoni is clustered around the center.  The sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it.  The crazy bread is tasty though."
2,Negative,"More like 2.5 stars. I'm giving two so the owners will have more incentive to make the necessary tweaks.

I really wanted to like Strada 241. It's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food was lackluster. We split a salumi plate and each had a pizza (I had the 'nduja). The salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats. The pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven).

I would come back to try the pastas and also to see if the pizza improves. There's no lack of effort here and the food is honest."
1,Negative,"Used to be a good place. Has gone downhill the last few years. I already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but I was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . 

I ordered to go and when I got their at 8 pm on a Saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, I had a feeling something wasn't right. 
Spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. One the was spaghetti with meat sauce, I would compare it to a can of Chef Boyardee. The other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. 

Threw them both in the trash

After this meal, I also threw my Streets of New York takeout menu in the trash"
1,Negative,One of THE worst pizzas I've ever had. The cooks are really cheap when it comes to cheese (the pizza was almost all tomato sauce) because the cheese was missing. Absolutely no taste. I don't usually bad reviews unless earned and these ppl working here certainly earned a bad review. Maybe the owner is a cheap person and is forcing cooks to be cheap with toppings.
1,Negative,"My review is based on my experience with the management, not the food. The food is just ok, nothing to write home about. Secret pizza at Cosmo is better.

The manager on duty failed to do his duties when I requested him to call security to come assist me when I was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. I felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager NEVER CALLED them. He in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. I spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call. 

SHAME ON YOU manager on duty Sunday 1:30AM for lying about calling security."
2,Negative,"Honestly? It tasted weird. I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. The sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what I expected. Now, Mineo's...better pizza."
1,Negative,"California Pizza Kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. 

Before I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK. 

Recently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. 

The pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. 

So we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience."
1,Negative,first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned
2,Negative,Second time in and again I wait for a Ready Now plain ole cheese pizza!   I need to learn to go to another store that may be ready to care for customers!
1,Negative,"Ordered delivery for me and the kids. Two hours later, our meal arrived. I called to inquire after about an hour. Was told that the delivery was on the way. Minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. Do you think it was on the house? Nope. Just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. Not good enough. 
Now, let's talk food. The meatball ""panini"" was a piece of French bread with a bland/acidic sauce. The meatballs were overcooked and dry. Not a pleasant experience. The pizza sauce was also watery and bland. You'd think that a place called ""Sauce"" would have figured it out by now. Not so."
1,Negative,"If I could give this 0 stars I would.
Delivery took an hour. Pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. Sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping.  Gross is the only word I can think of to describe this pizza. Save your money. You'll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at Giant Eagle."
2,Negative,"My order got here earlier than expected but the toppings, cheese and sauce is all over the box. Now the crust is soggy. I hate being that person but now I have to call for a new pizza."
1,Negative,"The service is slow and not very friendly and the pizza tastes store bought. I've tried to eat here several times with friends. 
But it just doesn't seem to do anything for me. 
There's a Jack in the Box across the parking lot with hot food and friendly service."
1,Negative,"This place SUCKS! The guy was very nice on the phone taking my order, but then 30 MIN later, I receive some call from Gary saying that they do not deliver to me. Thanks for letting me know when I placed my order and gave you my cc# already!!
I don't know how the pizza is yet, from other location, because it has yet to arrive. 
Waste of time"
1,Negative,"Horrible Food don't waste your money

This is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.

Loudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. 

I looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today."
2,Negative,"Ok for $5 - 6  but not good pizza, no  flavor,  good for young children or anyone else who likes bland pizza!  If they want to charge extra for thin crust they should put it in writing! I would rather give my $5.00 to Little Cesar's!"
2,Negative,"I used to like the pizza from here. Last time I ordered it was still doughy and I had to cook longer. Today it was ice cold. Not even lukewarm. My kid was screaming for pizza so I didn't send it back. But, I won't ever order from here again. $31 plus tip for a cold pizza and cold soup. There was a piece of ""garlic bred"". It was half a sub roll uncooked with some garlic butter on it. Yum. Should have had a can of Progresso and a frozen pizza and saved $25. Wait, I could have saved $35. I tipped $10. I figure a poor kid driving his own car deserves a decent tip. I called to let them know and she said sorry we can replace the pizza. My kid ate the cold thing anyway. And who wants to wait another hour for the replacement? Blah. Next time I'll drive my lazy self over to Bonnanos and pick up a pizza myself."
2,Negative,"I really enjoy the food, can't say the same about their service. I waited an hour and 20 minutes for two pizzas and when they finally arrived they were incredibly cold! Not a happy customer."
1,Negative,Absolutely avoid this place it's a last resort for me and even then I regret it. Undercooked pizza sparse toppings and the rudest employee ever. They need to just shut this place down I've given them so many second chances and will never do it again. When you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! I hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot.
2,Negative,"Waiter was over the top cheesy.  Talked too much.  A bit obnoxious.
No gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (Ferro's on St. Clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free).
One of the specials had risotto as a side so I asked if I could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no.  Treated me like I was asking them to make risotto from scratch.
So I ordered a steak instead which was good but if I wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place.
Marcello's is clearly stuck in the past....no variety for those with dietary restrictions."
1,Negative,"My wife and I visited East West Pizza because we purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate for $2 and we've been questing to find decent pizza in the area.

Our meal here was mediocre. We were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while I stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza.

I wasn't going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago I received a spam email from East West -- I must have filled out some comment card or something so, I emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list. They replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. 

For the next several months, despite this guarantee, I continued to receive spam in my email from East West. I emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. Tonight I emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming.

East West Pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that I never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers."
1,Negative,"My fiance ordered from here recently. After waiting almost 2 hours for our pizza to arrive, we called and asked what was going on, they said it would be there soon. Ten to fifteen minutes later it shows up and the driver informed us that they forgot to make the pizza. Any to top it all off we received some cardboard with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices on it. Wouldn't recommend"
2,Negative,"I'm just in the area for the day... Showing some houses to some buyer clients and needed a place to stop for lunch between appointments. I ate too much. This Brother's is not as good as a similar place on Peoria... But it was decent. I would eat here again if driving by and in the mood for pizza. My Pepsi tasted fine. The girl who took my order was happy & pleasant. I got my soda topped off before I left and I got two sides of ranch at no charge... The only thing I was out off by was that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the ranch because they were both half full which is why I needed two. If I had paid for them, I would have said something. I'm full, happy and ready for a nap... Oh! Need to show houses... 

I ordered the two slices of cheese and a Pepsi and my total was $4.38

Um I went to the bathroom before leaving,.. The door didn't lock and toilet sprayed water (yes toilet water) at me and did not flush properly... Hopefully they get that fixed!"
2,Negative,"2 stars

The pizza is ridiculously overpriced, $17 for an 11-inch pizza?

Our server was a little aggressive, he even complained about his other customers to us.  Who knew what he was saying about us?   He also must have thought we were stupid because he kept explaining the difference between sausage  and pepperoni?  REALLY?

The server really ruined this meal for us, he even tried some adult humor with the serving of the beer.  I'll leave it at that.  So the food never had a chance, we just wanted to leave.

If you eat here...take your time, the pizza comes out real fast.

Being from New Jersey, we know and appreciate good pizza...this was mediocre at best.

We won't be returning."
1,Negative,I called in for delivery and waited an hour for them to deliver my pizza which yes they might have been busy I understand but when they drop it off I didn't take a look at the pizza because I was working and put it in the back in the break room as soon as I went to go get a slice the entire pizza was burned and it looked old. I waited an hour at least you guys should have made sure my pizza was not burn and at least somewhat fresh. It's so mess up. They wouldn't even give my money back.
1,Negative,I do not recommend going to this location what so ever. Please drive a little out of your way and avoid this location. Absolutely nothing hot n ready. While waiting 20 minutes for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest one would think the pizzas would be hot but they were room temp with no pizza sauce and hardly any cheese. Please do not waste your money and time here. I grew up with little Caesars and have been to many in different states over the past 15 years and I have never had such a bad experience food wise I have never left a little Caesars Pizza and thought I was ripped off but this location had me felling like I was ripped off which I was and you will be too. Please go to any other location do not waste your time or money at this location.
2,Negative,"This place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  Pizza Nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one I've ever frequented.  The pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  Not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  You dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.  The lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.  It's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.  We didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.  If there was a better option in the area I wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't."
1,Negative,Really bad experience here. Went in at 6pm for a drink and asked about dueling pianos. They start @ 8pm. Ok. We had two drinks and were hungry. Asked if we could get pizza from across the way and bring in. Yes that was fine. Get your hand stamped so u can come back in. We got pizza (worst ever) and were then told we could not bring it in. Had to sit outside and they were closing the bar for half an hour while they set up. Ate and then got in line to go back in. No charge since we had our hand stamped. Tried to fit at a table and were told NO we had to stand. The tables were reserved!  Nowhere did it state that we needed a reservation nor did the bartender tell us that. Total bullshit way to treat customers who spent $50 on two drinks each!  EXTREMELY disappointed. Sucks
1,Negative,"Ordered from Caliente on a weeknight, and it took an hour and a half to get the pizza.  When we finally got the pizza it was cold.  I was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed.  The toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  

Bottom line - if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in two hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else."
1,Negative,"This is one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurants. We ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. After over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. He said he was too busy to help us. He said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. If we didn't want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. Who treats customers like that? I told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. She just shrugged her shoulders and said ""do what you have to"". I don't think I gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. The management is an embarrassment and service, all around was horrendous. What a disappointment."
2,Negative,This place had us pretty impatient the whole time! I shared a pizza with my significant other and he asked for half of it to have no onions but it came out covered in onions all over! It then took a half an hour to split the bill. To be honest i wasn't very impressed by the food.
2,Negative,"Called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  Once I placed my order I was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50....it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?  Why a twenty minute range for pickup?  I cancelled order so never got to taste the food.  Good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon.

FYI - your rating on Yelp is the same as Peter Piper Pizza.  Hilarious!"
2,Negative,"I don't know what people are talking about. Being from NJ I can tell you this is NOT good NY style pizza. It's the kind of pizza you get in NY and then never return to that place again. I tried the regular and the white pizza. The white pie had no flavor, no garlic no salt, nothing. The regular pie had hardly any sauce, and the crust was hard as a rock. I hope there are better places for ""NY style"" pizza in the area.  We left hungry. They also messed up our order so it took about twenty minutes to get four slices of pizza warmed up.

Also they weren't wearing gloves or anything. Maybe I'm a stickler but I don't like people touching my food with their hands and then touching everything else in the kitchen. Gross."
1,Negative,Haven't been to pizza hut in a few yrs. My daughter and I wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so I ordered online  (ok that wasn't successful so I had to call) anyway I placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust. This was at noon. Wasn't very happy. Needless to say I don't think I'll be attempting this again any time soon
1,Negative,"I wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues...

We were very excited to move into Sun Prairie where there was a Glass Nickel Pizza nearby (we previously lived in the Milwaukee area).  The day after we moved in, we decided to order Glass Nickel to eat while unpacking.  The staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  Pizza itself was okay, but not NEARLY as good as the New Berlin and West Madison locations.

The next day, we became violently ill.  With the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing I ate all day so I'm sure that it was from this.  My husband and I are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  We do not plan on re-visiting the Sun Prairie Glass Nickel Pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  Such a shame!!"
1,Negative,"Still yucky.  picked up an order which should have been hot, hard as a rock like cardboard and burnt on the bottom.  There are many other places in town for good pizza avoid this and you will be more than happy.  Hit and Miss place, mostly Miss"
1,Negative,Pizza came out cold. We ordered the classic pepperoni and there were probably three slices of pepperoni in the entire pizza. It was just all sauce and cheese.
1,Negative,"Did the online order. Arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after I'm told it will be a little longer, I'm told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  WTF?!?  So now I'm sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  I wouldn't have ordered if I knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings. Nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you've already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question I have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when I get home. I want a nice fresh, hot pizza. Not something that's been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!!"
1,Negative,"The best thing about our visit was our waitress. She was attentive and apologetic that the pizza was terrible. It was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. Too bad. It was the first time we have been out in the evening in 4 months.What a disappointment!  We won't be returning."
1,Negative,"We ""used"" to order the family special every week or two on a regular basis. Food was decent & value for the $ (at that time) was fairly good too. One night we ordered, the food was delivered. We paid cash & tipped well (always do, as I used to deliver fast food myself). We get a telephone call the next day saying that we shorted the driver $10. WTF? Seriously? Like the driver would NOT know this right at the door (if it were true)? We do NOT get a call that night (we ordered for dinnertime) but the next day! Clearly they got ripped off by their driver. We have NOT ever ordered from there again. Brampton's best pizza(s)..Mackay & Gusto's."
1,Negative,"I was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  I should have saved my money. Person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.

Bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. We could tell when we opened the box.  The crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  On one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. The other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  

Whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  I would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  Sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  That hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.

It such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  Do I call and complain? Do I have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 PM? 

We also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  Good meat and tangy sauce.

Finally, I was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  I ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.

I really wanted to like this place, especially because I like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. We won't be going back."
1,Negative,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Let me say first that we didn't get the deep dish, I didn't realize that is what they were famous for. Also the staff were nice, not overly helpful but never rude. My daughter got their wings, super fatty (probably Tyson). There was a long blonde hair in it, she has dark brown hair. When we told our waiter he said OK then took the plate, no apology. They did bring her out new ones but like I said before they were to fatty to enjoy. They did not even offer to take them off our bill. Our thin crust pizza taste like it literally came from a box. I can't even remember the last time I have had thin pizza this BAD!! The ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and I believe it was covered in the store bought Hershey's syrup. I have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. Nothing has ever been that disappointing that I felt the need to write one until now."
1,Negative,"These people are below average intelligence 
Try to rip you off 
Argue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store!
Had enough of them I do not have the time to teach basic common sense !
The special reads add any pizza for 9.95
(Equal or lesser value )
I order a pepperoni and sausage and a specialty pizza.
Simple right well they say they can't honor the ""2nd"" pizza because it's a ""specialty""
What does it matter what order I say my pizza's in?
Is it the darn important that you have to say the specialty pizza 1st? Common sense would be to just charge for the specialty pizza the charge me for the pepperoni and sausage at 9.95 right?
Well if I have to teach them basic common sense and argue over it I will just find me a new shop!"
1,Negative,"Very mediocre pizza. If you're stranded in the Brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you're really hungry, you'd be better off walking to the Circle K and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives. To everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little...and eat better pizza."
2,Negative,"Normally we love Papa John's, but they don't deliver to our place.  We really wanted pizza so ordered carryout from what we thought was the Middleton store.  Our mistake we ordered from here.  That's ok.  It was our mistake.

However, this store is insanely hard to find and get to and there is zero parking outside for carryout.  We ordered online from another store and the order stated it would be ready in 45 minutes.  It gave us a time.  It actually took longer than 45 minutes to weave through the square and finally park illegally in an alley behind the store while the husband went to get said pizzas.  They were just putting them in the oven.  So we had to wait another twenty minutes and staff wasn't apologetic, just rude stating that the pick up time is an estimate.

The pizza was fine.  It was fresh and stayed warm on an eighty degree day until we were home to eat it.  But....it's not worth the trip and while I gave no real issues with it taking an hour plus to be ready for carryout during a busy time of day  that should be acknowledged ahead of time."
1,Negative,The most disgusting pizza I have ever eaten.  Nothing but salt and no cheese.  Ugh...will never order from them again!
2,Negative,"Pretty average spot. 

Italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you. I had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. They've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. 

Service was adequate. 

Is Baldwin street actually good?"
1,Negative,"We ordered this Monday night after a busy work day. Generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. Not this time. I got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. Im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. I phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. I explained how I didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. They proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. I honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. I am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. Violently awful and lasted for days now. Please beware..."
1,Negative,"I was so excited for my sons 2nd bday party. It was aweful!! The host was everything but a host. A guest passed out cake and my husband stood at the door to hand out goodie bags. My party was from 4-6 and at 5:30 she started cleaning around people making it very awkward and guests left early. She was wearing a lower cut dress and I now have her cleavage in the pictures of my son blowing out his candles. 
When I booked the party I was told that each child gets 2 pieces of pizza, they actually get 1 slice cut in half. I had 15 children and 2 babies, I was charged extra for the babies even though they never left their mothers arms. She wasnt a kid friendly person and would just hollar out that it was time for cake or pizza, getting nobodys attention I was forced to round up the kids and get them seated. She started a ""soda tab"" and they charge $1 for a can of soda. At the end of the party I had spent $100 more than planned on sodas, extra pizza and the ridiculous 18% gratuity that was added on to my bill. A $45 tip was not what I had in mind for her. When calling the owner to discuss my issue she did NOTHING to resolve it and might have well just called me a liar because she defended the host to the very end. I will not recommend TOY TOWN to anyone!! BAD BUSINESS!!!!"
1,Negative,"Ordered 5 pizzas at 11 for 11:45 pickup confirmed waiting for 25 minutes and pizza still not ready. 
Got an ""oh sorry"".  

I watched 5 customers leave.  One said, "" let's go for office max we stand a better chance of getting food."""
2,Negative,We went for dinner and it was alright. The bruschetta was the best part of the meal! The pizza was soggy and the quinoa salad was alright.
1,Negative,"Every once in a while I love to remind myself as to why I don't order delivery from chain pizza places like Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc. sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised and tonight I was not. 

Over an hour and a half delivery time and I received a soggy medium pan pizza. But what had me most concerned is that my pizza was pulled out of the oven and checked at 6:35ish and was sitting there for over 45 min before it left the store. 

After delivery fees and tips for $16 I recommend eating a frozen pizza because at least you can pull it out when it's actually done baking. Me, didn't have access to an oven. Otherwise I know what I would've done. Baked a pizza."
2,Negative,"Do yourself a favor: Order Carry Out, not delivery. I order here like twice a month, but about 1/3 of the time I order delivery they attempt to deliver my pizza to the wrong apartment. 

Not sure why their drivers can't plug my address into Google Maps and figure out where I am. The staff at this location have proven to be incredibly incompetent and I am sick of giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances."
2,Negative,"Wow I have been here four or five times. The first couple were a few months ago and I thought the pizza and pasta was great! I'm from Chicago and appreciated having this nearby. Well I'm not sure what happened but the past three times in the last two months are unacceptable. Just bad. First visit -- watery spaghetti and meatballs. It was marginally ok ... I ate it. The garlic bread was ... Terrible, I could have made better with wonder bread and garlic salt which is basically what it was ... Second time, I waited in line and their computer system went down it was a Friday night and they had no clue what to do... I forgave them for this, it happens but they could have written down my order and made my pizza ... They were completing orders and had other customers they just decided to freak out and not take mine, how did people order pizza and pay before computers? I had cash too. Third time tonight is just unacceptable. I don't eat a lot of pizza or carbs, when k to it's a treat ... I just spent $35 for a take and bake pizza (it was not cooked) and eggplant Parmesan (which was surprisingly ok) but the garlic bread was also not cooked. When I say this stuff was not cooked I mean it was not cooked. I had to break out my toaster oven which I did not appreciate. Terrible. I guess I have to find a new place or stick with due forni even though they are not really a take out place, huge disappointment I was hungry... 3 strikes you are out."
1,Negative,"The pizza was burn over cooked. We eat three slices and make up no taste to it. Would not recommend this place for their pizza. At the end we asked for a box, the staff make us a small container for more than a half of a pizza. Not even a pizza box ."
1,Negative,"We found this place several years ago and had some family with us. We ordered pizza, salad and garlic knots. Everything was so delicious. We visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. Last night proved it will be the last time. A 16' pizza is now $20 or more. All the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. They only have one size pizza. We ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. We asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. We have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time.  Ordered 6 wings $6.50 for 6 wings
 They were very good. We asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. We got charged .60c for a souffle cup. Nope that was it. So very dissatisfied overall. Service was mediocre. Guess all customers will have to pay for the minimum wage hike, tipping no longer needed."
1,Negative,"When I got home to eat my pizza it barely had any cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni. Next time I'll pay the extra fee for more toppings, if I ever from here again."
1,Negative,"The last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food. We decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour. THREE HOURS later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, ""we got busy, we can't help it"". I can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! And we're less than 5 miles down Durango from them. The food is decent, but we won't be ordering from them again. Don't waste your time."
1,Negative,The staff was super nice and delivery was quick. However for three large pizzas it was over $72. The pizzas were plain with no flavor. Looked beautiful but zero spice
2,Negative,"After hearing so many people in the area raving about Folco's I finally decided to try it out. And we were looking for a reception spot for a Baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  I was disappointed about the food. The veal parmigiana was sub-par. Too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. My husband tried a pasta dish which was ""ok"" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. The drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste I was hoping to get out of it. The caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. Their tomato sauce - homemade I was told - tastes like something out of a jar. I was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the Italian restaurant across the street. I was hoping to go back & try out their pizzas, but there is a much better Italian restaurant in the Garden Basket Plaza that makes everything from scratch and I have been a regular of theirs since they opened."
1,Negative,"If I had to rate this place on pizza alone, this review would be a lot different.

First of all, I have had a $5 off an order of $20 or more coupon for.. well, I can't even tell you how long. Every time I call to place an order, they give me some new bs excuse as to why I can't use my coupon. (""Oh, we already ran your card"" which, well, why the fuccccccc would you do that? And I'm sure if I wanted to add something to my order, that would be justtttt fine. Or ""Well, the you can't use that with the family deal,"" in which case, why the heck isn't that written on the coupon? That's really something that should be in the fine print.)

Then tonight, my family in from out of state decides on pizza and wings... and regardless of the stupidity of their employees (""Well, the family deal DOES come with two two liters,"" ""UH, no it doesn't... it comes with one..."" ""WELLL I am looking at it right here and it says TWO liters."" REALLY? YES. ONE BOTTLE IS TWO LITERS. DERRRRRRP.) their pizza happens to be some of my fave. So we order pizza and wings, and we ask for medium wings with EXTRA wing hot sauce on the side. Instead, we get a vat of ranch and wings that are dryer than Betty White's.... well, yanno."
2,Negative,"The pizza is good, a little limited in variety, but that is the traditional thing, I guess. Does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out."
1,Negative,"Poor service. Terrible food. Soggy and undercooked, no understanding of the problem. 
Took 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza. Had our money refunded the food was so terrible."
1,Negative,"Visited this place on November 19th 2016, which is National Adoption Day, and the service was horrible. The cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly. We had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate. As we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn't have to move just yet. At that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven't even received our food at the time. The food came out sporadically as we'd get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last. This place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business."
1,Negative,absolute garbage. 0 stars. flies crawling all over the slices. smells gross. pizza barely had any tomato sauce. pepperonis were like the ones from a lunchable. cheese is plastic crap. I'm royally PISSED off & papa ceo would be too!!!!!! gross!
1,Negative,"We ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. Called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  Delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  Horrible customer service.  If the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  Better yet, NEVER order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!"
1,Negative,Ok so they charge a lot just for a single slice of pizza but what gets me is they charge a lot for what looks like old pizza that they reheat just to give to you which is one messed up and two gross I recommend going to Paris casino and go to La pizza same price but man is it worth it the pizza at that place was amazing definitely worth the walk and and use your money for better food!
1,Negative,"What went wrong is the service. We called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away. An hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person. So it's either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves. We were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted. This is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later...."
1,Negative,Great childhood memories but absolutely horrible pizza & customer service Tuesday night! If I could leave NO stars I would. Both our pies had no cheese or at least not enough to be considered pizza. When we called to complain the young man did NOT want to hear it & firmly stated all ingredients are weighed out period. Left my name & # for the manager/owner to call me (because he was too busy) and still have received nothing. I WILL NEVER GO BACK
2,Negative,"I just don't get it.  Why is this a local favorite?  The pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  I also ordered the Chicken Parmesan with linguine.  The chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.  They don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.  I'd eat at Carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.  The search for good pizza in Phoenix continues."
1,Negative,"Reading previous posts, obviously people who like this place have never been to any decent pub whatsoever.... With that being said this place is never busy, especially during the day, and for decor wise it looks like a hospital with the wall paper ... Food is mediocre but always frozen ya I can tell.... With that being said its no wonder why there is never anyone in there personally is rather have shitty service at Madison's or Boston pizza or actually the black bull pub but atleast the food is fresh and 9c wings at the black bull"
1,Negative,The service was super slow. They had MAYBE 5 people inside and another 15 outside and we had to wait close to an hour for our pizza we NEVER got. Wouldn't suggest if you're hungry.
1,Negative,I love Pizza 73s pizza. But this place uses the same spatula to spread the sauces on the pizza. Many times when ordering a creamy garlic based sauce because I have a tomato allergy. I have found tomato sauce mixed in with the creamy garlic. Not impressed
2,Negative,"This was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. 

We came in around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. My wife and I decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. As we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. She then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? So we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish.

Over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving. After a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! I was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! Not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. We ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. We both did not want any more! When our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. We may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!"
1,Negative,This was the worst pizza I have ever had. The cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. The crust was bland and hard. The price was right at $3.99 so I gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat.
1,Negative,Ordered the pizza on my phone. It said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Went to pick it up. Worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet. Didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! Brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! I'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system? I don't know. But either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. I've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.
1,Negative,"After waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents I now know I should have kept waiting.   I expected a bit of a line but I was rushed through checking and They were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  Luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.   

We ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes.  And ordered a child's pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes. He got a thin crust. 

Our deep dishes didn't come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the KIDS menu pizza and the thin crust. We were there over 3 hours.  OH and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it.  Instead covered in olives which he hates.   

I regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much I love this place. The servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door.  Save yourself the trouble of relying on their service. Just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from Chicago as this place doesn't deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set. 

""We swear 10 more minutes max and it's out"" waited another 20. 

This place doesn't deserve to wear the name."
1,Negative,I waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than I do... I ain't that mad but I just don't like getting diabetes. The customer service was good nothing bad to say .. but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds.
1,Negative,"We were honestly disappointed. When you go to a pizza place you expect at a minimum soda?? You can't drink beer there bc they have no liquor license so if you want a beer, you have to go next door and then they bring you your pizza.. and if you want something besides tap water with no ice, you get a choice of 3 seltzer waters..: with no ice. Seriously SO weird. I ended up going next door to the coffee shop just to get a coke. The pizza was okay, the service was terrible.. nobody came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, give us menus etc. for just opening up... we were disappointed."
2,Negative,One of the worst pizza I had . They did not even bother to make the pizza correct for me. Overpriced . I would prefer blaze Anyday.
1,Negative,Wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought ...WTH sbarro?  Now mediocre isn't even bad enough u have to go sub par with it... Smh
1,Negative,Wife and I both got sick over their pizza.  It didn't taste right.  I did like the peppers they use.  But that's the only nice thing I have to say.
1,Negative,The pizza was not that remarkable.it came barely warm. One person in our party ordered a chicken wrap and as the rest of us finished our pizza the wrap still had not been served. We eventually cancelled it . The staff was apologetic .
2,Negative,"new italian restaurant. they make their own sauce and pasta ""everyday"" according to the waitress who served us. food was okay. garlic bread sold as ""charity bread"" was very tasty....apparently net proceeds are donated to some charity. 

because it is new....staff are inexperienced. they brought out a water bottle which they couldn't open...served us a pizza called ""americano"" instead of coffee americano (not sure why they thought we'd order 4 main dish for 3 people)...and when the coffee came, they forgot about cream which we had to ask for...by the time we got the cream...coffee was cold. still charged us full price, whopping 4 bucks for a very small amount of coffee...4oz maybe less. 

we were entertained for a while by the mishaps, but found the overall experience underwhelming. decent ambiance, louder music than I'd like, service can be significantly improved."
1,Negative,"My daughter ordered a large pizza and 8 wings online. The delivery came and it turned out to be a small pizza and 16 wings. When I called the store and asked them to review the order #, they read the order we received. I explained that's not what my daughter ordered, to which they replied, she must've hit the wrong buttons and proceeded to hang up. IF I wanted to order another pizza, don't you think that would be a perfect opportunity to rectify the problem???  Nope!!!  When my wife called back, Casey the manager was extremely rude and offered nothing but a customer service phone number. We will never order from Papa John's again... no matter where the location."
1,Negative,Ordered a pizza a few weeks ago & have to say it was horrible. It seemed almost raw. The crust was cooked but the cheese was white not the golden color on a good pizza. It's a shame because it's so close to home. We've had food from there before but it's been awhile & it use to be good. I guess I'll be sticking with Rocco's because they are always consistently good.
1,Negative,"Um Caliente SERIOUSLY!?!

So after work I decided to order a pizza a pie. Nothing too crazy. A Red Pizza by my definition is a pizza with red sauce on it. Apparently, not this time. Anywho I ordered a Red Pizza with Parmesan on the side and garlic sauce.

I received: Cheese with extra red sauce. No Parmesan, and some weird sauce with green stuff in it maybe it cilantro/basil I don't know. Plus it was undercooked! Thats kind of a trifecta of badness by my definition. I dont know. I would like to say this was the first time I've received an undercooked pizza which I had to send back but alas it is my third.

Caliente, whats going on?!?! I'm confused, bewildered, baffled even. Step your game up or else Giovanni's is more than welcome to take my money anyday."
1,Negative,"Customer service here is terrible. I ordered a pizza on my way home from a 40 min drive, realizing I forgot my purse at work when I went to pick it up. No offer to look up my card number or anything so who knows what happened with the food - hopefully it did not go to waste. After about an hour and a half when I was on my way home again at 9:40, 20 min away, I called again to order, the person on the phone kept hitting buttons and telling me the disruption was on my end and in between the loud beeps, asked me if I could be there by 10 because they close their doors at 10. Needless to say, I said forget it and placed my second order at one of the MANY nearby stores that keep their doors open way past 10 pm on a Friday night. And when I drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the employees were standing around talking in the parking lot. Must have had important things to do. Won't be ordering from them again."
2,Negative,"Over priced and under delivers!
- A 12 inch pizza was likely only 10 inch.
- It barely fed the two of us.
- Tasted okay (definitely nothing to brag about)
- At $25, this was definitely not worth the price!
- Won't be ordering from there again."
1,Negative,"Ordered a Hawaiian pizza, got half Hawaiian,Half Cheese, and half burnt.
They vaguely describe that their ""sandwiches"" are Calzones. They're kind of good."
1,Negative,The wings are not like they used to be seems like frozen cheap wings from Walmart and the prices went way up thx to new law of 10hr I've been ordering from here now for 5 years but I want be no more not worth the extra money the pizza was ok but not great like in the past
2,Negative,"Giordano's is a well known Chicago Restaurant that's famous for their Chicago Style Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza. They also offer Hand Stretched Thin Crust Pizza and Crispy Extra Thin Pizza. On the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more.

On Yelp I read about the long wait times so I planned to try them when they opened. At that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. We were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare. 

We shared an entree sized Harvest Salad. The salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. This salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it.

During our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. I found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality.

Just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering.

I received my individual stuffed plain pizza. The pizza wasn't sliced all the way through and I found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. Kinda like a rock. The crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. The very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. Although I found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that I found inedible. I don't know if the crust I received is typical of Giordano's or not. 

My husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. He said that he was glad that he wasn't hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. He did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the ""Other"" Chicago place uses.

I really liked the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the well trained servers I encountered.

I would never go back for the pizza I received."
2,Negative,"I'm sad to write this review, because I'm actually obsessed with Caliente's Hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad I feel that I can no longer give them my business! Every time I order I get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time I call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes.... and every time it is late. Last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair. But, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? If that was the only time this sort of thing happened, I would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time I went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well. Maybe it's a training problem... a hiring problem?

Pros:
+Pizza is GOOD

Cons:
-Slow inattentive service
-Slow delivery
-general lack of concern about the happiness of their patrons"
1,Negative,I just moved to the area and I have ordered from this location twice... Both times our hand tossed pizza showed up as a thin crust! I have ordered this same pizza at our other location several times and the thickness was perfect! Our pizza was so thin that it could not even stay together on the ride over. Guess I'll try the local Papa Johns.
1,Negative,TERRIBLE! This was unfortunately the we worst pizza I have had in a long time! I am staying at the wonderful Andaz Resort across the street. I thought I would get a quick pizza and bring it back to the room. I am so disappointed. We are ordering from one of the large chains so we can fix our pizza craving now.  Sad...small...thin...pitiful pizza. You will notice that I never leave bad reviews but this time I have to. Yuck!!!!! I wasted $18 plus a $2 tip!
2,Negative,"Just ordered and holy smokes I've never seen the delivery time like this one, 65 to 75 minutes. wow they need to step their game because this is becoming not worth the wait at all not to mention it's a hit or miss if the pizzas cooked good or not disappointed"
1,Negative,"This will be my last time here. Pizza is full of a ton of grease. The guys who make the pizza use their bare hands, then toggle back and forth to the cash register. Last night my pizza was just a puddle of grease, its not even edible. Their prices are outrageously expensive for the quality. Its the closest to my house but i think the pizza at the 7-11 is better quality now. This place has really gone down the tubes. Its just not what it used to be. A friend told me the one on S. Buffalo is the real Roccos to go. Something about a bad break up between then two guys. I also spent 18 bux on a veal parm sub. Seems a little pricey for the sub. It was good but not 18 dollar worth good. Their pizza is just a greasefest. It must just be really low end cheese to create that. My recommendation would be to go to Bambinos or East side for quality pizza. If you want really low end stuff that is over priced, come here and get some pizza that just sits out all day."
2,Negative,"It surprises me what celebrity chefs are willing to put their name on. Riva is a poolside (all outdoor) restaurant at The Venetian. We went here for lunch and I was completely underwhelmed by the choices on the menu and by the food itself. Really? This is what a celebrity chef comes up with? Sad.

Very few choices so you better want a pizza, a club sandwich, or a standard salad. That's it. My daughter had the cheese pizza. I had the club sandwich, which came with fries. And I got a strawberry colada swirl. $60 later, we called that a lunch and left. I could have gotten that anywhere. Why on earth would that be what Wolfgang Puck offered up? Seems crazy to me.

If you want to overspend on something you can get better at your local diner...come here."
2,Negative,"I wanna like this place more. Fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza. But the delivery times are sooo bad. Worst I've ever experienced anywhere. They are always and forever late. And for the life of me, I can't understand why they can't keep up. Every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour. I've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! How is the bad delivery the only thing consistent?? Fix it!"
2,Negative,"I had such an awful experience. I've never been here before or had their food. I ordered through the phone for pick up. I was rushed to get my order in and the lady tried to hang up on me before I could even ask for the total amount (since I don't know the total with tax). 

I went by to pick the order, was greeted fine. I tell this balding older man I'm here for a pick up. He asks, ""The two pizzas?"" I said yes with a salad. He then cuts me off mid sentence to say, ""yeah yeah whatever."" He goes to the back to get the salad so I look through the menu one more time and he comes back to tell me, ""move where I can see you."" 

I will never come here again. This serve was down right awful and what made it worse, I was with my 6yr old brother and he had to sit through and listen to this. The pizza is not even that good!"
2,Negative,"Quick review:  Food:  delicious.  Service:  Poor.  SLOW.  

Five of us tried Lucille today for lunch.  We were seated quickly and served our drinks relatively quickly.  But, we waited well over an hour and a half for our food.  Lunch should not take nearly two hours.  Patrons will not go here for lunch if they think it will take more than an hour.  

Our wait staff seemed inexperienced.  PLEASE train the staff before you open.

Our party had both the Detroit panned pizza and the Neapolitan wood-fired pizza, the lunch pizza.  We all enjoyed the salad that comes with the lunch.   Not quite to the standards of Pizza Brutta, but very good.   Pizza and a very good salad for $10 is a great value.  

I know the place is new and I will try again.   But, service needs major improvement.  I really want to like this place."
2,Negative,"We had a menu shoved under our door. So we only thought to look at it. Wished we had looked at Yelp first. 
1) ordered the special: 2x 1 topping pizzas. We ordered pepperoni and pepperoni. We received one sausage and one pepperoni. 
2) we ordered cheese bread: it was ok. Nothing amazing, a more flat pizza crust than pudgier bread sticks. 
3). We ordered fried mushrooms. These were pretty good. We received 11 in the order. 
4) we were not eligible for the free soda because we had ordered a special (which sucks. 
5) we ordered a 2 L of Diet Coke and a 6 pack. Saying ""Diet Coke"" each time. 
I even told the story about how this is a Pepsi town and we needed our Diet Coke. 
What arrived?  Off brand diet cola. 
...
We picked this place bc of the Diet Coke written on the menu and the implicit guarantee of the guy taking the order. 

Side note:  the menu says ""under new management"". 

I feel I can say this sucks under new management. 

Review of the pizza:  it was 2 pizzas for 21$. It tasted like a 10$ pizza. So I'm ok w it. 

...Just to prove I'm not crazy I'm going to post a pick of the words Diet Coke...

So:  1 star for getting it here in 30 min (guy said 30-45 min, and it was a dinnertime delivery on the Strip) and 1 star bc the food taste met the price."
1,Negative,"Ordered for delivery and was told to expect a 40 minute wait, after an hour and a half our cold pizza's arrived. 
 The meat lovers pizza contained tasteless greasy Italian sausage, soggy pepperoni, and cold crusty ham slices in extremely sparing amounts.
 The grilled steak chipotle pizza came completely without sauce. Nothing better than a cold dry pizza.
 Would not recommend to my worst enemies."
1,Negative,Worst customer service ever ! Driver first got our order wrong three times and had to keep returning to switch out our pizza then our mozzarella sticks then we got the wrong 2 liter. Driver then offers a meal on her for all the inconvenience and doesn't fall thru with her offering. Every time we order from them our order is always wrong. I'd rather go to dominos !
2,Negative,"Avoid this place! I ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20! Ridiculous. No one that was making the pizza mentioned that each topping was extra. I started off with a $7.99 pizza! How in the world did those little toppings add $12.00! Workers are all incompetent. I was shocked when I received my total. I told the cashier that ALL the other make your own pizza places don't charge extra for toppings. The cashier's response was uhhhhh I just moved here from out of state. He looked like a deer in the headlights. I told him I'm never coming back. No offer to keep a first timer happy or even get a manager after it was obvious that this was a deal breaker for me.

To be fair the pizza was good and the decor is very well done inside. Go to MOD or Pieology instead."
1,Negative,"One of the very worst Pizza Hut's I have ever dealt with. They messed up my order, promised me a $15 credit in return, and then Rob and Tatiana refused to honor the credit. Their customer service skills were laughable. Rather than giving me a free cheese pizza, Rob spent 15 minutes on the phone interrogating me. And Tatiana seems to have never had a customer service job prior to this in her entire life. I ended up going to Domino's Pizza, where I got much better service for the same price."
1,Negative,"I've forgiven their rudeness over the phone many times, basically because I am able to order online. Tonight my son forgot to order one of our pizzas online and they gave him SO much grief about adding to the order that I finally took the phone. Asked the guy if we could add to the order, or at least have 2 online orders delivered at the same time. I get on the phone and this jack wagon says ""It's not MAGIC, ma'am!"" Ummm not asking for magic. He hung up on me. Solid business skills. Cancelled my order and got Dominos. Learn some people skills, you idiots"
1,Negative,"A large pizza with Sausage (more like pepperoni), mushroom and green peppers for 30$????  Are you kidding me?"
1,Negative,Nasty! I was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews.  Just went to NYC in Oct so wanted to compare.  Sorry not NY style pizza.
2,Negative,"Moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. Tried this place out. Family owned, which I like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. The single large pizza I ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and I took it home. It was plenty hot when I returned home, and that's great. The problem is.. it wasn't very good. The sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. I'd put it on par with Papa John's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment."
1,Negative,"First visit to this location and am extremely disappointed.  Sad to know who served me is now getting 10/hr. I know someone could provide a way better customer experience than this person did for the same amount of money.  If I was a business owner I'd be firing a crew like this as I'd lose out on business.  

First of all I arrived to find a hand drawn note on the door stating sorry we will open at 11, when they should have opened at 10:30a. 

Second they opened after 11 and the guy had no customer service once he unlocked the door.  Once i  entered nothing was said to me I simply stood near the register waiting to be acknowledged.  The guy decided to continue working behind the registers while his coworker stood around and snacked on something before I eventually was acknowledged.  

Thirdly, once I was acknowledged the guy asked what he could get for me.  I said I would like 3 hot and readys please.  He said my total  and then walked away before I could pay .  I continued to wait while he left me at the registers and went in the back area.  

Fourthly,  I waited over 10 minutes watching him stack up multiple pizza boxes with pizzas,   put stickers on pizza boxes,  placed finished pizzas in the warmers,  watched his Co worker  had off a pizza to someone who just drove up to the drive through all while I still stood there waiting.  

Fifthly, a third co worker eventually arrived and I asked her why that person received their order before me?
She went to the back and words were said between her and the coworkers and she just disappears.  

Finally the guy brings me my order stands at the register and just stares at me... I ask him  Oh are you ready for me to pay now??  He says yes and the total.  

If I didn't have  a hard working team I wanted to appreciate I would have just left.  I chose to go through this experience to the end and now here I am. . I hope the owners read this and take discipline on those employees.  If you don't believe me.  Check your cameras."
1,Negative,"This pizzeria place is terrible. The service was rude and they refused to let us eat our food at the table due to ""health code rules"". We were told that we could eat outside! We were able to order drinks but were told rudely several times that we could not have our pizza until we left the premises. Very unacceptable IMHO"
2,Negative,"I guess if you are truly desperate than this will serve a purpose. Just don't keep your expectations high.

We had guests in town and they were gambling it up in the D and didn't want to leave. We just wanted to sneak away and slam dunk something quick so we weren't hungry. So, in that sense, it served its purpose.

We got the 5.99 ""special"" of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza was obviously microwaved and very much like ""Michaelina"" type ""pizza"" you would buy in a grocery store. I mean..I held it down, but it was nothing special. The drink was pretty pitiful too...probably around the 12- 16 oz variety.

Plus, how can you serve food and NOT have a public restroom? Isn't that a violation of some sort??? Seriously?

If you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into...

2 stars."
2,Negative,Ordered two pizzas Sunday about 1:20.  They told my wife it would be 45 min. After almost 2 hrs. the pizza showed up. We had called about 2:30 and asked where our pizza was. They told us it was in it's way and they would credit the money back to our card. Pizza was cold and kids were starving. Not calling them again.
1,Negative,"We tried to call ahead to order a pizza.  No answer after several attempts and we thought this may be because of Monday Night Football.  My husband goes to pick up knowing he'll have to wait because they never ever have ""hot and ready"" any time of any day.  He places the order and the employee rings up the wrong thing.  My husband corrects him, and 3 or 4 orders are placed after my husband's order.  My husband watches the employee put the other orders in the oven.  He then comes over to my husband and again asks what it is he wanted.  My husband repeats the order.

After waiting and not paying close attention (mistake on his part, but then again...) the employee asks again what we wanted as he hands the box to my husband.  He of course comes home with the wrong product.  We had ordered the 5 meat pizza that is $9 in the TV commercials and received stuffed crust pepperoni.

We tried to call back and of course no answer.  This did not surprise us as we encountered this before going to the shop, and they did not even attempt to answer the phone while my husband was in the shop.  I shot off a message to the company while my husband made a return trip to try to rectify the situation.  I was told to take my comment to Customer Support.  I tried and the site froze on the 3rd page.  So, the whole company more or less ""backed up"" the bad service received at the shop.

Upon return, the employee got sarcastic with my husband insisting the product received was correct even after seeing the evidence that it was NOT.  We were able to keep the mistake but only received a $5 pizza as more or less an apology when we had ordered a higher-priced product.  

In the end we received 2 incorrect products.  The first had to be reheated.  It was mediocre at best when eaten but now has me ill with heartburn and stomach cramps.  I guess it's safe to say BOTH the pizza AND the customer service have left very bad tastes in my mouth."
1,Negative,"I don't see the point. It is a mess and ugly which fair enough is not news to anyone but now prices are high and not competitive. The same pizza is cheaper at no Frills, Shoppers and Lango's! And of course everything is strewn around in ugly fashion forget it"
2,Negative,"The service was fast. Great pizza. However, as someone with a shellfish allergy, I find it frustrating that this is yet another restaurant where cross-contamination is apparently an issue to the point where everything is grilled together, fried together, and so on."
1,Negative,"Worst service. Overcharged - and lied to over and over again while the delivery guy tried to think of a reason to stick. There is no reason a medium pizza that's 14.99 on your website should come to $25 before tip - especially when that's not what I was quoted on the phone. 

My own fault for ordering from dominos in a moment of apartment packing craziness."
2,Negative,"Hey Sauce! 
I heard some friends talking about how great your pizza was so I took the wife out to your restaurant last night to give it a try. I thought I'd provide you with our feedback as I have a feeling many other people may be feeling the same way we did about our experience. Lets start off with the good, the pizza was really good, our server was really good, the price of the food was decent, but that's kind of where it ends. Our first real impression of the place was when we were handed our menu's, both our menu's were beyond greasy and dirty and had food stuck to them, they were dingy/had bent corners and some of the paper had ripped off both of the menus this is a sign that nobody cares to wipe down the menus, and if nobody cares to even wipe down the menus it makes me wonder what else do they not wipe down regularly. When sitting around and taking in the whole atmosphere of the place, we felt it was a little dark and the restaurant as a whole needed to be wiped down. The garlic knots were really good, I still have mixed feelings about them, because most places that sell garlic knots dust them in parmesan cheese powder and some sort of garlic powder, and that's what I was kind of expecting here, but here I got fresh parmesan cheese and fresh chunks of garlic on top, don't get me wrong fresh is great but it was an ongoing battle to keep the garlic chucks and parmesan on top of the knot while eating it, where as if it were the parmesan powder I feel it would have stuck better and not have been so much work. The sauce that came with the garlic knots was amazing. Normally I like my garlic knots dipped in ranch, but I definitely liked your sauce over ranch last night. As far as your pizza goes it's really good. Let me start by saying I haven't found a place in the Vegas area that does pizza like yours, the thickness of the dough etc. We are transplants from California a little over a year ago and we've been on the hunt for a pizza with a crust like that. That's how 90% of all pizza places are in Southern California do it so that's what we've grown to like. Everything we have tried out here has seemed to try to spin off of New York thin style crust, so thank you for being a breath of fresh air for that. The pizza was hot when it came out as it should have, but for the life of me every slice I ate all the toppings would slide right off the crust, i felt like i might as well be eating a pizza casserole lol I thought that maybe everything was just too hot, but from the time I ate my first slice to the time I ate the last one, a good 15 minutes had passed and still the same situation. In regards to your soda glasses, you are using Samuel Adams pint glasses I think they were, these things were very frustrating, first of all not everyone likes beer and if you want to attract more families to your restaurant having every soda glass be a beer pint isn't very family friendly, but the most annoying part is every time I had a refill (at least 3 times) the ice was stuck in that center section and would drop to the bottom of the glass, just something to think about. Over all I liked the food, but all the other issues combined really make me want to rate you as 2 out of 5 stars. I was really hoping your restaurant would be added as a ""usual place"" for my wife and I but I think it's going to be in the once in a blue moon category. I hope business continues to grow for you guys and that you can dial down these little things and thrive as a business. Thanks again for the good food last night and good luck!"
2,Negative,"I love the pizza, but I've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. The first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (I think) were pretty bad. I had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. It was cold so we decided to eat inside. The smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. The pizza was good, but I don't think I'll be going back."
1,Negative,Delivery was nice. Fries had a bucket of Salt on them. Me and my brother gagged!!!Hummus wasn't fresh. Your sausage  pizza was rotten. Tasted like Mold...Terrible terrible food!!!!
1,Negative,So I couldn't tell you what Gus' pizza tastes like because they wanted a $7 service charge (before tip) on an $11 order to deliver anything.  Classic craphole that will be out of business soon.
1,Negative,"This place is a wet, dirty diaper.
The dirty food matches its dirty neighborhood. 
Their slow drivers on Oxy can't figure directions from a mile away. When delivered, their pizza was lukewarm and tasted what I assume was old lady's socks. This food will give raccoons nightmares.
Perfect food to give to an enemy or gf you are breaking up with."
2,Negative,"Food was ok, not the best just ok. Service could have been better, we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and garlic knots... They brought out everything and forgot the wings! And never even told us anything about how long it would be, we finished the pizza and Knots before the wings even came! We where told that they forgot to put them in! BS! And the manager never even came over to apologize.... Horrible customer service!"
1,Negative,"Worst delivery service in the Las Vegas Pizza Market.  The first time I ordered pizza it took 1 hour and 30 minutes to get my pizza.  This time I ordered, told them on the phone I would pay cash and they show up and tell me they don't have change for my 2 twenty dollar bills.  Really?  What a mess this place is.  I have no idea how they stay in business.  Time for me to give some of the other places a try."
1,Negative,"PASS THIS PLACE- The food and service here were awful. 

We came into this place with a reservation when we arrived in Vegas in September and right off the bat were not greeted at all. We should have known from there the experience would be bad. 

We sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food and drinks- after our drinks came, which were blah, our food  finally came. We ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs. 
The pizza was SO GREASY that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. When we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

The meatball was just ok. Nothing to write home about. 

When our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. She then said in a very rude tone that ""That is how it is and that is normal for ALL pizza"". I was offended with that remark. She has no idea what kind of pizza is normal if she thinks THAT was normal. 

Any who, the manger came over and had a very similar attitude. 

We paid our expensive tab and left- never to return, as I urge you to do the same."
1,Negative,"The positives: staff was friendly and the beer was cold. That's it. 

Two kids spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing. Noodles were cooked fine, the meatballs were small and bland, and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the noodles let alone the entire plate. And for $6 each that's ridiculous. 


We order the Mama's Supreme pizza. The order took well over 30 min for the pizza. Half the crust was burnt. The toppings were limited and the flavor was blah.  

Very disappointed and won't be returning."
2,Negative,"The last time I was at hot rocks, I had the most interesting and delicious pizza experience.  If i had written a review that time i would have given it 5 out of 5.  Oddly, I hadn't been back in quite a while until just recently.   

This time I ordered the Macedonian  pasta with a starter green salad.  The salad was unique... but not good at all. It was waaayyy  overdressed. It tasted like every ingredient had been pickled  and then doused in lemon juice. I couldn't handle more than a couple mouthfuls before I gave up. 

The pasta... looked good.... sounded good.. but again was overdressed. There was so much dried basil in the sauce.. and instead of a light pesto.. The dish was swimming in oil. I'm not kidding. It was more like oil soup with penne noodles.  

I'm was supremely disappointed.  But I will say the service was excellent. The server did come by and asked how everything was but I didn't have the courage to send my food back... 

Not saying this place doesn't know how to do pizza... and maybe I came on a bad night..  but I would be wary of ordering the pasta and salad."
2,Negative,"Bleh.

Maybe their pizza slices + pop deals are decent value, but my standard medium regular pizza (plus pineapple - yum!) was only a teeny tiny marginally fractionally  bit nicer than the same order at the neighbouring Pizza Pizza, but three dollars more expensive.

I'm also pretty sure one of the staff members who dealt with me was high. 

Judge me all you like, but I'll head back to Pizza Pizza next time."
2,Negative,"If you're looking for CHEAP, I guess this is the place.  

They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  There's a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.

The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  They had a variety of pizza to choose from.  While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.  It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (I didn't see them making it, but I wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.

The place really isn't meant for ""Pizza Snobs"" to enjoy a quality pie.  It's meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, ""Macaroni and Cheese Pizza"" as one of the types).

There were teens and families with small children everywhere.  I was the only person not there with someone under 18."
1,Negative,"Cashier Takes my order for (the last of) cheese pizza while I wait in line to buy cigarettes. 
Woman ahead is told her total, her response ""Oh yea I forgot, can I get that cheese pizza"" 
WHY ask me if you're going to make ME wait? I didnt forget to order, she did. She should have had to wait. University student vs an employee on a LIMITED break. Which was explained to her, minimum wage doesnt inspire much care for the customer... Fuck this spot"
2,Negative,"First, it took about 5 minutes of waiting before we were even noticed. Then the host told us just to sit wherever (why have a podium and a host if tou have open seating?) Our host said it would be another 15 minutes because they stoke the fire at 4, but when we sat down our waiter said it would be 45 minutes. We waited and when we got our pizza it was extremely soggy, we couldnt even hold it without one hand on the bottom. Our waiter only showed up once to half fill my water. Overall not a good experience. Go to a different grimaldi's"
2,Negative,The wait is ridiculous even for being busy. There was an hour before our pizza even went into oven. No pizza is really that worth it. I've had better.
2,Negative,"Not impressed with this place at all!

I've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time.  The sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it.... very gross.  The gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible.  The maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular.   
And you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting.  I would pass on this one."
1,Negative,Absolutely terrible service. Our server was the most clueless guy. He told us that he didn't recommend the lasagna and the extra thin crust pizza. So I ordered anyways.  Pizza was ok.  The lasagna tasted like the forest floor. This place is terrible.
2,Negative,"We ordered from this location last night for the first time in about 8 years. 

We got take out because we were busy and we wanted to take out some place close. We usually go to Little Joe's Pizza as it is our favorite, but it would have been an additional 20 minutes and everyone was hungry now. 

On the phone, we ordered the family special. One large pepperoni and a large pineapple pizza with a side of cheesy bread sticks and a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi. One we got home we discovered that their large size pizza was about 14"". Little Joe's pizzas large pizza is 16-18 inches so you can see our disappointment in the size of Pizza Huts pizza. The bread sticks were good. I liked their marinara dipping sauce. I didn't mind eating the pineapple pizza even though it seemed greasy and the crust was light and fluffy. The pepperoni tasted horrible which turned my husband off to ever ordering here again in any situation. 

I'm only giving it 2 stars due to the taste of the pepperoni pizza and the small size. For the same amount of money at Little Joe's Pizza I could have fed 2 more people so I don't feel I got the best bang for my buck."
1,Negative,"We will never go to this Sauce again. I ordered a salad and a pizza. We finished the salad and waited and waited for the pizza. I got up and asked the waitress if they forgot the pizza, she laughed and said yes that they forgot and it would be 10 min before we could get it.  She never apologized or offered to take some of the price off, nothing. Just rude!!"
1,Negative,Absolutely HORRIBLE!! Messed up the order called back to get it fixed and they were RUDE about it... Burnt the pizza and refused to replace it cuz a piece of it was missing... Ordered a geek salad and was given Italian and Caesar dressing!! Will NOT be ordering from them again!! TERRIBLE
1,Negative,"We ordered on a Wednesday at around 5:30 pm. The order arrived by 6 and was fresh and hot. It was, however, missing the potato wedges which we called the store about. They were redelivered about 45 minutes later. After calling about the wedges (which my daughter really wanted, so she didn't eat), we realized one of the pizzas was missing half the toppings. Decided not to call. The online ordering was good but does not allow for 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. Not really family friendly.

Sorry Pizza 73, not gonna order again."
1,Negative,"I ordered one small pizza and one medium pizza directly off their menu with no special additions.  That is not what was delivered to my door.  This was late on a monday night too. Not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.  

The real frustration came in trying to fix the order. After calling the place three times, I was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this.  They really need to work on the customer service. Over two hours later I was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35.

While I can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since I ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks.  This place just lost my business. Not worth the hassle.  I wish the best of luck to the rest of you!"
1,Negative,"I used to like their pizzas, but twice already I couldn't get in! First time, I get a rude employee saying that we aren't open! And tonight I rang the doorbell twice and I was ignored!

And another thing...why did you stop serving bacon on pizzas?"
1,Negative,"We ordered after EDC last night, we got home and were starving and found their menu slipped under the door of our hotel room, it took over an hour to arrive, then when it got here it was 1 pizza short and we had 1 extra two-liter bottle of Pepsi.

When we had ordered, the woman on the phone when we ordered, repeated our order back to us and it did include only 1 Pepsi and 3 pizzas instead of the two we got.

I told the delivery guy we didn't order two bottles and he just gave me attitude and said: ""It's what the receipt says, it's just $3 more"".

I didn't care that it was just $3 more, my point was we did not want two Pepsi's.

Then when we called to complain the woman on the other end of the line also had a shitty attitude saying it wasn't their fault that they took the order wrong and that they're just human, mistakes happen.

They told us we could get the pizza we were missing but we would have to return the extra Pepsi and pay the remainder of the cost of the pizza plus it would take another hour to arrive.

Worst service and attitude ever."
1,Negative,"Just got back! This is the third time in a row that pizza was burnt. Not only mine but several others as well. Also the Garlic Knots burnt. Such a shame. I do not think I will be going back to this place now. How one cannot tell when something is burnt is beyond me. Again this was the third time in a row.  Heck, even the other person sitting at another table said their fries were burnt as well... OPEN YOUR EYES before you have no more locals coming!!!"
1,Negative,"What a freak show.  Waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time.  Another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter.  They carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm.  The guy he punched eventually waited on me.  I don't know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there.  Great food.  Creepy employees.  Keep the recipe, get new help.  Others witnessed this crap.  Happened on Thursday around 7:30 pm.  Never again."
1,Negative,Completely awful.   Ordered a pizza and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the place was only 1/4 busy and they got it wrong TWICE.  We didn't realize the 2nd screw up until we got home.  We assumed after the 1st screw up and apology they'd get it right. The bartenders were dancing like they wanted to have fun but paid zero attention to our order.   WILL NEVER GO BACK.
1,Negative,Order came cold and incorrect. Ordered off Grubhub. No fault with Grubhub. Won't order pizza from this restaurant again.
1,Negative,"I would like to give it no stars.  The pizza was burnt.  We ordered a cheese plate, and the only thing they got right was the olives (which is standard).  I had to ask for the flatbread that came with it.  We ordered one cheese and two meats... I got two cheeses and one meat and it wasn't even the meat that we ordered.  My cloth napkin had holes in it.  But the bartender is flirting with my boyfriend to make it right... This place sucks."
2,Negative,Make sure you zero out the  tip area on your credit card slip when Papa Johns delivers ( used to be camfield corners now relocated to Johnston rd.. )  .... 2 times now... someone between HERE & THERE added a tip to my debit card  purchase after getting a CASH tip too.... I finally think hubby learned a lesson... !!!  Papa Johns offered us a couple free pizzas to rectify the situation.... ummmm NO..... a 5 year customer has been LOST ....and Hungry Howies has gained a NEW customer !
2,Negative,"Nice people. Very friendly.  Provided some free garlic sticks while I waited for my pizza.  I took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    While the pizza was worth $10, I would've felt a little ripped off had I paid the normal price (closer to $18 I believe).  The dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- I found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places.  While there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just ""so-so"" such that I don't really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis.  Such is the case here."
1,Negative,"Ordered 2 larges. One all dressed one plain. Received pepperoni instead of plain with giant air pockets. When called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy, I was told that it was a mistake. Yes I agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with giant air pockets in it which is also 2 inches in diameter smaller than the large ordered in the box isn't a mistake, it was intentional. I have posted the picture. Replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold. Thank, never will we order here again."
1,Negative,"Went here at 11:30 on a Tuesday, most of their menu was not available. They said they had no toppings except cheese and pepperoni. The woman at the counter was not apologetic or anything. How can you advertise as a top Vegas pizza place and only have two types of pizza a half hour after opening?

I'm vegan and we came here just for the pizza. Not to pay for parking, walk all the way in and just get turned away. Unacceptable. 

We asked if they'd have vegan pizza soon and they said ""maybe by dinner time.""

Deserving of zero stars really."
2,Negative,"UPDATE:  I revisited the place today because I thought I'd give them a second chance, after all they are just opening.

Their problem is that they haven't figured out how to do a wood-fired, thin-crust pizza.  While the toppings are very good, their pizza is greatly diminished because their crust isn't right.  Great wood-fired crust should be a bit crisp on the bottom--but NOT burnt.  Theirs is soggy.  I first went in during the evening.  This time I went in at lunch time.  There was a manager there this time who came by and asked how things were. I told her that the pizza wasn't great because the crust was soggy and tough.  She indicated that they weren't baking it long enough and would work with the cooks.  

IMHO, the difference between just average pizza and great pizza is in the crust.  It's easy to use fresh ingredients, not so easy to make a great crust.  This is where they are falling down.  Hopefully time will tell if they get this one right, but for the cost ($15+) for a 6-slize pizza and a drink with a sub-par crust is too much to pay.

=====================================================================
It is obvious that the owners put a lot of money and effort into this place.  It is very nice inside.  The seating is comfortable and well decorated. 

However, decor alone does not a restaurant make.  When I first walked in I sensed a problem because the place smelled like burned popcorn.  I dismissed that and I ordered a pepperoni, kalamata and mushroom pizza.  Pretty standard.  Their first attempt came out with the crust totally cremated.  It was scorched on the top and incinerated on the bottom, yet the center was still raw.  I took it back and asked for a re-do.  The second attempt came out a little better, but the crust was just doughy, floppy as a dish rag and basically gross.   The toppings slid off into a pile of mush on my plate.  

I think the basic problem is that the place is being staffed by a bunch of young kids.  They have no idea what they are doing, and there is no management there to help.  They have a lot of money tied up in it,  and it is a shame that there is no one there to watch the shop."
1,Negative,"The pizza here is horrible. I've ordered it a few times because it's open 24/7 and let me tell you, it's bad. Prices are great, but it doesn't make up for pizza that tastes like left over garbage dump pizza.

The delivery guys will NEVER bring the pizza to my door. They make me walk out of my complex which is quite large. I order delivery for to the door delivery, not walk, balance two pizzas and a 2 liter while trying to type my door code in... no thanks.

I also had an issue, which will be my last time dealing with these idiots. I ordered a pizza, it was never delivered, and upper management is refusing to refund my credit card of the charge. They have been giving me the run around on the issue for over two weeks, and now they are flat out ignoring me, and refusing to refund me."
2,Negative,"I find that this pizza is edible but I am confused as to why so many people think it is so spectacular-it seems to be pretty standard delivery style pizza. They have a number of non-standard toppings and specialty pizzas so that might be part of the appeal to some but I prefer plain cheese or just one topping so the quality of the sauce, cheese and crust is most important. This pizza just seems very dough heavy to me which can result in sogginess-if you like thicker crust pizza you might like this place whereas if you like thin crust pizza you probably will not."
1,Negative,Dominos is dominos. But when I walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. I had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after I ordered. This dominos is slow. Drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. Edit: our soda was flat. Seriously go get Ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one
1,Negative,"I guarantee this is the worst Pizza you could ever get go to the supermarket buy a box of frozen pizza undercook it and there you have it the same taste you will get at this restaurant terrible disgraceful this should never be called the streets of New York because New York's Pizza tastes nothing like this it is enormously much better in New York.

Don't waste your money eating here"
1,Negative,Pretty run of the mill bad pizza. Tasted like re heated tombstone or other home made. But the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok.
2,Negative,"Bad service, Bland Pizza, and really really overpriced. The whole night, we only saw our waitress maybe 3 times (not even busy, like four tables out of the whole place had people). With the pizza, there wasn't any pazzaz to it... Very bland. and lastly; with two people and no appetizers or alcohol, the bill ended up being about $75. For those prices, i'd expect a much better experience. With service and food."
2,Negative,"Take your pick: 
(Sunday evening, party of 7)
-The absentee, surly waiter
-The water dripping from the A/C ducts into our heads
-The overly greasy pizza
-The ravioli literally sitting in oil
-The half-hearted oil & vinegar dipping mixture on the table
-The high prices
-The Slow service, despite being one of only five parties dining
-The loud music that desperately screamed 'we're a cool restaurant...we promise!'"
2,Negative,"well I was hoping this place would blow my socks off, but alas, my socks stayed tightly in tact. I had been waiting for this place to open for a few weeks and been checking out the menu in the window and online (I'm at the Golds every morning, not just a creepy window stalker). We finally got a chance to go a few weekends ago and man, was I disappointed. They were busy, which is expected on a Friday night. We had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which we did but was super awkward. We ordered a few drinks and hit the menu. I ordered the deviled eggs and wifey got teh cheese plate. I went with the short ribs with blue cheese grits while wifey went with teh ricotta pizza with pork belly. The apps were done right, no complaints there. I liked the crispy bacon under the mix in the midle of the eggs, nice touch. The entrees, on the other hand, were sub par. My ""short rib"" dish was a large beef rib, and not a true short rib. I'm not THAT picky, but when I want short ribs, I want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky on a large stick. The glaze tasted good but after wrestling with the knife to cut off a few pieces, that was it. The grits were also bland, no blue cheese to be found. Wifey's pizza should have read as Pork Belly pizza  and it would have been on point. Now I know it sounds crazy to compain about too much pork belly, but the entire thing was pork belly and there was no ricotta to be found. it was also super salty and just not very good. The server comped my short ribs due to them being inedible, which was very gracious. I had high hopes for this place and will give it another shot. I'm hoping it doesn't go the way of St Francis where it's got tons of potential, but simply can't deliver"
2,Negative,"Ordered on my mobile app. When we got there, we paid and saw our pizza come out of the oven. Waited 5 minutes before the guy behind the counter got around to give us our pizza that was clearly sitting on top of the oven. He was busy cleaning he said."
1,Negative,"Man, does this place suck. TRUST THE REVIEWS! I ignored the negative ratings, and that was a mistake. I ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza with EXTRA sauce. What I got: Large pizza half pepperoni and half ham & pineapple with ""easy"" sauce?? This place is a joke. Drive to a different one - it's worth the gas."
1,Negative,"Stay away.  I'm a woman that just experience verbal assault by a sexist manager.

This is the most disturbing experience I've ever had. They completely messed up our pizza order, took an hour to deliver it then an hour to come back and reimburse us then wanted the whole pizza back as if we should pay for their mistake by not eating.  when we told them we had already eaten some of it they wouldn't reimburse us.

When I talked to the manager about it he was rude.  He talked over me, When I said this was not very good customer service he said ""so what"".  

The managers name is Rick and he's sexist misogynist and a very bad man.  

Also the food is terrible."
2,Negative,"So we recently moved to Brookline and this place is just up the road. Having a great pizza shop within walking distance is a great thing, unfortunately it is not this place... After two orders of undercooked pizza we tried a final time tonight and specifically asked for the pizza ""well done"" hoping that way it would come out cooked correctly. Sadly this was the most undercooked yet and since neither of us enjoy raw dough we won't be back.."
1,Negative,"Ive eaten here twice now. Both times were a great disappointment. First time I ordered pizza it was burnt so badly I couldnt eat it. 
The second time I ordered the meatballs and pasta. The sauce is so bland it makes store bought taste great ! 
Please do yourself a huge favor and try one of the many other restaurants in town. You will thank me later."
2,Negative,"Been going to Nello's for years, but after last night, I'm taking some time off and spending my pizza $ elsewhere.  Not crowded, table for 3 in the bar....2 entrees came out quickly while I waited for a woodfired pizza.  My wife's salad was missing the pancetta as advertised.  My pizza finally arrived but was made incorrectly...I was told no problem, we'll make another one....waited, waited and bingo ANOTHER wrong pizza - this time it wasn't even close. After 2 hours I asked for the check and I'm gone.  Nello's get it together please and do something about your pizza dough - it's like cardboard lately.  Headed to Florencia for a while....and so is my $."
2,Negative,What to say about this place didn't really get a try the pizza too much after waiting 40 minutes for the food they made it wrong the couple bites that I had I was not impressed at all Italian beef that's horrible I think I could have got better sandwich at Arby's the Greek salad was very small mediocre dressing had no flavor the tomato soup tastes like something out of a can overall very disappointed only thing it made it worthwhile was the manager comp in the mail and sending us home with a spinach pizza tried that one was not very good but thanks to the manager I will give it another chance maybe in a few months after they've been open for a while
1,Negative,This is a pizza 73 place with a different name same crap pizza and same horrible wings just like 73 only you pay more money for the pizza here then at 73 and it's the exact same product plus it Took them one and half hours to deliver it to my  place 10mins away on a Wednesday night I'm  being generous with the 1 star rating
2,Negative,I've been here twice now. The first time I wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke. I ended up only ordering a shake. I went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running). I was not impressed. I'm not sure what was weird about. The sauce? The cheese? I've had way better pizzas. Loved the milkshake. I give it two stars because my husband likes it and I have to tolerate it for him.
1,Negative,"I feel bad giving this place such a bad review based on my experience a couple of months ago, and never usually dislike places this much, but here I am.  I am a resident of the Bloor/Kingsway area in which this restaurant is situated.  Now if you know the strip of Bloor where this restaurant is, you know that every second place is a restaurant, and they are all pretty busy.  With the selection of restaurants in this area and other Italian restaurants in Etobicoke (just go to La Veranda around the corner!!) I don't know how this place stays open based on my experience.  There is just so much better Italian in Etobicoke to be had.

Anyways, I have been here twice.  The first time was something like 2 or 3 years ago with a friend for a casual dinner and I think I may have had a salad or something.  I don't really remember my experience, I just remember I wasn't unhappy with it and generally enjoyed the experience and decor of the restaurant. But this review isn't based on that.

So a couple of months ago my boyfriend and I were craving Italian and wanted to go somewhere close by.  I wanted to go somewhere new and my boyfriend hadn't been there before.  Being a creature of habit, he wanted to go to La Veranda around the corner which is an Etobicoke failsafe of ours but I insisted on coming to Sempre.

My boyfriend went to culinary school and is a sous chef at a very busy Italian restaurant in Toronto and he really found the menu to be lacking.  He wasn't super hungry and ordered a pizza.  I ordered a pasta (don't remember what it originally was now) which took a super long time to come (even though it wasn't very busy), and when it finally came out I noticed that it really did not seem to match the description of the pasta that I had ordered.  I recall that when giving my order to the waitress she seemed slightly confused with what I had asked for even though what I had ordered was right there on the menu, and I didn't ask for it with any changes or anything.  I recall the pasta I originally had ordered was supposed to have a white sauce and the one I received had a rose sauce, as well as being tortellini.  I was honestly so hungry at that point and not one to complain anyways that I just decided to eat it.  Well, if what I had received had turned out to be good I wouldn't have been too unhappy but I honestly would equate the pasta and sauce to some crappy wedding banquet hall food.  The tortellini had no flavour and tasted like something I could have boiled at home from a package from Costco.  The pasta was definately not made in house.  The sauce was probably the worst part and made me dislike it so much.  It was just too thick, had no flavour, and just so reminescent of crappy banquet hall food and generally unpleasant.  The pizza was not up to par of what you would expect to find from an Italian resto in Toronto, had not much sauce and the crust wasn't great.  

There are tons of options along the Bloor strip, if you really want Italian skip this and go to La Veranda around the corner."
1,Negative,"Something has changed for the worse here.  We are long time regulars and I have to agree with Erica V that on the last two pizzas the crust has been soggy / gummy and the sauce was runny / watery even when ordered well done and crispy.  So much so I called the manager last night. This used to be good pizza but sadly no longer. They've either changed ingredients, recipes and/or chefs.  Last week's sausage pizza tasted like bagged hospital grade meat."
1,Negative,"I always get good pizza from here. 

Tonight I called in my order and drove down to wait for it. As I was sitting waiting in front of the big glass window,  A driver pulls up, walks in and when the other guys went to the back he grabbed some chicken pieces and shoved it in his mouth. Then he proceeded to stick every one of his fingers into his mouth up to his knuckles. I'm not exaggerating. Then he wipes his mouth with the same hand. Then his nose, then he did his fingers again. Then his nose again. And his fingers one last time. 

 I thought he would at least wash his hands, but then he grabbed someones wings then he took a pizza did something with it then put the order out for pick up. I walked in real quick and asked the guy who just walked up to the counter if that order is mine, he said no I said good because if that is mine i don't want it. I told him what happened and he told the guy to wash his hands..... I feel bad for the people who had this guy deliver their food tonight around 6:15pm. YUCK"
2,Negative,"Hit or miss. The first time I went the food was AMAZING so much so I I went back for a second time in a week. The first time I got a 'build your own pizza' with Alfredo sauce and chicken. The second time I ordered the same thing and they forgot the Alfredo but put it on the side, okay fine it was still good. Today, I ordered food to pick up and ordered the same pizza for a third time. I was told they didn't have Alfredo sauce for pizza only white garlic or red sauce (even after having it twice!)  I asked if they could put the Alfredo on the side like the did before, the woman taking my order said they could ( I don't understand why it can be put on the side and not the pizza.) I picked up the food and brought it home and the ""Alfredo"" was literally warm milk with salt at the bottom LITERALLY! Needless to say, I'm beyond angry. The quality has gone down consistently since my first visit, I won't be returning."
2,Negative,"I lost a little faith in this city by how celebrated this place is. Serviceable at best. Cheese blend is highly questionable, mine was rubbery really. Crust was ok. If you think this is the ultimate then I question your dedication to pizza consumption.

PS: The spot is cash only, which is also annoying."
1,Negative,"DO NOT!!!!! Order through Romano's pizzeria. Horrific customer service. I was told that I would not be refunded my $20 order...  for my extremely cold pizza that they said was fresh out the oven. The pizza felt like it had been sitting out for a few hours ... that's absolutely disgusting.... the manager refused to refund me $20... 
I waited in my car with my 2 month old new born for almost an hour!!!! To get an extremely cold disgusting pizza. Again what horrific customer service. We had to buy an ALBOA pizza to sastify our  pizza craving...  I would highly recommend NOT ordering through this disgusting horrific cold gross pizza place. They don't care about what they serve you. & again the customer service was absolutely Terrible!!!!! My pooor new born child having to wait in the car for over an hour because they didn't have their times right. For a disgusting cold pizza that not even my dog would eat. If you want awful gross pizza then this is your place ... other then that spend your money elsewhere. Would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE!!!!! In this lifetime."
1,Negative,"I came in to the restaurant at 4:30pm. It was mostly empty, however the service was slow and inattentive. 

I ordered the clam pizza and am sorry I did. The only clams on the pizza were 1-2 still in the shell on each slice. You had to scrape them out yourself. I would rather eat my pizza rather than work for it. Furthermore, this resulted in very little crab meat on the pizza. Lastly, there were clam shells broken off and melted into the pizza. They were hard to see. Thus, there were 2-3 bites I literally has to spit out as I was chewing clam shells. 

When I pointed this out to the waitress Amanda she said sorry and she would tell the chef. She even admitted that this was not the first time this has happened. Despite my complaint there was not an offer to deduct a portion of the bill or offer of free dessert or something to compensate. 

Disappointing."
1,Negative,"Just got delivery from here and wtf... ordered the half sheet pizza and at some point it was evidently sideways from there to here. We got 2 toppings on one side, 2 on the other and when we opened it, about 1/4 of the pizza was ""mine"" as the other ingredients had slid over. This in itself might not be a problem - I could maybe give it an ""eh, whatever,"" but then in taking 2 bites, I knew that for how greasy the pizza was, if I ate it my digestive system would be in for a cleansing if you know what I mean. 

I called them back and said I wanted my credit card refunded. She had to call the owner. The driver promptly came back with a ""Transaction Voided"" receipt and I was told that the amount would be credited to my account within 2-3 business days. Oh, and incidentally, they even asked us to return the 2 liter of soda - so we had to pour it back into the bottle from our glasses. I should have said I was keeping it for the inconvenience, but you know, whatever. 

Needless to say I will NOT be ordering from Nunzio's again."
2,Negative,Kinda disappointing. It was a late night pick and kinda wanted to send it back. The veggies and meats on pizza was delicious but the crust seem pre-made and the cheese and sauce had no flavor.
1,Negative,This is pretty bad pizza. We ordered because it could be delivered to hotel  ...tastes like cardboard very light on toppings...I would never order again. I think it might be frozen Digorno. The salads were lettuce w three tomato slices..some of lettuce was turning.
2,Negative,"This review is based my latest experience. I have always ordered from Magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. I ordered Hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. Now Magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  I used the Eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. The food arrived 15 minutes later.  So it took 10 minutes to cook the food. Doesn't pizza take longer to cook? The bell peppers were missing from the pizza. It must  have been pre-made. The fingers were greasy and tasted weird. I should have taken a picture. The fries were good. Had to throw the fingers out. Won't be ordering from there for a while."
1,Negative,"Ordered and picked up two pizza's tonight, asked for extra sauce on them. No extra sauce on either and didn't get much cheese on one of them that was suppose to be half cheese half sausage. Called and spoke to Saba the manager and he said it was my fault for ordering extra sauce, ""the cheese sucked up the sauce"". What?! Refused to replace. Never had this problem before. Not worth $45 I spent for two pizza's."
1,Negative,"So yeah, I'm reviewing a chain. I wanted to try the ""new and improved"" Domino's Pizza. Everything those commercials said about their old pizza was true-- cardboard crust, ketchup sauce, bad toppings. So, is the new Domino's better than the old? 

Yes, but that's not saying much-- it moves up from negative stars to 1, perhaps1.5 stars. The cheese and toppings are much improved. The cheese abundant and tasty and the mushrooms were thickly sliced whole brown mushrooms. Really good. The sauce was a bit salty and bland-- not horrible, but nothing to write home about. 

They still have a problem with the crust. The crust on both mediums we ordered was mushy and underdone. While it wasn't as blatantly offensive as old Domino's crust, it still had a lingering aftertaste like those Bisquick pancakes mom used to try to feed us in the 1970s. Add to that an abundant dusting of garlic salt and you've got a taste reminiscent of your first boyfriend's attempt to make you an ""Italian"" dinner with garlic bread. I had no idea they even made garlic salt any more. It hasn't improved. 

So, the pizza has improved, but not enough for me to ever eat it again."
1,Negative,I normally order pizza from this location on a regular basis. I would carry out but this was my 1st time having it delivered...I completed my order at 7:00 it was confirmed on the delivery tracking that the order would be delivered at 7:37 well I did not get my order until 8:15. Almost 40 mins after the tracker staled that I would have my food. The pizza was cold and my wings were under cooked. I called the establishment and was told I could get a free pizza :( the manager stated that she would used this as a coaching opportunity for her drivers. Honestly that is not my issue. It will be a while before I return here.
1,Negative,Seriously the worst service I have ever got in my life . We called in to order a pizza and the kid on the phone couldn't even figure out how to take my order then I told them 3 different times we had cash and to please bring change for it . You think they brought change ? Nope they tried to give us change back as if we were tipping the kid 20$ for the delivery . 3 timesssss I told them .  Horrible cold pizza too I will never eat with Pizza Hut ever again . Ever!!!
1,Negative,"Went in for lunch, looked good so I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, and some garlic Parmesan fries. They burned the pizza and under cooked the fries. But to top it off, the order came to $10.27(pricy but whatever its vegas), and I gave them a dollar tip (wrote on the reciet and even totaled it out for them). When I went to check my bank account, they charged me $12.32... I hate to be anal about one dollar, but they did not deserve it and it was blindly taken from me, from right under my nose. The woman cashier was nice but the gentleman cook seemed like an asshole and gave me a sassy look when I asked for a side of ranch. No mention of the ranch costing extra or anything.. I would of paid for it.. Assuming it cost a dollar.. I guess I did pay for it. Whatever, last time I visit them."
1,Negative,One star because I can't tell you if the pizza is any good because every time I call they put me on hold.  First time 10min so figured they forgot I was on hold. So Hung up &  called back when they asked if they could put me on hold I said no &  they put me on hold anyway.
2,Negative,"If you think this is good pizza, you need to get out more. I tried two kinds: the bronze dragon and the breakfast pizza. I honestly couldn't tell you which was supposed to be which. Maybe it was because the line was long, but the crust was underdone and too doughy, and the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink. I'm not from the Midwest and I have yet to find pizza that even comes close to what I'm used to in PA/NJ/NY."
1,Negative,"Ok, so I've been ordering from this location for months now and each time the delivery service is getting worse. Im at the point that i will not order from then anymore and will not tell anyone of my family or friends to order from them ever after today. I ordered their $25 coupon of 2 large 2 topping pizzas and 20 wings today. I placed this order at 12:35 pm and as told it would take an hour for delivery(which seemed a bit excessive at this time of day. Since it was after lunch rush). So as the hour mark came and then went the order was still not here. At 20 minutes after the hour it was still not here, so I called them to ask where my order was since its now been an hour and 20 minutes. The girl on the phone proceeds to go on to tell me that the order was out for delivery and quickly got off the phone. So again I sat outside waiting and again another 10 minutes went by and no order. I called back again and this time the girl put me on hold to see where the delivery girl was at. She came back on the line and tried to tell me that there was traffic that delayed the driver and that she was less then 5 minutes away. Now that began to irritate me since they are only 3 miles from where I live. There's not that much traffic that would delay a delivery by 30 minutes. The girl just kept saying she was sorry and never offered up any comps of any kind to show any customer appreciation to keep me as a customer. I then asked her what they were going to do to compensate me for not having my food by an hour and a half. She then says oh well I can give you a $10 credit on your account for your next order. I said fine and hung up expecting my order in under 5 minutes as they claimed. Well that was a lie yet again as it took the driver an additional 12 minutes to finally show up. So now its been an hour and 42 minutes; the driver got out and acted like nothing was wrong. She asked ""hi how's your day going?"" I responded with ""it would have been better if my order was here over 40 minutes ago, on time."" She then got very snotty quick and snapped ""well there's only one of me and your total is $30.58."" I said ""well I would like to check to see if my food was still hot before I pay for it."" She pulled out one pizza and handed it to me and I checked it. Granted it wasnt as hot as all my other orders from before but it was warm enough that I went ahead and paid for it. I then handed the driver $40 and she said ""let me get your change."" The change should have been $9.42 she came back and handed me only $9 not even saying sorry I don't have any change, change she just assumed she could keep the 42 cents and hesitated like I was going to give her more for a tip.  Well now I'm seeing red so that's all she got as her tip was the 42 cents she assumed she could just keep and I walked away from her. This whole delivery was the worse experience I have ever had from this place. They acted as though my order didn't matter in any way. They acted like they were irritated with me for being upset for not having my food for over and hour and 40 minutes. It will be awhile before I order from them again if I do decide to."
1,Negative,"I ordered Sophia pizza and I was expecting a delicious food with proper spice. What I ended up eating was testing horrible , super spicy which burned my mouth. I couldn't even have the second slice. The funny thing is we checked the menu to see if there was any indication of the spiciness of the food! No! Nothing . I'm assuming they just dropped the bottle of pepper in the pizza hoping no one will notice."
1,Negative,"Bad service and never enough cheese pizza, this place used to be good but it's gone downhill."
2,Negative,"I've ordered late night delivery for pizza, pasta ans wings as an experiment. Everything sucked. I will never order from them again."
1,Negative,"I ordered there Brooklyn style Philly cheese steak Pizza. I asked for them to put the  garlic crust but I guess the forgot. When I opened up my pizza box I was extremely disappointed  there was little to no meat on the pizza litterly only about two slices had meat on a large pizzs... wtf I did order a philly cheese stake.  Know $23 latter and still dissatisfied.
With so many other pizza options around idk if I will be back."
2,Negative,"If you LOVE Lou Malnatis like I do, you will be very disappointed by this pizza. We ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. The pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! Wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! Won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to Lou's!"
1,Negative,"Just dined here this evening. I have to say this place had hands down the worst service I have ever received. Party of 3 adults, the server suggested we order 3 pizzas and an appetizer. We were not interested in their limited appetizer menu so we decided to skip it and ordered the pizzas. It took 45 minutes to get the food, I know they bake it fresh so I was willing to wait but the pizzas were bland and overpriced. And we had 1 and 3/4 pizza left, her suggestion of 3 pizzas was far too much food. Honestly, I would skip this one."
2,Negative,"We had heard some good things about this place....so we were excited.  However, it's sub-par at best.  Service was slow and rude....a rarity in this part of Wisconsin, and the pizza was edible but I don't understand why people think it's that good.  We won't be back."
2,Negative,"I have been to custom built 3 times now the first time was before my yelp days and I boosted all over facebook about it. I let all my friends and family know how awesome of a place it was as well as how awesome the customer service was. I think things have changed since then. 

Allow me to elaborate, the second time I went to custom built I quickly left the restaurant and choose not to dine there because I was turned off by this one employee today I went back and have found that the employees name is Larry. The time I walked out was because Larry was on the phone in the back and came out front to greet us. When he came out he was holding his cell phone in his hand and asked to wait a second as he finished his call, we didn't see this as a problem so we patiently waited. When Larry returned he had his cell phone in his hand and was hanging it up he placed the phone on a back counter came to the front and asked what type of dough we would like to choose. He quickly grabbed a regular ball of dough and was about to start kneeding it when I stopped him and apologized to him and told him loud and clear that I could not dine at his establishment since I did not see him wash his hands and we walked out. Bummed out by the incident I still did not want to simply stray away because of one employee so I told my wife we would give it some time and try again.

Well we did and we re-tried today. Like I said previously today the same employee that I walked out on was there and he was at the door. I take it that he did not remember the incident as he did not even recognize me. I thought that was great so that I could try and get a new experience and try and forget about the previous incident. I have to say the evening staff that first introduced my wife and I to custom built was exceptional they were up beat and seemed excited to just make a pizza. Today it felt like it was Monday and things were just crawling. If it was not for that one awesome employee that was genuinely happy to be at work I would have walked out once again that employee's name is MOE and the first thing that he did when he saw us and asked us the dough we wanted was go to the sink and wash his hands!! I quickly pointed it out to my wife and said look at that exceptional employee that is washing his hand prior to preparing our food. Moe quickly keeded out the dough and placed it on the order line to get prepared. Excited by a happy employee this made me happy and I quickly remembered the first time I went to custom built. I said to the gentlemen that was preparing my pizza the first time I came here the young man that assisted me suggested to try and get creative instead of having the same mundane pizza. He suggested trying multiple sauces and I remember him saying you can split this pizza into 16th's to try and give us a challenge we love challenges. When I mentioned this to the guy that was helping me today he seemed a little put off by the whole thing and even said I don't know why he would suggest trying so many different things. I ordered the pizza in 3rds so that I could try the different sauces 1 pesto 1 alfredo and 1 spicy. The guy seemed very uncertain on how to spread the sauces in thirds so he just made circles that ended up bleeding into each other in the cooking process. I layered and layered my pizza with topping after topping after topping. I always have fun in that part I feel like I'm a kid again when I get to pick and choose. 

My wife placed he order and I went to pay. When I was paying Larry was at the cash register and I told him that I forgot my belly card but had received the message that all custom built pizzas were 6.95 for the month of April. He said ok and then I showed him my yelp 10% off for checking in for the first time he again shook his head to which I thought was a clear sign for him acknowledging it. I paid the tab and was just handed my change. I thought that was a bit odd so I asked if I could have my receipt. Larry printed a receipt and gave it to me, I say a receipt because I was unsure if it was actually mine I paid with a $100.00 bill and did not nee that on the receipt and I also did not see a discount. I didn't want to be rude and be like YO! WHERE MY DISCOUNT SON!! so I just kept quite and said to myself the food will clearly change my mind and it will be worth every penny.

Well I got my pizza and it was totally not what I expected the sauces had all bleed into each other and I could not tell the difference from what was pesto what was spicy and where the alfredo started and ended. Also today I watched as Larry was at the cash register and then went to make a pizza for a guest with out washing his hands AGAIN!!!! SOME ONE NEEDS TO GO OVER SAFE FOOD HANDLING WITH LARRY BEFORE HE GETS SOMEONE SICK!! 

I don't know if I can try custom built again and I was a fan :(!"
1,Negative,"My last visit

Placed a ""to go"" order 3 small pizzas, 2 with pepperoni and 1 with pepperoni and sausage, all with Asiago flavored crust. I walked in to Hungry Howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty.  However, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge I was there and  to get my order. 

The pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas I have ever had from Hungry Howies and the order wasn't even correct. I wish I would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store.  I called Hungry Howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn't correct.  The associate who answered the phone response was ""Sorry bout that, not sure who cooked it.  I guess we can cook another"".  After waiting another 20 minutes to cook another pizza I head back up to Hungry Howies and yes, once again my order wasn't correct (wrong flavor crust). Since I wasn't willing to wait another 20 minutes I took the pizza and headed home.

My previous experiences with Hungry Howies has always been hit or miss. I think I will drive a little further to one of the many other pizza places in my area."
1,Negative,"O STARS an Option? 

Used to come here years ago as a young child, raced all kinds of laps weekly (first opened). Over the years this place has gone down hill! The owner and his son are douchers, cocky, and selfish. They don't care about their employees just their customers that are giving the creedy individuals money on some sort. This place is WAY too over priced for some childish electric carts, buy some (real) gas go-karts.. and take one for a REAL race. The employees are unprofessional, they stand around the counters on their phones, and don't pay attention to the race track for a second set of eyes. 

They don't wear gloves cooking pizzas

You're better off going to FAST LAP or somewhere else with GAS go-karts, and more reasonable prices!"
1,Negative,"As a native Chicagoan I grew up going to Giordano's  as well as the other top Chicago style pizza joints.  I know good Chicago pizza - this is NOT it!  The pizza was undercooked and frankly gross.  My husband, myself and my daughter could not eat it.  We even thew out our leftovers the moment we got home.  They are doing Chicago style pizza a disservice.  The chopped salad was delicious.  The mozzarella triangles were great.  The wait for a table was minimal.  The wait for the pizza was 45 mins as expected.  The restaurant was nice.  The staff was nice.  The high chair was even clean (harder to find then you think).  But if a pizza place can't put out amazing pizza, nothing else matters."
1,Negative,"A couple weeks ago, My friends and I arrived in Phoenix, starving, at about 1am with a 12 hour layover. We shuttled to a motel and discovered our only options were Jack in the Box drive-thru (no car) and Gus's. I'm not going to credit this place with an elaborate review. I didn't know pizza could taste this bad. I mean how do u mess up a pizza. I am not a food critic and I am not picky by any means. My friend could only stomach two slices and he can EAT! The pizza was flavorless, tasted like water just like one other reviewer mentioned and upon swallowing, the cardboard box seemed the more edible of the two. I'm not even kidding. 
I must also mention the price. I know beggars can't be choosers. I don't mind paying out the ear for a edible meal when it's a last resort. 
We paid $50. and change including $5 tip for the ""two gnarly pizzas and disgusting chicken wings special"".   
Included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee."
2,Negative,"Pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. They don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  I don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. Our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered."
1,Negative,Last night my family at CiCis  Pizza.  We hadn't eaten in this restaurant for about a year and boy have they changed.  The restaurant is under staffed.  We went up to the counter quite a few times and there were not any pizza's.  It's hard to believe you go to a pizza buffet and NO PIZZA.  We waited 20 minutes for a desert pizza to be made.  There were a few people working really hard but they needed more people.  The floor had old napkin and it took quite a few minutes for the 1 person to take our used plates away.  We will never go back.
2,Negative,"Pizzas are salty. All the time every time. I don't know why 
My kids think it's gonna be better next time. No matter what kinda of pizza it's going to be salty. They also use cheddar cheese on most pizzas.  The salads are good and we have had the Pablo Picasso a couple of times.  The dirty monkey drink I ordered was mostly ice so the next one I ordered I asked if I could have ""light ice"" and when she brought me this the glass was just over half full to ""compensate"" for the ""light ice"".  This was odd in my opinion. The first Dirty Monkey I had was so full of ice that it was all that hit my lip as I drank it."
1,Negative,"Thought I'd give them one more chance, tonight still zero hot and ready pizzas and now the customers are stealing sauces when the cashier leaves the counter, which is more often than she's there."
1,Negative,"Doughy pizza with a bad sauce. 

Plus I ordered mozarella sticks and they did not deliver them, charged me for them, and refused a refund. 

Do not support this business."
2,Negative,"I'm giving them one star because they produce pizza that is among the best in the city and another star because they've proven that Corsa Italia can support a dinning scene that is kicked up a notch.  
The prices are a little high for what they offer and the service could be given some pointers and from what I've seen and read on other sites from past employees, the proprietors and management can use an attitude adjustment.  A server belittled the busboy in front of us once when the busboy brought to me a glass of wine that was only half full.  Another time our white wine was room temperature.  We brought it up with our server who reminded me of Yosemite Sam and wouldn't have looked out of place at a Tea Party rally informed me that white wine is served at a higher temperature than beer.  Yes, thank you tips, now can you please replace my 22 degree wine.  While he did correct the situation in the end, we received the cold shoulder the rest of the evening.  When it came time to paying our bill there was a drink missing from it, we informed him and while we didn't expect him to kiss our feet, didn't receive much more than a, ""uh, ya, thanks."" then printed us a new bill.  
There are many new pizzerias that have opened up with great service and while I appreciate their contribution in terms of atmosphere and food, snooty ""QSA"" isn't what St. Clair West needs."
2,Negative,The pizza is ok nothing to brag about and the service sucks had to go to the counter to get my drinks refilled and they looked at me like I had three heads.
1,Negative,"This place has great pizza but my experience with this location has been awful. They either take over an hour to get you a pizza or they don't deliver it at all. The first time I tried to order a pizza from here they ended up being closed because of a management issue and I never got my pizza (I never got charged) but I also had to wait an hour and a half before realizing it was never coming.

The second time I ordered we had to call about delivery and they had the address written down as Camelflower instead of Camelback. Took about 90 mins. 

The third time I tried to order a pizza it took 90 mins before it was delivered and that was only after I called to check in on it. They gave me a free pizza credited to my account as a result. 

Now, I'm sitting here waiting for yet another pizza that was quoted as being delivered in 45 mins.. It has been 90 minutes, again. We called to check in on the pizza (see a trend?) and they said they only had one driver. Now, I'm wondering if my pizza is going to be cold. 

Bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. The food is good but the experience is awful. Stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (I could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). If you're wondering why Domino's or Pizza Hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the art of pizza delivery. Either figure your system out, or give it up. 

If you're wondering if you should try this place then you should drive to the location and enjoy the food. Don't wait for your pizza to be delivered. You might starve."
1,Negative,"Golly, I would tell people not to go here. I simply ask for four pizzas, two with pepperoni, one with olives, and one with pineapple. They gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. I can't eat meat. I was with another person, who didn't mind the other topping on his pepperoni. I went back to let them know they made a mistake. I was charged for two more pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. I saw someone tell the cook, how the pizzas should be made. Once I got my two pizzas, they had pepperoni with olives and pepperoni with pineapples. AGAIN! I was on lunch, there was no point for asking to fix this problem again because I had to go back to work. Brought it up to them, ask them if I could just get my money back since I can't eat the pizzas they made me. I was told I could not get my money back only credit. I don't want credit because that was my lunch money to eat. I was told by the employees,""mistakes happen."" After I ask for my money back. Which I understand mistakes do happen, I work in customers service too. But when I see an employee tell the cook how the pizzas should be made, one with only olives and one with only pineapple, and both pizzas still end up having pepperoni on it. That's not just a mistake. Which I still have the receipt that's says cheese pizzas with olives and pineapple."
1,Negative,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! i purchased a Groupon deal for family meal: large cheese pizza, 20 wings, 2 L soda. WORST pizza EVER!!we ordered over the phone and picked up the order.it was so greasy, the oil soaked through the box onto my car seat. the flavor is so-so-similar to frozen. the cheese was low quality, the crust was blahh, and the worst part: the sauce was thinly spread.the wings were hard, dry, and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.the soda was the only thing our family can use. we also ordered manicotti,some Beach title pizza, and garlic knots. manicotti was okay. Beach pizza was same as cheese pizza with only meager toppings thinly spread out. the garlic knots were hard enough to toss like a rock.we had to order from Papa John's.it is so true: if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is.."
2,Negative,"I think I expected more from this place because its supposed to be ""New York"" pizza and the decor of the restaurant is decorated very New York-ish.  But I guess it is New York style, thin crust, sliced pizzas ready in the display window... but as for the taste, yeah not so much.  

The couple times I ordered pizza from there, the crust was semi burned with black burn spots on the crust and on the bottom.  The cannolis were just OK and smaller than others I've had.  

Maybe I'm just comparing it too much to the ""real thing"" and being biased.  Word of advice:  Less than a mile down the road is Rocco's NY Pizza... definitely go there instead!!!"
1,Negative,"No place settings - had to steal from empty table.  Dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? Frozen pizza kinda quality. Salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce."
1,Negative,"BAD EXPERIENCED EVERRRR!!! never in my life have complained to any businesses but this Domino's Pizza have the bad service and take forever to have the order ready! took me about  1 hour and 45 minutes (or more) to have my order ready! and gave me attitude!!! what kind of service is thissss????? WOULD never come back here again! ever. 

it deserve 0 star but no choice! anyhowwww, the foods are fine though. if you ever consider ordering pizza from this place. just call in and come pick up in 2 hours! many people were complaining and cancelled orders!!"
1,Negative,"IM USUALLY NOT THIS KIND OF GUY BUT SOMETIMES A BUSINESS DESERVES TO BE PUBLICLY SLAMMED FOR A SOLID PATTERN INCOMPETENCE...There isn't a -4 rating??? So I ordered 5 deep dish pizzas, 2 cheese and 3 pepperoni... pretty simple right? Hard to really screw that up I would think? 
I don't know how hard it is to actually take an order and see it through because I've never worked there but I think it would be easy with computers n stuff, or a pen and paper idk maybe it is a hard job..? 
Anyway I had someone go pick the order up, he didn't know exactly what I ordered but when he came back I ended up with 4 pepperoni pizzas and 1 cheese... 

****This has been FIVE TIMES IN A ROW THEY HAVE COMPLETELY GIVIN ME A DIFFERENT ORDER I HOPE THE WORLD SEES THIS AND AVOIDS THE PLACE, drive down the road a bit further and go to another Ceasars, trust me it's worth the gas****
So that's that, ya lost a customer obviously ya don't care because the last two times I got the wrong order I brought it to their attention but yet you all STILL manage to keep a strong track record of screwing up the most important part, THE ORDER!"
1,Negative,"I just tried to order a pizza for delivery and got a phone call from the general manager saying that they don't deliver to where I live in DeForest.  Except they delivered to my house within the last two weeks!  The manager argued with me saying they never have and told me they don't have record of any orders from my phone number, which I updated when I last ordered online and on their delivery map my address is included.  He basically called me a liar to my face, even though the pizza box from their last delivery to my house is still in the garage waiting to go out with the recycling.  If you changed your coverage area fine, but don't be a jerk to a customer and call them a liar.  I have a medical degree and am not some confused idiot.  Then I got an email saying that my order was being made.  The manager said that they don't deal with online stuff in their store.  Someone needs to get on the same page and be consistent.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've experienced in years!  I will never order from this franchise nor any other in the area and will be sure to pass along to my friends how they treat customers.  I was so excited to find out they delivered here only to be disappointed.  It's a shame too, because their gluten free pizza was pretty good.  Save yourself the grief and go to Salvatore's Tomato Pie's instead.  Way better pizza and way nicer people!!!"
1,Negative,"Customer service from the order taker and driver were decent, but this place serves really, really terrible food. I should have known, but I was drawn by what I thought was an awesome coupon deal. You know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? That's not the case here. It reeked of onions.

The pizza was undercooked and bare. I had the Supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. Also, I never thought anyone could screw up Buffalo wings. It's just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn't even do that. The wings looked unsauced and when I asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. After a closer inspection I understood, and it was right then and there that I realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. Besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. The wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. That was most likely the case. I tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future.

I am hoping I can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. I wish I could get a refund, but I don't want to put up a fight just to hear that they won't provide one. Potential customers, please do yourself a favor and stay clear; the only valuable thing you'd be ordering here is a life lesson."
2,Negative,"Unfortunately, this place could not live up to the hype created. The cheese bread was fine but nothing to write home about. You should not go here when you are very hungry because the pizza takes about 45 min to an hour to prepare. Sadly, there was a mistake in the kitchen with our pizza and we waited for 1 1/2 hour for our pizza to be prepared properly. This would have been forgivable if the pizza lived up to my expectations. It did not. It was not even edible. The only saving grace at this place was the staff. Everyone was pleasant and that means a lot. Although, I'm doubtful the friendly service was enough for me to try again. Very disappointing."
1,Negative,"The coffee is nothing special and the pizza is like eating dry flavorless cardboard. The older guy behind the bar is an A.H., never smiles and is quit rude. McDonald's at least gives you a smile and has decent coffee.  I'll go to St Clair if I want a good coffee served p[politely."
2,Negative,"Tried the pizza for the first time today, I was expecting NY style pizza which it was not. Was with some co-workers, one of the girls asked for the soup of the day as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have one, asked for the free passion bread when dinning in, as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have any because the manager wasn't there and the cooks don't listen to the waiters/waitresses we were told. Overall it was ok."
1,Negative,after ordering two soups and a small cheese pizza and spending 35 dollars my order arrives and I get soup and an everything pizza ? I call and tell them they sent the wrong order they apologize and say they will send the correct order right now do after an hour I call and they say that the phone person that took my order left for the night and forgot to put the order in... then got a little nasty as I was up set them sent another pizza 30 minuteslater... 3 hrs for a pizza and the soup was very salty to the point that I wished I opened a can of soup ... go else were... I guess I didn't learn my lesson
1,Negative,Tried it today.  This pizza did not hold up to the reviews on here.  Bitondo is better and it's close enough to Fresca.  This is not New York pizza. If you go there with this expectation you will be disappointed.  Pizza Nova is better too.
2,Negative,"Came here for my cousins birthday...
OK first its in the Mandalay bay hotel so its pretty loud out there. Next the place is really nice, it has a pretty cool decor that reminded me of little italy. 
So first off the waiter sucked so that means that our service sucked big time. We ordered ice teas and he brought it out like 15 minutes after we ordered it. I had to remind the waiter about our ice teas!!!
Food was bleh, it was not that good, 
OK the pizza sauce was really sweet and it felt like i was eating pizza sauce with sugar. Oh and that huge chunk of mozzarella cheese in the middle made it perfect, ewww the cheese was just in one place. Ever thought of spreading it out????? 
The only thing good here is the bread and butter and the tiramisu. 
I do not think that I will be back  to this place."
1,Negative,Don't expect to get a pizza around dinner time on a Friday. Ordered ours today at 6:30 pm was told 45 mins to an hour and it's 10 pm and still not here. Called at 7:45 asking where it was and was told its being delivered. Called again at 8:15 to find out it was never even sent out but will be the next one delivered. Clearly not the case... Hopefully I get it before tomorrow. If I could rate them a half star I would
1,Negative,Went to Scarborough location. Burnt garlic. Fake Italian food. Loud club music. Do not recommend to anyone with a taste bud or self respect. The Sunday sauce was not. The pizzas are not. The carbonara was oven bake. WTF. And to insult Carbonara even more it was served on Penne!  Go somewhere else.
1,Negative,"Ordered two pizzas Friday night (June 19th). They were delivered quickly, which was great. However, I bit into one of the pieces and pulled out a 4 inch piece of black hair. I proceeded to throw the rest of the pizza away. My husband called to tell them what we had found, indicating we didn't want another pizza delivered (because who would after finding hair?). Their response? An apology and then hung up. No offer of a refund or anything. Horrible! Back to Papa John's for our pizza from now on."
1,Negative,"Worst pizza ever.... I was craving some pizza and since my regular pizza joint down the street was closed... I decided to try this one out... big big mistake.

Their bait there is... 2 cheese slices and a small ( kids) drink for $ 5.99
I opted for to pay extra for one pepperoni slice and ended up paying 9 bucks....

The pizza was a big soggy doughy mess with almost no cheese or toppings.  It was about  80% dough, 10% sauce, 5% cheese and about 3 slices of pepperoni. I could barley choke it down. Ended up throwing most of it away. For having ""pizza"" in their name and that being the selling point of the place... I was very disappointed..  Never again

The restaurant was not very attractive ... mirrors were dirty, tables hadn't been cleaned, trash cans were full and dirty, and the counters along the wall were also dirty."
2,Negative,"Well, ordered pizza with black olives and pineapple. Came with black olives and pepperoni. Since I am a vegetarian that won't work. The salad was OK and cheesecake ok. Nothing special. Very sad excuse for a Streets of NY."
1,Negative,"Decided to try Fatbob's Pizza during the holiday weekend.  Pizza was very greasy, a sign that they are using cheap cheese.  Sauce on the pizza was just average, didn't have much flavor to it.  For the high prices that they charge, I expected better quality.  

Overall, I didn't like the pizza, can't recommend this place."
2,Negative,"Driest pizza we've ever had on both their gluten free & regular crusts, & we consume ALOT of pizza. Premixed 'craft' cocktails, !!! Caesar slams, we asked if it was super anchoviey, waitress 'no', reality yes.... the place looks so great & inviting, though uber disappointing."
2,Negative,I'm from Chicago so this pizza is as close to home as it gets.. but when you consistently get pizza delivered at work and home and the cheese is always sliding to one side of the pizza box tells you that they are consistent in making the same mistake over and over.. I work at a car dealer and we stopped ordering from them on Saturdays bc on a few occasions we got almost 10 or more pizzas delivered the same way I got my pizza delivered last night.. funny thing is I'm sitting at the bar having some beers while my wife and kids were at home when I got this pic. Bar service is always nice. April is awesome.. I just hate paying $30 for a thin crust and getting it delivered this way continuously ...
1,Negative,"Good: I walked in and was greeted by the entire assembly line.

Bad: Everything else. Once they did their company policy greeting, they were real punks. I'll give the young guy an exception. He kept quiet and had to deal with his coworkers longer than I had to. When we ordered, we had a coupon, then asked if we could stack another coupon. They replied with ""No. Because you're already getting like $4 off anyways."" Ok? Be more more of a smart butt next time, please. Then we ordered the pizza. We ordered a 5-meat stuffed pizza and I requested that they don't put cheddar on it, and instead use mozzarella. They were annoyed, then they took a pre made pizza, and literally scraped off the toppings with their hands right in front of us. ....yummy.


Some additional comments:

* You're a pizza place. Pizza is Italian. It's literally an Italian sin to put cheddar cheese on a pizza. Stop with the cheddar cheese, non Italian ""pizza"" makers. 

*And yes, I know how to turn the oven on. Thanks for asking and insulting my intelligence."
1,Negative,"I guess being from Chicago I am a pizza snob. I wanted this pace to be good because it 2 mins from my house however, nothing but bad cheap.pizza. When the sausage tastes like mystery meat yu know there is a problem. Nothing home made here, all out of the freezer or a box. Someone stated they had the best cheese sticks ever, really? The best frozen deep fried cheese sticks? Much better options."
2,Negative,"I thought being a privately owned pizza restaurant they'd have a good recipe. Sadly I was very disappointed. Paid $25 for a medium pizza and wings and that was with the special. The wings were in this kind of breading which was soggy and unfavorable. The pizza lacked much flavor and wasn't very good. Delivery was fairly timely, about 30 mins but then again it was also early Thursday evening. I probably won't be back. For that kind of money I'd rather go elsewhere and get more quality for my dollar."
2,Negative,"We wanted to like Luigi's.  Had been looking forward to trying it out. We felt all but forgotten while there. With small kids, we order our food fast so ordered the drinks, appetizers and pizza at once. They were out of 2 of their 5 appetizers. Appetizer came out just fine but then didn't see the waiter for 30+ minutes until he came with the dessert menu.  This is when we realized our pizza had not been made. After an hour of waiting, got our pizza and drinks refilled once (by then they were half full of water from the ice melting).  Pizza was decent but not good enough to overcome the poor service."
1,Negative,"This restaurant has relocated to the lower level at Square One.
I used to love going here, but since the move, all I can say is, ""I won't be back!""
Half the good stuff they used to carry is gone. The pasta was way better upstairs!
Really gone down hill! 
Won't be back again, ever. 
With all the new choices around the Food Court, I know where I'll be going from now on!
BTW, the pizza slice I had today, because I was with others was terrible. Cold! Instead of tomato sauce it seemed more like a marinara sauce. Awful!
(UPDATE: my daughter was sick after eating the chicken .......... Food poisoning???? Really, not good anymore!)"
1,Negative,"If you listen to 680 News I'm sure you've heard their ads on the radio talking about 50 flavours of wings and amazing pizza ... this is what brought me in.

Placed a pick up order online and when I arrived to pick up was asked what I ordered even though they had a print out of the order. I repeated my order and was told they didn't have the wing flavour ordered that they only had hot and honey garlic. For somewhere that claims 50 flavours I found it disappointing that only 2 were available and wasn't called before I showed up to let me know this wasn't available. Another item ordered they didn't have and I had to wait for my pizza to be made.

The whole experience was bad and when I got home and opened everything up realized they forgot one thing I ordered. I emailed and called (no one answered) the customer service line and have not heard back yet.

I would not recommend this place to anyone and definitely will not be ordering from here again."
2,Negative,"I would give one star but I felt our server and the pizza was great. The thing that threw us off is that we found a hair in our Brussels. We have no intention of getting over on the place but the manager said he inspected the hair and mentioned that none of the workers had that blond strand so maybe it was either my wife's, or it was flying and landed in it due to the ventilation. He didn't charge us for the dish, but he did make us feel uncomfortable like we had intention of getting over on the place, in which we didn't. I may give this place a second chance, of course with only the pizza and beer."
1,Negative,"Ordered a thin crust pizza from here last night.  Was hands down, one of the worst pizzas I have ever had.  It tasted like cardboard.  Was delivered before expected delivery time, but wasn't even close to warm.  Did I mention it tasted like cardboard?  Very disappointing."
1,Negative,Was the worst tasting pizza ever! Very bland.....The ranch was so runny I was  wondering either they let it sit out or added water to cut the cost. The place smelled like sewer and there were bugs everywhere!
2,Negative,"Way too expensive for mediocre pizza and small portioned food. Sorry, but you can spend your money elsewhere."
1,Negative,I wouldn't give this place one star if I had a choice too they are the most rude people I've ever delt with there pizzas are gross. They are very soggy dough is never fresh. I went a couple of times a week and the cook is always outside smoking cigarettes and when he goes back in doesn't even bother washing his hands before he makes my pizza. I will never eat there again in my life couple days later I had the stomach flu from eating there food I suggest you do not eat there at all.
2,Negative,"I have mixed reviews of this place. It's obviously run by kids off for the summer and or a part time job because every time I call I get a prompt answer and half way through my order the person says ""hold on"" a bunch of laughing, then I have to repeat my order. The slotted time for delivery is ALWAYS 45min - 1hr. Today, it arrived within 20 min and the pizza was not cooked thoroughly. The top was fine, the rest was spongy and like wet! 

  Just know what to expect when calling and don't do anything while waiting because it could show up 20-40 min early."
1,Negative,"Can not justify a frozen crust gluten pizza the size of a plate for $16.90 ridiculous! It scary to eat here. 
To top it all off, pizza was burnt. Beyond chard. 
I don't mind paying higher prices but quality has to meet price. 
Ridiculous!"
1,Negative,Waited an hour for the food to come. When it arrived it looked like it was sitting in the drivers trunk for two days. Medium pizza and couldn't stomach a single slice. My girlfriend and I are now out $30 and still hungry. Check your pizza before you pay.. really.
1,Negative,"Their tag line, "" better ingredients, better pizza, Papa John's"", should be changed to "" better pizza, horrible service where the manager hangs up on you, Papa John's""! I was sent an email with a special discount. I followed the link and ordered a pizza for delivery. Like I've done a dozen times before. I'm sure they drivers remember me, I tip well. The promised time of 19-29 minutes seemed great. Ordered at 7:23pm. At 8:20 pm I called to ask about my food. I was placed on hold immediately. 4-5 minutes. The girl finally picked up and I asked about my dinner, gave my name and address.. she seemed confused. She said the address they had for my order was next door to them and they cancelled it. I asked ""why didn't you call me? you have my number."" She couldn't answer, but said she would get a manager. The manager, no name offered, came to the phone after a solid 4 minutes. (This call is now 10 minutes long). In a nut shell he said they thought it was a prank call and cancelled it.  I gave him my address, name and even offered my customer number from the web order. He didn't care. He was equally silent when I asked why didn't he call me to confirm the address? He responded with blaming me for the mix up and HANGING UP ON ME! No apologies,no offer to correct the error. He just hung up. This is not the first time I've had issues with this store. It will be the last. There are 3 other pizza places in the immediate area, they now get my business and money. Good bye Papa."
2,Negative,"Service was great but ,The wait was very long and when we finally got our pizza it was just another mediocre pizza. I would understand if the place was busy but at that time there were two other couples there and already eating! I was very disappointed."
2,Negative,Really like the concept but they sure skimp on the toppings if you get anything other then red sauce and mozzarella. I'll add a pic of my pizza that had large bubbles in it do to the lack of toppings.
1,Negative,"Wanna hear a riddle? Ever notice how every one who eats at guys is drunk? 

You give? Because had they been sober they would notice the blend taste of cardboard overwhelming their delectable palates. It s passable at best. But recently they've outdone themselves. I somehow managed to get ill eating that stuff. I ve never gotten food poisoning from pizza before. This was a first."
1,Negative,"Only had 1 person inside waiting on ppl and at the bar. Was there for 20 mins and no one came to take my order, when all I wanted was a slice of pizza to go (that was already made). 

Terrible service."
1,Negative,"Terrible pizza extremely disappointing especially from a James Beard Chef. The Forager was so greasy and under seasoned. Wonderful ingredients however poor execution, not impressed at all. Will stick to Settebello at least the pizza is seasoned and good!! The bread sticks are a palate killer and ruin your taste buds loaded with grease and spice. Little over priced in my opinion after 2 glasses of wine, beet salad, cheese and charcuterie $100 plus tip, the food and the service were both bland. Step it up we expect more out of a James Beard Chef, especially because Sage is incredible."
2,Negative,"Ugh.  I used to love Papa Johns but this location does not do it justice.  

We have ordered the buffalo chicken pizza in the past when it was first introduced here.  The base is ranch sauce with sliced chicken strips, bacon, onion, cheese and topped with a swirl of buffalo sauce.  Our Buffalo chicken pizza arrived with no buffalo drizzle on top.  Wouldn't they know this is probably the main ingredient which makes it a 'Buffalo' chicken pizza? 

I called to let them know and the manager apologized.  Decided to give them a second chance.  I told them what happened last time.  Again, received the pizza with no buffalo drizzle on top. Seriously?? Even after a phone call to order instead of my normal online ordering they still managed to make this incorrectly.  

Big Fail."
2,Negative,"Pizza review only!!!

1) Their beer tastes good
2) Their entres look like stuff you'd find anywhere else and at least smelled and looked good
3) The place looks nice

BUT...the pizza claiming to be ""Authentic Chicago Deep Dish""...sucks...think Personal Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut...remember the doughy texture, the flavor, the look, etc...then you've eaten Old Chicago's deep sigh...just a waste...AND the personal pan (which the waitress said she 'split' with her friends cuz it was sooooooo much ran me almost $13 and barely filled me up.

However, I would go back to try their other offerings...if I have time."
2,Negative,"My boyfriend and I came to Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza after a terrible experience at Cadillac ranch-which resulted in only one of us getting a drink(mine was ""forgotten"" about as they changed the tap) and no food. So we were rather hungry at this point and made our way to Anthony's about 30 minutes before they closed.To start, their drinks are insanely expensive for a quick bite after a movie-which was all this was supposed to be. However, my frustration from Cadillac got the best of me and I settled on a glass of wine-for $11.00. My boyfriend got a Yuengling which was considerably more reasonably priced.After reviewing the menu, we decided we wanted to make a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, and olives. Unfortunately, after ordering our server-who was incredibly warm,helpful, and attentive -came back and told us they were out of the prosciutto so we settled for pepperoni. The pizza, of course, was ""well done"" around the edges, however, the center was considerably underdone. The flavors were great and the pizza would have been excellent had it not been for the undercooked center. Overall, we will probably not be back-we had a total of 3 drinks (1 glass of wine,2 yuenglings) and the pizza and our bill was pushing $60.00 which is more than we had originally expected to spend for a quick bite to eat after a movie.And, as I said before, the pizza, although the flavors were good was undercooked in the center-which did not ruin the pizza entirely but came close to it. I do not feel the need to revisit this establishment."
2,Negative,"My review is a bit overdue seeing as how we actually ordered from Naked Pizza a few weeks ago.

Had some friends over for game 7 of the NBA finals and had been wanting to try out this place. So we called in an order and brought it back. We ordered the Mediterranean, the Farmvil and a plain cheese pizza. We weren't given a crust option so thin is what we got, paper thin.

The ingredients were all really good quality. But the sauce didn't really stand out, and to me, that's the most crucial ingredient.

There's really nothing else in the immediate area to compete with Naked Pizza, business-wise, but I don't really think this place will be a huge success. I'll probably give it another go sometime down the line, but a couple nights ago I opted to drive a little bit out of the way for a better pie, and better value. It's a bit overpriced for what you're getting."
1,Negative,Ordered the calamari and a buffalo chicken pizza with no onions and paid an extra fee for a side of ranch. The calamari was so over cooked that I couldn't chew through it and the pizza had a lot of onions... and they forgot our ranch. Not worth the $44. And don't say you have coke products if you carry pepsi ...
1,Negative,"I do not recommend ever ordering delivery from this location. I decided to give them another chance because the first time I ordered it was football Sunday, took over 2 hours to receive my pizza and it was delivered cold. This time, I was estimated a 28-38 min delivery time. I placed my order at 6:07. It was taken out of the oven at 6:25. I didn't receive my order until 7:25. I called the location right before it arrived and they assured me it would be warm because they keep it under a heating lamp. I have worked in a pizza place. A pizza does not hold up for half a hour under a heating lamp and half a hour in a bag out for delivery. The manager, Sandra, is equally as rude and refused to do anything about the experience. I have complained to corporate and they can't do anything because this is a privately owned business. If you want pizza, you are better off going across the street and getting one from Little Caesars."
1,Negative,Ordered for carry out and we were overcharged.  We were told we needed a coupon.  Don't trust their invoices. Go elsewhere.  The pizza will be better too.
2,Negative,"This is for the pizza to go portion of the restaurant.

The pizzas are supposed to be a quick gourmet pizza, so don't expect to find your typical toppings aside from just pepperoni. There were maybe 4-5 options. The pizzas themselves were just meh. The crust was not that thin and crunchy. For a better late night pizza, secret pizza at the Cosmo is a much better option. Also, the line moves sooo slow."
1,Negative,"If I could give negative stars,  I WOULD!! This was the WORST pizza and wings I've ever had! The pizza dough was still raw and the wings burnt bones... So disappointing!"
1,Negative,"I have visited this Pizza Hut a few times but my last experience pushed me over the edge. I stopped in for lunch-they offer a buffet. $5.99 for all you can eat pasta, pizza, and breadsticks along with one side salad. It's actually a good deal IF, and that's a big if, there is pizza available. 
As mentioned before I have been to this location multiple times for lunch and each time has gotten worse. It is not uncommon for all pizza, pasta, and breadsticks to be gone on the buffet. The employees should know there is going to rush at lunch time and plan accordingly. Not sure if they need to prepare more pizza in advance and keep it warm or have more staff to make pizza for the buffet and other orders but improvements are needed. 
Moving onto the staff, these employees are some of the worst I have ever seen. Drinks are not refilled, plates are not cleared, and checks are not brought. I had to walk to the counter to request more water as well as request my bill. It is not uncommon for tables to remain dirty/piled with plates until there is no other seating available and the staff is forced to clean. 
Long and short this Pizza Hut has a lot to improve on. I would highly recommend avoiding them during lunch."
1,Negative,"Never again! What a waste of money! My son graduated from high school and we decided to celebrate at Dave & Buster. Making the plans was great with the manager, Laura; and I figured it was going to be a great place to celebrate my first born's accomplishment. Our package included food and game cards for everyone; as well as a sectioned off corner of the place. At first, the man that greeted me was really nice; but when I went to give him complain about the food being cold- he completely changed. Mind you, everyone is traveling from out of town. Everyone is hungry and ready to eat. The fries were cold and nasty; chicken bites cold; pizza bites cold; Mac and cheese cold..and the soda pitchers all contained watered down soda. I asked him when was the food set out and he said it was set out 6-10 minutes before we arrived. Lies. So he replaced some of the items. When I went to pay, I told him I will not be paying the entire ""suggested tip""; as I was not very happy with the service and his attitude and once again, he proceeded to give me an attitude telling me about all the discounts he had given me due to my complaint. Excuse me? There's no discount in the world that could fix the way he was talking to me and their nasty, cold food! So, the next day or so, I emailed Laura; who apologized to me and said she would get back to me within a day or two of talking to the host. Three weeks have past and Laura has not gotten back to me. Case closed. Never again."
2,Negative,"I'd give the food an A+

The price of the food for the quality and quantity you get is amazing.

Bad parts, it's insanely loud in this place.  Not sure if it has to do with the layout or what.  Not crazy about the bar being in the same room as the eating area.  

Service was good but also chaotic and was overcharged.

The menu is ok, seems they are pushing salads and pizza more then entrees.  They could use 3-5 more pasta dishes and some kind of beef dish.

This place is for sure for the younger crowd, which could be good and bad.  

I'd probably hit this place up once a month just for the food.

Their beer and wine selection pretty much sucks, hopefully they can expand it."
1,Negative,"Try harding at it's best. 17th ave (and Calgary on the whole) is being flooded with ""monkey see monkey do"" restaurants. This one is not an exception. Great location, great space...except for the fact that there is ALWAYS a lineup for the washroom. 

Staff there (this summer - July) did not know the menu, and two of the pizza's we ordered were EXACTLY THE SAME LESS 1 INGREDIENT. I think that's a little weak for a new menu.....

Anyway. They tried to fix the situation, which was nice. 

For eating in a parking lot surrounded by boards off of 17th ave..ambience outside get's a 3/10..the rest.....just not original or well executed. 

Disappointed because it looked to have potential."
1,Negative,"Nellos Ahwatukee,
Stopped in after a hard day, and got a pizza to go.
One of the most tasteless pizzas I have eaten, (ate only one slice).
Asked my wife how hers was, she said eh.
Have eaten here before. As I recall, it was much better. 
I could've gotten more flovor from Dominos, or Pizza Hut, although the flavors not good, at least, you got flavor.
Noticed alot of people got various toppings, I didn't.
I think if you get a good pizza,it should taste good plain, to start with, then add toppings. If it dosen't, the pizza's goin to be mediocre at best.
Try Florencias on Ray Rd. much much better, regardless of toppings."
2,Negative,"Atmosphere is great,  love the open ceilings, covered outdoor seating and the decor is interesting. The food however fell short, I don't understand the hype. The hand cut fries are far from the best, Boardwalk Fries, Smash Buger, Five Guys, etc. all has them beat.  They remind me of trying to make them at home with the wrong equipment, flavorless. Their famous sandwiches also fell short of flavor,  way to much starch when they combine their thick Italian bread and the fries pilled on top your choice of meat. I had the favorite Pitts-burger and was very disappointed, no flavor, the meat was mush and topped with the fries it was gross. The pizza however was good."
1,Negative,"While the pizza is decent, the service is not so good. Being told it would be 45 minutes for a pick up order is fine. However, after showing up at about 40 minutes and paying then being told it would still be a few minutes and nothing even 15 minutes later, patience is over. Then after asking how much longer and come to find out our pizza has been sitting on top of the oven since walking in, is just NOT right!! Then after pointing out that we have been waiting an extra 15 minutes for no reason, there was no apology, just "" sorry I didn't see it"". Totally unexceptable! Will never go back. There are plenty of other choices in the area. Not worth my time as clearly they could care less about my time and their mistake!!"
1,Negative,"I was in town for the weekend and decided to have a quick dinner with my family. I love Pizza Hut, like love, love them. This one was terrible. The sauce tasted funny and the crust was kind of chewy. This did not even compare to the bad service.

I made an online order and did not receive a call to confirm my order so I called them. They confirmed my order. My husband went to go pick it up. When I got up to get mine I noticed that both pizzas were the same. I called the store and spoke to a manager, she was kind of condesending and made me feel like I was lying. I asked to have the replacement delivered since it was just down the street. She wanted to give me credit and I said no because I don't even live there. She told me it would take 40 mins for it to be delivered and that she would call when it was on it's way. 

By then it was already getting late and I was starting to fall asleep. 45 mins passed and there was no call. I was about to call back when I finally got a knock on the door. The driver told me I had a balance due and I said, ""Nooooo..."" He said oh, you paid online? I said yes. So he said there wasn't a signature line and he had to get my signature. Then he said, that's funny, there's no delivery charge. I said I hope not. He then asked me if they messed up on my previous order and I said yes, I got the wrong pizza. Then he really pissed me off because he's still holding the pizza and annoyingly says, ""Well I wish they would've told me this was a freebie!"" Why would they tell you that? Does it matter? Do you do something special to it like spit on it before it gets there because it's free? 

So rude from beginning to end."
1,Negative,"Dominos had a deal for $6 medium pizza, which I thought was a good deal and you get two toppings. Went to pick it up and they should have just said $6 small pizza, the box was a small. It serve probably 3 people if they all had 3 pizza each. When I went to pick it up the guy was on his cellphone, but don't worry he was nice enough to put his phone down when I came in. Not worth the savings."
1,Negative,"The service was mediocre at best, and unfriendly. The pizza is far from famous. I ordered a slice of pepperoni to go and my order was placed on a paper plates and the placed in a paper bag with no other covering. By the time I drove 2 mikes back to my destination it was cold and tasted as if it were previously frozen.. Will not be returning here..."
1,Negative,"FYI: Their pizza ""patio"" is NOT dog or even kid friendly. After we sat down outside and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back out to tell us that the dogs were only allowed to be tied up on the outside of the patio. She also added that kids weren't allowed on the patio either. There were no signs saying any of these rules posted inside or outside at the patio. If you're looking for a nice outdoor patio to bring your kids or furry friend and enjoy a nice drink or meal...this isn't the place."
2,Negative,"Edible but nothing to rave about.
Really, were some of you guys drunk as fuck when you ate this or published reviews?  I was expecting a delicious white spinach pizza...but noooo just cheap cheap below average pizza. 3$ a slice of white spinach."
2,Negative,"I feel sorry for your arizonans, who while having an enormous amount of places to eat at, have to settle for such mediocrity.  Here in LA these restaurants wouldn't stand a chance of staying in business for this reason.

Visiting friends recommended this place as ""great"" and so we had take out, which in all fairness does affect food quality.  But this is pizza, probably the best takeout food one can order.  Ordered the BLT pizza and it was a monstrosity.  Picture bacon on a sauceless pie, with a side order of shredded lettuce and tomatoes with a ramekin of mayonaise on the side!

That is exactly what this dish is.  Disgusting!  Whoever in their right mind thought mayonaise on a pizza was a good idea needs their head examined.

Also ordered the strawberry and gongonzola salad which was edible, just not great.  Prices were the best part of this place, a bad attempt at knocking off CPK(which I wish we went to).  Calories are too precious to be wasted on bad or mediocre food.  Avoid this place if you agree....."
1,Negative,"I'm here on a Wednesday afternoon, 2 pmish. I should always trust my gut instinct, but I didn't! Dumb on my part. I always like to sit at the bar. As soon as I got near the bar, it hit me. You know, that smell! The nasty smell that tells you the bar isn't cleaned well. Stale, old beer smell! Ughhhhh
Sure enough, the bar, my chair are sticky. Disgusting. The stainless steel coolers, sinks, counter tops should be shiny & clean. You can see sitting at the bar, the grime on them! 
Bartender is very nice & friendly! I ordered lobster pizza and lobster bisque. The pizza is ok, but the lobster bisque is awful. Bland, tasteless, no texture (so I'm not sure if there is even pieces of lobster in it?). I even grabbed Saltine crackers to put in it, but guess what? Crackers are stale? Newks ( a sandwich chain) has incredible lobster bisque and they are a deli! Great taste, texture, pieces of lobster in it, yet this is a seafood restaurant serving this microwaved canned tasting bisque? 
Corporate has to do something about this Red Lobster! It's in a heavy traffic location , but is a very very poor restaurant! I never understand why any restaurant GM is ok with a dirty bar area, with a nasty smell? Must be he/she just doesn't care? And if anyone from corporate stepped in here and is ok with this condition, then shame on you! It has to be about more than profits & the bottom line! 
Lastly, Red Lobster, you can brush aside my review and say ""whatever"" and it's just a pissed off customer! Or you can take feedback and do something about it? The ""balls in your court!"""
2,Negative,"It was my Friend's birthday this Saturday and her husband arranged a private group event for 3-D Dodgeball.

 I was really excited because it was something new that I have not tried.  However, there is always good  and BAD!

The GOOD, we got what we came for...Trampolines. We booked an hour session for 7:00pm to 8:00pm. Our session included pizza and pop in the skybar as part of our package. The trampolines was fun because we had 24 people in our group (no matter how bad the situation, good company makes everything). We had a 3-D dodgeball court to ourselves (20 minutes, instead of an hour). 

Well, we have more BAD than good. The staff was unorganized and rude! They cut our session short and blamed us for being late when we arrived at 6:30pm. They won't own up to their mistake because all they see is the orange sticker with session time. If we knew, they were unorganized, we would come an hour early. We even had all our friends do an online waiver prior to arriving to speed the process. We didn't get onto the court till 7:30pm because we were waiting for staff to give us an orientation and another group was on the court that we've booked. We had to explain to multiple staff to get our hour session when they cut us off at 20 minutes and told us to go to the open court with no dodgeball. We had a team member to monitor our group to ourselves but he kept on disappearing and other team members was saying our time was up and we had to move to another court. We were wasting our time transitioning from one court to another more than once because staff said we shouldn't be here. At that moment, we were all all annoyed.

The food was just like Chuck E Cheese. We got pizza and pop (coke, sprite, and ice tea). The pizza overall was good, however the pop was water down. 
The decor needs improvements because it looked tired and dull. Not a nice place for nonparticipants (parents, friends, and children) to sit around. The skybar smells like B.O. and there was no air conditioning. The parking lot had tons of pot holes. The washroom was smelly and dirty (no place to change). 

This is a sweaty sport, so we brought a change of clean clothes but went straight home to shower because we couldn't bear to change in the bathroom. 

Surprisingly, trampoline was exhausting!"
1,Negative,This once great pizza has gone downhill to a point where they might as well close this last one up.  I am writing this while my insides are  in great distress after eating one of their pizzas.  Never again will I be so stupid to eat from there again.
2,Negative,"I almost feel bad for leaving two stars because the staff were very friendly, however the whole experience was a little underwhelming. And let me section it into groups to make this review easier to find what you're looking for.

Food:
My boyfriend and I got the penne al vodka and the pizza al cazone to share. 
The pasta (penne al vodka) honestly tasted like every other pasta i've had and made, it was quite plain and lacked flavour, colour, texture, etc. It didn't taste bad but i have no reason to want to come back for it. 
The pizza was more on the underwhelming side but maybe I'm not a pizza master so I shouldn't judge on quality. All i know is the crust was flat, the sauce was plain, the cheese concentrated a lot in the center leaving the outer half naked with sauce. I honestly don't know what was supposed to be on this pizza because it came out looking like your regular cheese pizza. 

Cost:
These meals are a little under $20, that's like pickle barrel money. Except the taste is far from pickle barrel. That's all I have to say.

Venue:
If I could redecorate, I would.

Experience:
Aight, so when we walked in first thing was the waitress seemed like she didn't know where to seat us, I've never been a waitress I don't know how restaurants work when it comes to seating so I won't judge too much. When we were seated we were given menus (and this is the part where waitresses get us started on drinks so we have something to sip on while we browse) but she just left. By the time we were ready to order, she came back but only asked for drinks. She gave us our waters and some garlic bread which was kind of her, but then walked away again. After we ordered, my boyfriend and I just talked but we sat at a table that was able to look into the kitchen. WE SAW WHEN OUR FOOD WAS READY AND WE JUST WATCHED IT GET COLD FROM A DISTANCE. When the food got to us it was luke warm. We were offered cheese and pepper for the pasta. The pepper was grinded, the cheese was in a mason jar for us to pour ourselves and so thats cool, bUT ANOTHER WAITRESS HAD TO COME LATER and she was like ""sorry im going to steal your cheese"". I'm not mad at her but i'm just?? why dont you guys just separate your cheese in small dishes or something. 

Feed back for the restaurant:
I've noticed that you guys have a lot of items on your menu and its good to have variety BUT you could really benefit from removing the quantity of dishes and focus on improving the quality of these dishes. It's better to have 3 great dishes that you've mastered well and that your customers are going to love coming back for rather than saying ""hey we have so many choices"" because looking at all of them i dont know where to start. Also seperate your cheese or handle the cheese like you handle the pepper."
1,Negative,"I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.

Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!"
1,Negative,"So I was craving sushi pizza yesterday.

Just really wanted some.

Since my friend lives near this sushi restaurant, and we were at the Starbucks just down the street.  I got a salmon sushi pizza to go.  I decided to call them, and they told me to pick it up in 10 minutes.

Was not very impressed.  1) the salmon was not that fresh; 2) the description was: salmon, spicy sauce, onion, green onion, unagi sauce (what onion and green onions?! I didn't see it!); and 3) the salmon was strangely warm by the time I got it.

Maybe I'll try going for dinner next time... Should I try my chances?"
1,Negative,I had a 14' pepperoni pizza and The best way I could described what the pizza tasted like was little caesars pizza. Wasn't pleasant...
1,Negative,"The slice of pizza was good. The service by General Manager Vincent was horrible! The location is inside the Linq, potential for better business. But the restaurant was empty and quiet. Vincent was rude and unprofessional. No wonder why they did not have any clients dining in and even the staff looked unhappy. I wanted to dine in but unfortunately we were denied service for a party of four because I had my smoothie drink that had piña colada but because it was an outside drink we were not allowed? Hello - we are in Vegas, everyone is walking around with a drink. Besides the point, the outcome would have been a positive one if Vincent wasn't RUDE! I asked if he was the owner and he said he was it, WOW he should go to Business school to first obtain an education on service and then know how to run a successful business."
1,Negative,Terrible customer service. Ordered pizza took two hours for it to be delivered. Ordered a pizza with various vegetables and found a single piece of pepperoni in it. Which we do not eat. Unless you are a desperate college student looking for food late into the night I would not recommend ordering from them.
2,Negative,"Sorry Papa. My pizza was kinda bland, nothing really special about it. Instead of the Supreme maybe next time (if there is one) I'll try one of those specialty pizzas."
1,Negative,"I ordered the gluten free pizza for delivery... After twice the wait time I was told to expect my delivery, my pizza arrived barely topped cold and hard as a rock. When I called, to question the reasoning behind the problems with my food, I was placed on hold, then the young lady that answered the phone said ""since I had the food, they would not refund my purchase."" This must be the worst service I've received by delivery, and the most absurd response from a manager I've heard."
1,Negative,"The pizza was absolutely terrible, the sauce bland, the crust was like thick cardboard and the employees were truly terrible to deal with. 
Spend your money elsewhere, you'll be glad you did."
2,Negative,"We choose this place over the many other pizza options in the area and boy that was a mistake....  I ordered a calzone to share and it was a large portion but the dough was raw and soggy! I asked if it at ricotta cheese and was told yes, and when I got it home I found out there was none. This was upsetting to me because I would have paid the extra for the ricotta had I just been told correctly.  I did order the garlic knots as well and they were okay, a little bland but not the worst I have had. All in all I will not return to this establishment not when  there is so many choices in the area."
2,Negative,"This place was great when it was called Mark Rich's NY Pizza.  The new place has gone way downhill.  I used to love their pizza, but now it's way below average.  I used to drive miles out of my way to eat here, but no more.  It's just not the same.  The staff changed and I guess they changed cooks."
2,Negative,"I'm not really a big fan of the ""new"" Dominos pizza. I think this is a case of old Coke and new Coke. Remember back in the day, Coke changed it's formula to be more syrupy tasting, similar to Pepsi? Then they decided it was a big mistake and went back to ""Coke Classic."" I think same thing here applies. I had Dominos ""new"" taste today and didn't really care for the change. Behind Peter Piper Pizza, Dominos has been my 2nd favorite of the pizza chains. I liked the old taste, and I think they should bring it back. They can call it ""Dominos Classic.""

I'm not saying I don't like the new pizza, I kind of like that strong garlic flavor to the crust. But I liked the taste of the old crust better. I never thought the old pizza tasted like ""cardboard"" like I've heard some people complain about. I think Dominos may have overreacted here to slumping sales."
2,Negative,"Live right by Danny Boys and we finally decided to try it. Honestly, the last year I've lived here I thought it was a cabaret of some sort. Not a very attractive looking restaurant from the outside. The interior of the restaurant was such a pleasant surprise. Very clean and had a great welcoming feel. 
Unfortunately, the service was slow and the food was nothing great. I ordered a melt and it was oily and nothing to brag about. The pizza we ordered was also subpar. I wanted to ask for a side of sauce because it lacked flavor. I will say the flies were yummy, but I mean that's a given. 
On a last note, the menu is outrageously large. Too many items in my opinion. Made it hard to decide and I feel like much if it was just over kill. Overall, wasn't too impressed with the service or food, but I would come back for the bar, it had a cool, relaxed atmosphere."
2,Negative,"We love this pizza.  Went there today and ordered a Soho salad pizza. It was ordered with no tomatoes or almonds. It was brought out with almonds and tomatoes by a gentleman we later learned was the manager. We expressed to him that we had asked for no almonds or tomatoes and apologized and took it back.  The Soho comes back with our waitress with tomatoes. We again expressed to her that we did not want tomatoes and she says she will get the manager and leaves it on the table.  Several minutes go by and the manager came out and apologized and said he had a large catering order on the phone and neglected to tell the kitchen no tomatoes.  He took it back and a short time it came out for the third time correctly.  Considering all the issues one would have expected the Soho to be comp'd. When we got the bill it was still on there.  We paid the bill and expressed to the waitress that it was disappointing that we were still charged for the Soho when it took 3 times to get it correct.  She told us that she thought the manager would have taken it off but he didn't and she apologized. The whole point of having dinner together is to eat together.  Because of the issues this didn't happen as my pizza would have been cold.  

Bummer experience all around.  

Returned today for take out.  Pizza was good and made just like we ordered.  We are very satisfied with this visit and the excellent food!!!"
1,Negative,"One star for now. Wanted pizza by the slice, as advertised on their website, menu, and neon sign. Don't sell it on weekends."
2,Negative,"Took a while to get the pizza, they don't have breadsticks, the pizza was over cooked just a little bit, the service was pretty good as the employees were nice, way over priced for what you get!  4 sodas, a 12 inch cheese pizza, a 12 inch pizza with pepperoni on one half and a few meats on the other half and 1 cannoli was $48 without tip."
1,Negative,"Over saturated pizza had to be consumed with a knife and fork. Limp and overloaded... Absolutely impossible to handle, a sure sign the crust and proportion of toppings was all wrong. At $10 a slice it needs to be perfect. Just like the over-engineered Aria hotel where it is located, everything is massive overkill. Sometimes less is more."
2,Negative,"Used to like Barro's but this location has turned me off.  The pizza is just okay, service has been consistently bad, and good luck finding a napkin or condiment."
1,Negative,On February 18 about 11:30am I stopped by for a slice of pizza with sausage and canadian bacon toppings.  In the middle of the night I woke up vomiting and diarrhea.  One slice of pizza  gave me food poisoning.
1,Negative,"What a disappointment. It's not the first time I order from here but it will be the last. I don't know if they changed the owner or chef but the pizza was such a let down. The first time I tried their pizza, their tomato was amazing. There was a certain spice that they used that left you craving another piece. This time was completely different. There was barely any sauce on the pizza and the dough seemed to have been raw. It was chewy and sat on your stomach. It's a huge disappointment especially when you were craving their pizza and finally cave and have one bite and throw it away. A waste of calories."
1,Negative,One if the worst ran places ever management is lost in what they need to do. It seems like they don't know what they are doing. Took one hour to get two small pizza's. This place is a joke. Do waste your time.
2,Negative,"If a Yelp review could be two words, it would be ""underwhelming & disappointing.""  Black parts on the soggy wilted salad and I would love to see the bag their ""cheese"" comes out of.   As a Chicagoan, I will encourage you to seek your Chicago pizza fix elsewhere.  The only silver lining is that the gals at the counter we're very attentive and friendly."
1,Negative,This was just plain bad.  It had a really overly thick crust with a thin layer of cheese and sauce.  It tasted like school lunch pizza from high school in the 80's.  The sausage also tasted cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this place.
2,Negative,"* Overpriced, but that is to be expected for their location.
* The water tasted gross. I get that it is tap water.. but everywhere has tap water and it does not taste that way.
* There is only one men's restroom and one women's restroom. That is not enough for the size of this place... especially when the food is overpriced, I do not want to wait for a restroom!
* My husband had the CALABRESE pizza. The toppings were sparse. Their was little sauce on the pizza. The crust was dark and had a burnt taste.
* I had the meatballs. They were bland and you could tell they had huge croutons in them. The sauce they were in was thin and greasy. I tried adding my meatballs and sauce to a slice of my husbands pizza and it still didn't taste good!
* I did not like the green sauce they seemed to put on everything. 
* The Caesar salad was fresh, but $12.
* The service was good.

They definitely get business because of their location, not because of the food! There are so many better places in Las Vegas!"
1,Negative,"I will begin by saying this was my worst dining experience in as long as I can remember. Since I am from NY, I have had pizza experiences galore. However, any human needing to eat needs to avoid this place.
First of all, there was no staff- just one young lady attempting to do about 4 jobs. This place needs proper staffing in a big way. She was the cashier, bartender, waiter, etc. 
We ordered a large pizza with 2 toppings, well done. It arrived, not well done, WITHOUT sauce!!!!!!!!!!. The most tasteless, dryest, horrible pie I ever had!!!!!
Please avoid this place at all costs."
1,Negative,"Oh man ... this is NOT good pizza ... it's CHEAP and they usually have an all you can eat lunch buffet but the 'za is about as good as Little Caesar's Pizza (i.e. ""not so much"")"
2,Negative,"I don't normally write reviews however I just spent $8.00 on a greasy, warm(not hot) piece of pizza and a salad (that went straight to the trash it was so awful). Save your money I would rather have a Little Caesar pizza then eat at Rays again."
2,Negative,Food is good and I dont mine waiting awhile for delivery. But we got the wrong pizza (which it happens) I called and they said the would switch the pizzas out. So delivery man came back and we swaped pizzas. I was reassured that mine was in the delivery car the whole time. I know they gave the pizza I had in my house that I opened to someone else. I lost my trust in them. I know I am a clean person and did not touch the pizza it self. But what if I did something to it? You dont know now days.  Should be once out of the sight of the driver you cant give it to anyone else. Then I cant get their contact page to work on the web sight. Will give them a call tomorrow.
1,Negative,"This place is a mess.  Called on Saturday evening 6:20 PM.  10 minutes on hold, hung up.  Called back and ordered 2 pizzas.  At 8:00 no pizza so a I called back, manager tells me they see that I ordered, but whoever took the order didn't hit the send button.  Uhhh, ok.  Puts me on hold, after 10 minutes I hang up.  I call back, no apology, but took the order again and said they'd rush it out in 25 minutes.  An hour later no pizza, I call back.  They have no record of my order.  Manager doesn't know who I am.  I tell him what happened and that I had talked to the manager, he tells me they have different manager.  He asks if I want to reorder, I can tell that this is actually the manager and he does apologize.  No pizza that night.  I've ordered from this place dozens of times over the years and never had a problem, but something has changed."
2,Negative,"Pizza was ok. Service was not so great. If you like attentive service and good pizza for a good price, don't come here....go to spinattos! I ordered a spinach pie, and could count on one hand how much spinach was in it. Garlic bread had no garlic. Crust is decent but has no taste.  One last thing...dont order the antipasto salad. 16 dollars for a big bowl of nothing. We won't be coming back."
1,Negative,"Ordered a couple pizzas and a bottle of water for delivery from the McKnight Rd Pizza Hut. My husband paid in cash and when he came inside I saw that we didn't get the bottle of water and the pizza didn't have all the ingredients on it that we asked for. When I called to have it fixed, some Pizza Hut operator told me that he couldn't get the McKnight store to pick up the phone and that more often then not they stop answering after 9PM because they don't want any more orders because the store closes at 10PM. That's fine except I wasn't placing a new order I was just trying to get the order that I already paid for! He told me I should try to call back the next day. Seriously? Ridiculous."
1,Negative,"Without bashing the entire franchise, Giordano's is a great pizza stop on the south side of chicago. Growing up 10 minutes away from the original location means you spend a lot of time there. Since moving to arizona less than a year ago, I was excited to see Giordano's had made its way west. After trying their pizza 3 times, it proves me right that any pizza here is incomparable to chicago and it's somewhat embarrassing to the original locations. Nothing tastes the same and it's always a long wait just to be disappointed in the product. Apparently, if I want good pizza i'm going to have to go back home for that."
1,Negative,"They messed up the first pizza, no cheese on one side  (how that happens is beyond me). So we waited for a replacement which was even worse,  barely any sauce and less cheese than the first one.  They did give us both pizzas for the price of one else, but it should have been free."
1,Negative,"Please beware, this is not Italian food.  I ordered a fish special from the chalk board that claimed to come with spinach risotto.   The fish had a terrible taste and the risotto was uncle bens rice with some spinach tossed in.  I love risotto and it is supposed to be made from short grained arborio rice and should be creamy and served al dente.  This long grained rice was boiled to the point of being overcooked and simply slapped on my $29 plate.  The  more I think about it the angrier I get. 

The Mediterranean pizza was closer to but not as good as pizza pizza rather the an authentic Italian pie.  

This restaurant may draw tourists and unwitting torontonians who don't know better, but I would not go back to an Italian restaurant that doesn't know what risotto is."
2,Negative,"Certainly cannot agree with the 4+5 star reviews ot this place, since it may be the most expensive pizza restaurant in Las Vegas. We ordered the Gotham Pizza, which is ""supposed"" to include pepperone, sausage & salami, but there was ZERO salami, & only a smattering of sausage. Perhaps a dozen circles of pepperoni. Lots of cheese if that pleases you? For $28 I think customers should expect something ""better"". Onions? Peppers? Olives? Mushrooms?  However, anything above the minimal serving of meat, would push the price well above $30, since each ingredient adds another $2. For those who want to spend $30-40++ on a 16"" pizza, I wish them well. For us -- we go to Wolfgang Puck's in the Crystal Shopping Mall attached to ARIA, & get a better pizza for 1/2 the price."
2,Negative,"I'll give a rating of OK.  I have been there twice.  The first time I didn't like it at all.  The pizza was too burnt.  All their pizza ends up a little burnt, but this one was overly burnt.  The wings were also flavorless and terrible.

The second time I went was for someones birthday.  I kind of went kicking and screaming, but this time the pizza was a lot better, but still not as good as you can get a lot of other places, and it's quite expensive compared to other pizza places.  It's not really terrible pizza, but for the big bucks they charge, go somewhere with better pizza.  

So all that being said, would I go there by choice?  No.  Would I be ok going back if I had to, yeah."
1,Negative,"Great food, but had a terrible large group experience. Last year we had our staff Christmas party at Cibo and had such a good experience that we decided to book at Cibo again this year. We had about 35 guests and did the family-style dinner. Wow, were we surprised when we each received HALF the quantity of food compared to last year and each paid fully TWICE the price as last year!! Unbelievable!! Last year we each paid $40 each (includes gratuity, etc.) and this year we each paid OVER $80 EACH. Seriously, Cibo... who do you guys think you are??  Teatro? Ceasars Steackhouse? Ruth's Chris?  You guys serve pizza and fancy pasta... Albeit very good pizza and pasta. So we will definitely NOT be having our staff party there next year. Too bad, because they are a great restaurant with great food and atmosphere. Hopefully they can make some changes."
2,Negative,"Meh. I was so excited to go because the brunch buffet is touted as one of the best in CLT. Not impressed.

Scrambled eggs were dry. Flatbread pizzas were cold. Sausage links were rubbery. Orange juice wasn't freshly-squeezed.

The brewery is spacious and lively and our waitress was great, but the food was truly a disappointment."
1,Negative,"I ordered from this store online and they screwed up my order. I called and spoke to manager Mike and he hung up on me because I wanted a refund instead of a credit. I called back and he admitted he hung up on me and said ""the conversation was over."" He's not management material and what good is a pizza store that can't make an order correctly?"
2,Negative,"Unfortunately, what is otherwise good Pizza is marred by a terrible ordering and customer service experience. This institution frequently quotes 40 minutes for take out pizza and over the course of three visits the food has never been ready at that time. It is clear that they quote an early time for no good reason. I should not have to add a fifteen minute buffer window and risk my pizza being cold."
1,Negative,"Order my pizza online and waited for the updates about delivery which never changed.... then a text came to my phone 19 mins after it was delivered. After getting the pizza a large two topping thin crust it was burnt, tasted stale, and the meat toppings ( which were only on one side as requested) was oily and dry. Needless to say my kids were disappointed and we threw it out.  Not a happy costumer."
1,Negative,Horrible customer service and crazy long wait.. It took 1:45 minutes to get my ordered pizza and wings. I even called back to see if the driver was close and the manager said he'd credit me for the wait.. Soo I called back two days later and the rude staff said we can't just give you free stuff cause your pizza took to long. You are better off going to get a frozen pizza. Don't waste your time or money!
1,Negative,We did the walk up slices.  Way overpriced and pizza tasted like frozen pizza.   They wouldn't give tap water so had to buy bottles.   No seating and wouldn't let us sit down in their patio even though it was not busy at all.   Tourist trap.
1,Negative,"Sent email saying pizza was on its way.  Got pizza 40 minutes later.  It was cold, and not good.  I love pizza hut, but this was disgusting.  The box was gross from where pizza had sit for so long."
1,Negative,"This was the most disappointing restaurant experience I've had in a long time. Though I never ate at the former location in Bethel Park, I wrongly assumed that an established business would have good food and good service. 

The very young hostess seated us right by the door on a day when it was 27 degrees outside. There were at least 10 empty tables where she could have seated us. She just wanted us to sit down so that she could go back to talking to her friend who was sitting at a nearby table. 

There was a man who I gather is the owner seated at the table next to us who heard us talk about how cold it was. He even watched me put my coat on because it was THAT cold. He had a small space heater at his feet and enough meat on his bones so I assume he didn't notice that it was freezing. 

I looked past that because I was so excited that the Pub and Pizza building was finally occupied again. We anxiously waited for our server to come and take our orders. We didn't wait too long. 

The woman was friendly enough but when we asked what they have to drink, she said she didn't know because she doesn't have a list. We asked if they have beer and she said yes then proceeded to list off your standard dive bar drafts and a vanilla 'port.' Um... Porter? 

We ordered our drinks as well as a pizza and some provolone sticks. When the pizza came she put it on a wobbly pizza stand and dropped off the cheese sticks. The pizza stand was so wobbly I thought the pizza may slide off. 

The food didn't look good. The cheese sticks weren't browned. They were sad, skinny sticks that were taken out of the freezer and dropped in the fryer. I've had better cheese sticks in a cafeteria. 

As for the pizza, it was terrible. Soggy and shiny - two things that food should not be. I'm sorry but if you have 'pizza' in your name, you should at least have a decent pie. It's laughable considering all of the good pizza in a 2 mile radius of the joint. 

We finished what we could and wanted to leave but our server disappeared. I went to the bar to ask if we could cash out. The bartender looked at me as if I were an alien. The owner rolled his eyes. He didn't even seem to care that his employees was
weren't taking very good care of his customers. 

Rather than cash me out, the bartender went to find the server. Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to take our card. 

All in all it was a bad experience. By the time we left we felt like the place didn't want customers. It's sad because they are in a good location. They won't last long unless they do huge business selling bud light and karaoke."
2,Negative,"First off- weird configuration with choppy separation of games and dining.  I like Dave & Busters where it's all more incorporated so parents can sit and still be in same room with kids while they play and we can enjoy food and cocktails.  So instead, I followed the kids around, lugging all the winter coats and hats.

After blowing $80 myself and another $100 with friends, we finally went to eat and ordered a bunch of pizzas.  They tasted more like frozen tombstone pizzas but bigger than I though based on yelp reviews.  The problem was service.  Other than taking the initial order and dropping food, we NEVER saw our waitress.  I had to literally walk around the dining room on three occasions flagging down OTHER waitresses for extra plates, drink refills, etc.  the dining area was NOT full.  Each server had maybe a maximum of 3 tables to serve.  

3 hours after being served and then after 20 minutes trying to hunt down our bill, I finally was fed up.  I saw three managers in a corner and approached them and told them what happened and asked for the bill.  Meanwhile, others in my party asked another waitress for my bill, who then found our waitress, who dropped it off.  We sat there, with credit card in the bill sleeve and again, waited and no one came to pick it up.  So I walked the bill and credit card to the manager myself.  The manager (Heather maybe) was on it.  She apologized profusely and said she understaffed the dining room.  I've waitressed before and if a server can't handle 3 tables, they need better servers. Without us asking, the manager comped the ENTIRE meal and gave us free 1 hour play cards.  

While the experience was frustrating- I would go back simply because management responded so well.  I felt bad too, thinking of leaving a tip for the server- not huge but something.  But I saw her talking to the manager and looking at our table and throwing her arms in the air in disgust and then storming off.  That just really turned me off.  She never apologized for any delay.  Not sure if right or not, and might get a lot of flak but I really don't reward bad servers.  We were a table full of hungry people and we sat with empty plates, etc. for. a long time.  That server really missed the opportunity to sell us a salad, some wings and dessert.  But she never checked in on us.

We will return and try the restaurant again simply to support the business and hope they fix their kinks.  And if we get decent service, we will tip appropriately.  But I hope they work this out- it could've been a great locals addition to Town Square."
1,Negative,"The worst pizza I've ever eaten! We were starving and ordered the Viva Las Vegas. I believe the Sopressata was rancid and picked it off. The crust was gooey and nasty. My bf loves meats and ate my pieces. The flavor of the meat permeated the cheese and I only ate some toppings so I had something in my tummy before attending a wine event! We left the event early as my bf started feeling Ill, nauseated by the time we got home and sick all night! I had much less discomfort which was 12 delay in the resulting surprise. 
Worse than Chuck E Cheese!
The cheap beer is the only thing that should be ordered here!"
1,Negative,"the worst i mean the worst customer service. my brother came in here ordered two large pizzas for during their happy hour service, and instead of paying 12.90 for them, he was charged full price $32. i came back with him and we told the cashier we wanted the happy hour price instead of the full price. got the money back, and returned 15 mins later to them having not even started our pizzas! don't catch us back here again."
1,Negative,Very poor customer service. I ordered food at 6:20 pm online my order didn't arrive so I called to see what was going on they said my order was cancelled because of the wrong number. Keep in mind it was placed off my sisters online account. They claimed they called and she said nobody ordered pizza but she's here with me. I said ok fine can I resubmit the order they said sure. 17 mins later I get a knock on the door and there is my pizza. The pizza was cold I told the driver it was ok take the pizza back and I would call and see if they can make my order fresh. I called in and the manager said oh well I can't give u a discount or anything because your number is wrong. That's the least you could have done. Poor customer service at best please do not order from this location!!
1,Negative,"Great place if you want to pay $13 for what tastes and looks like a frozen pizza. Ordered the house salad with lemon vinaigrette which was way too sour and cheesy garlic bread which was decent considering we were starving. Then our pizza came, a simple thin crust pepperoni pizza, which looked and tasted like a frozen pizza. It was served on cardboard... would not recommend and will never be returning."
1,Negative,"I've gone there twice, once when it first opened then again tonight.  Both times extreemly disappointed.   I only went back to give it another shot since I was hopping for my first night going was just an off night.  I was wrong.  The pizza honestly was gross.  It was cold, dough is heavy and flavorless,  sauce was watered down, pepperoni was bad quality and the cheese was actually the only good part.
We unfortunately left half of it and fed it to the birds outside lol.
I wouldn't recommend this place truthfully at all.
Worst part was the owner gave my pizza to another costumer by accident and made me wait another 15 minutes to make and other one."
1,Negative,"Today was an opportunity for Pizza Fire to shine or it would be our last visit. We had free pizza coupons due to lousy service on our last visit. Not much has changed except for the prices and the menu. Coupon stated unlimited toppings. I found out that fresh mozzarella was not a topping?  So I paid the extra $, scratching my head "" if it's not a topping what could it be""? Hey, I was getting a free pizza so $ wasn't a big deal. If you like soggy pizza you would have loved this one. My husband always orders the unlimited or build your own pizza.  Nope, not any more it is off the menu. My husbands pizza was as soggy as mine. Ugh! They were a little more organized than past visits but the pizza needs to improve. Looks like Neapolitan Pizza in the strip mall in front of Costco gets my business with friendly organized staff and a nice crust."
1,Negative,"Ordered this after 12 midnight. Asked for pepperoni with extra sauce and chicken fingers. The order was expected to be delivered in 45 min, it took 15. That was the only positive part of our experience. The fingers were dry and burnt... I mean black on one side, not just overcooked. The pizza is horrible. Barely any toppings, spongy crust. I will never order from them again. Disgusting. Not worth it,"
2,Negative,"Service was good but pizza was awful...dry, scant toppings & it took forever to arrive.  I'm missing Nello's already."
1,Negative,"I forgot why I haven't ordered from here in years. Now I remember after todays carryout.  Watered down marinara.  Dry breadsticks. Undercooked pizza. And messed up order (they forgot one of my toppings - bacon).  See photo.  I didn't call them  to rectify the problem, they'd probably give me the run around for their mistake and having to wait for my correct order, yeah, no, I was too starved to wait.  Papa makes better pizza. Always papa from now on."
2,Negative,"The pretzel app was great, salad good, but the pizza is completely lacking. The sauce is basically tomato paste."
2,Negative,"Note: This review is past due and it was for the time I visited during the month of March. 

Incredibly slow service. There were only two people in the restaurant yet we got our god damn pizza 30 mins later. I was very furious. To top it off, there were only two tables that were occupied and 20 or something vacant ones. Anyways, we ordered the BBQ pizza and once we received it, our first bite into the pizza had BBQ sauce dripping everywhere my plate. That is because they basically downed the whole pizza in BBQ sauce. Me and my friend could not even finish the pizza because it was too drenched with BBQ sauce. However, the pig inside me still gobbled most of it since I do love BBQ pizza.

Seriously, I never want to give a place a one star, because unless they actually treated their customers like trash, that would be the underlying decision to give them a one star. They really need to work on their service because I can only imagine if they were actually busy...if they ever are."
1,Negative,"The pizza wasn't that great at all and neither was the weird garlic bread. 
Wouldn't recommend at all."
2,Negative,"I had a mushroom and cheese pizza delivered.  The mushrooms were cannd, which I actually prefer, and there were lots of them.   The cheese was thick, not too greasy,  and not over seasoned.  The sauce was decent, meaning nothing that stuck out to me as exceptionally bad or good,  but that is where any goodness ends.

I'm from ny and I've only have one pizza in ohio that had a passable crust.   This was not it.

1.  Crust was covered in grease like PH
2.  There was not a lot on the edges of the pizza and what was was crispy or incredibly greasy.
2.  The crust below the pizza was thick and way too greasy.   

Overall a very poor showing.  I will never go back"
2,Negative,"NOT GOOD PIZZA. I can't hate them for making it cheap (that's why I went there), but it's probably the most bland excuse for pizza I've ever had...the first time I've ever been unenthusiastic about finishing leftover pizza.

Service was fine, and it was quick - it's just not very good food. If your only care is filling your stomach on $5, then this place is for you. If you are actually looking for something that tastes good, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. There are plenty of other pizza joints around that are a million times better."
1,Negative,"I'll start by saying the pizza is really great here and so is the pasta easily four stars. Ive been here a few times, and everyone was helpful. DO NOT GET the girl server with the forehead bangs she ruined our experience. 

TERRIBLE service. Wow. Came in Saturday with a couple of girlfriends, and our server was absolutely terrible. She took forever to bring us our menus, even longer to get our drinks out. It's not like she was even busy she was just screwing around on her phone at the end of the bar. We finally get her to come to the table and she was abrupt and short with us when answering some of the questions we had about the menu. When the food finally did come she practically slammed the plates down. My girlfriend didn't have silverware and again, we had to flag her down for ten mintues so we could enjoy the meal. Didn't get refills once, she didn't come by to ask how everything was. We weren't even half way through the meal when she dropped off the check, we still had a to go order to place and were thinking about dessert. We were long finished before she came back again and was really rude with us when we told her we needed to place two chicken parm dinners to go and she snachtched up the checkbook so fast. Don't know what her problem was. We asked for her superior but she told us he wasn't available, I'll talk to him next time we go in and he'll get an earful."
1,Negative,I have given this place 2 tries and they are just terrible. The sauce here taste funny and the overall pizza was not good. The worst thing about this place is the wait times. The last time I order over the phone app and it said my pizza was ready for pickup at 6:10pm. I got there right on time and watched them hand my order to the person in front of me. They then had to remake my order which made me wait there for 20 minutes.
1,Negative,"The place needs a facelift, badly. It felt grungy; there was a stain of some kind on one of the seats at our table and the table was sticky. Our daughter's ""cheese pizza"" was on a tortilla and the cheese was not melted all the way along with WAY too much sauce. Either the waitress or the chef got my order wrong (a totally different dish than I ordered) so while my family ate I had to wait for my food to be remade. Only good part about our experience was that we had a gift card so we only paid $13 after tip."
1,Negative,"Went to this place several times when first opened. Good pizza and good service. The last two times was poor. Went yesterday (10/24) Called in a carry out. Rep stated 15-20 mins. Arrived---no pizza stated 5 more mins,-- no problem. I waited and waited and waited and waited. 45 mins later it was ready with No apologize, nothing. I asked several times how much longer, each time 5 mins. End result: poor customer service, pizzas were wrong when I got home But they were good. It was apparent by looking thru the glass of the pizza making process several new people were working but not trained well. Would not suggest this place considering there is about a dozen pizza joints within 2 miles. But this would be a good location to open a real pizza restaurant."
2,Negative,The pizza came out late and cold but it was still good just wish it would have been warm. The spinach side dish was great. We also ordered the swordfish silicon which was a little dry but good sauce and nice veggies. Service was slow but we met a nice couple next to us from Australia so it helped pass the time.  Overpriced for the food court location.
2,Negative,"I definitely was not impressed with this place. Which was odd because nothing but great things about it.  The dining was freezing and you could tell the plumping was older. I got an order of their oven baked fries and they were no where near as good a deep fried one and you could tell that they came out of a bag. 

I ordered a personal pan pizza and it was a little greasy. I don't think I'd  go back on my own volition."
2,Negative,"My parents and I went here because we had a Groupon.  I was pretty excited to try it out since it is so close to my house and my previous favorite pizza joint wasn't cutting it.  This place was a major let down and I will not be going back there.

Meal:  I had a 12"", original crust pizza with olives, ham, and mozzarella cheese.  

Taste:  This was perhaps the most bland pizza I have ever had.  The crust didn't seem like it was cooked all the way . . . this is just a guess but I think it was a frozen crust.  I think a 2x4 with salt sprinkled on would have more depth and interesting flavors than this pizza.  4 out of 10.

Value:  Had it not been for the Groupon, this would have been way too expensive.  This place is crazy expensive and it really feels like they nickle and dime you.  2 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  The people who work there are incredibly nice and they sure got the pizza out quick.  The person who took my order was the only real bright spot during the experience.  10 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  It is a cute place but it would be nice if they had a place to sit down and eat.  I think if they did this, it would be a half way decent place to get lunch.  2 out of 5.

Overall:  Skip this place.  The food is not good and the value is just as bad.  I would go here if it was the last pizza place in the east valley.  18 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars."
1,Negative,"My bf and I came here hoping for a nice fancy meal to celebrate my birthday. He ordered the chicken meatballs and BBQ fries and I got the 10 oz classic-cut filet. Sad to say we were sorely disappointed. I shit you not, I have had a better steak at Chili's before and I fucking hate Chili's. Bf paid an exorbitant amount for 3 meatballs and over-seasoned mediocre fries. I got an awful over-seasoned (COVERED in black pepper), under cooked (ordered medium rare and got rare), tasteless, dry filet mignon steak. It came pre-cut so I assume the juices disappeared once the chef or server carved the meat before it got to our table.

Only redeeming dish were the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, but even that wasn't enough to make this more than a disappointing meal.

Total came up to $105, which is crazy for the quality (or lack of) we received. I was kind of expecting the bill to be discounted a bit because the manager came by to ask us what was wrong since we told our server the food was ""alright."" Not coming back again. You'd make a better decision choosing ANY of the other Cosmo restaurants. Even secret pizza would've been better."
2,Negative,"I feel like I'm being slightly generous with 3 stars.  The house is Absolutley.... Gross.  The bench seat cushions look extremely dirty and the worst part of all: it literally stinks like a seniors complex full of dirty depends.  If my wife and I weren't completely starving then we would have left.

We ordered the pizza which was recommended by the waitress. It tasted like a frozen pizza. Crust was far from fresh. Overall, a bad experience.  I'm changing it to 2 stars after writing this."
2,Negative,"Fast delivery as promised but I ordered a Sicilian pizza and the crust was just very bland and had absolutely no flavor. My wife stated that it tasted like cardboard, and I would have to agree. Their regular thin crust pizza is just ok, lacks taste. Hoagies soggy. Very overpriced for the quality, unfortunately. 

Just seems to be another example of a sub-par, cookie cutter pizza shop. The only thing I have to compliment on is really the sauce. The sauce is actually pretty good. I would recommend going to Primanti Brothers for your pizza desires. I'm very rarely disappointed by their pizza.

Sucks that I have to give such a crappy review, but I have absolutely nothing to rave about. Totinos party pizzas have more flavor. If you haven't already noticed, I feel their food is terrible. That is all."
2,Negative,"Way to expensive and the decor needs to be upgraded, you can find much better pizza and pasta at some other locations in the south hills.."
1,Negative,"Lousy experience.  Didn't think you could go wrong ordering a pizza until I ate here.  We didn't have to pay for the pizza, and ordered a salad to go. Even the salad was disappointing. Maybe the burgers are good?"
1,Negative,2 hours to get a pizza?  Really?  On a Monday?  And it's not like it's gourmet pizza...never again. Worst $30 I have spent in a minute.
2,Negative,"Many of the reviews on here are far too exaggerated. I am originally from Chicago and the pizza at Vito's is not even close to what we have there. It is quite a step even below Barro's, which I enjoy but is also not a good representation of Chicago.

I am speaking in regards to their deep dish, which is all that I have tried here. The pizza is not awful. It is pizza and when is pizza ever bad? However, it is nothing special and definitely below average. The prices are very high considering the quality of pizza. We spent over $30 for one pizza and a small side. For that price I expect something a lot better, so I don't think we will be back."
1,Negative,"Wish I could give less than 1 star.  Worst Pizza Hut delivery experience ever.  I understand I'm not spending $50 for pizza, however I live less than 2 miles away and it took them 1.5 hours to get here.  How is that even possible?  I checked in with the store after 45 min and they assured me it would be here within 10 min....twice...then I gave up.  If it was just me, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but when you have guests its matters."
1,Negative,"Domino's has ruined my night. I got home late, my delivery had just shown up, the number they had on file didn't know there was a pizza coming. I call the store for FIFTEEN MINUTES, at least TEN TIMES-no answer! Finally they answer their phone and then proceed to tell me the driver was too scared to come back to my house, actual words ""he said it was dark and he felt uncomfortable"" then the manager added the store was about to close, so all in all, my pizza cannot be delivered. I understand the manager cannot make his child of a driver deliver my pizza if he claims to be ""uncomfortable"", so I still want my pizza, and decide to go down myself for my now AT LEAST 20 minute late pizza-mmm, yum. Plus, it'll be nice to put a face to this driver who must be 12-yrs-old.
I get there, no one is up front when they KNEW I was coming! I literally waited three minutes before the driver noticed a customer up front and all he did was call for the manager and go back to the back. Guess what? He looked to be about 35 years old, what the-I'm really trying not to curse throughout this review, but I am LIVID. The manager comes up, looking like he's now the one scared of me, and by the way, this guy looks to be around 18. Not that he's too young to be a manager but he was obviously lacking confidence and intelligence from the whole scenario I'm having with him.
I'm just wondering a few things. Not why they have jobs at all, that would be mean, though the driver really needs to look into a new job if he can't drive to a normal looking neighborhood at night, definitely a poor choice for his career. But I'm also wondering why no one was checking the front more frequently, there was an extremely easily accessible donation jar in my reach the entire time. Someone could easily walk in and walk out. Why my phone calls weren't answered until they were almost closed-actually I was definitely calling longer than 15 minutes. I actually did ask him why they never answered the phone, his response was he was counting the inventory in the walk-in. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Your phone is ringing repeatedly during the span of a few minutes, you really aren't going to stop and answer?? Or if you couldn't hear it your employee couldn't tell you the phone was ringing REPEATEDLY!!!!!!??!!?!??!???!?!?!!
WHY THE HELL ARE THESE TWO THE ONLY ONES IN THE STORE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?!?!?? -Honestly, all this was just pasted from my Facebook post.
As a follow up, I was able to get a hold of the store's GM this morning to tell him about the FIVE charges I found on my bank account, essentially he solved my problem, refunding the money and also giving my a credit for my next pizza with them, but I was unimpressed by the feel I got from him on the phone.
 I really need the DM to be aware that this particular store seems to be falling apart and may need to be checked on.

2,Negative,"I was here for lunch with a small group. The nice-ish toppings on the pizzas, both the wood-fired and the pan, were overwhelmed by the thick, gluey crust mountains. Sort of what you might expect from the pan pizza, but I was disappointed in the crust of the wood-fired pizza. Also, there was a only a shadow of toppings on both pizzas. The music was ridiculously loud for lunch time. 

On the plus side: plenty of chic attire and ambience if you want to look around instead of talking.  Salads are pretty standard greens with dressing, but they remain the meal's high point. Doesn't add much that is new or interesting to the Madison restaurant scene (though maybe the bar time crowd is the target audience?).

I am, however, a huge fan of Chef Evan. I just wish he was still making his Spanglish-inspired sandwich at 4 & 20."
2,Negative,"Got pizza here before for my first time, just a standard large cheese and pepperoni.  While the pizza was excellent, their billing practice needs tweaked.  When I saw the total on the register, I pulled out my debit card and suddenly the total went a little higher after the guy saw my card... Much higher than just tax.  There was an unadvertised fee for using a card that they try to slip in when you aren't looking.  Not a good thing to pull on your customers, haven't been back since."
2,Negative,"This is a hard review for me because I used to love going to Crust for lunch every week or so, but the quality has gone down so far that I won't be back for a long time.

My concerns started about a year and a half ago when they began to make the lunch pizza slices in the morning, freeze them, and then heat them up when ordered.  Perhaps they did that prior, but the taste was declining so much that one day I asked the bartender about it and was told about the freezing process, so I stopped wasting my money on slices for lunch.  Since then I've still gone back for other lunch items but it can be very hit or miss... there is just no consistency from one day to the next.  The only item worth ordering is the regular NY style pizza, which is still great.  The same goes for the service, one day it's amazing and the next day it's just horrible.

My last visit was for a business lunch, and the service was decent, but 2 of the 4 dishes (including my chicken parm) were inedible.  Seriously, I have never had a worse piece of chicken in my life; I can't even explain it.  It was like cutting through crunchy plastic, and to make matters worse the breadcrumbs were mostly burnt and the entire dish smelled funny, like what a petting zoo smells like.

I truly hope they improve the quality back to what I remember, but honestly most of the time when a business starts going downhill and cutting corners on the quality of food, it doesn't recover.  Sorry."
1,Negative,Worst pizza place ever. The pizza slice is very hard to chew. I think they must put it for more than one day. It's cheap but tastes horrible.
1,Negative,"Doesn't even deserve the one star.

I don't generally give bad review's, but my experience here was inexcusable.

Service was horrible, with a forced smile from the waitress only when giving us the bill. Waited on table bread for 1 hour, but it never came. Restaurant wasn't busy at all, but our appetizers took 75 minutes to come out. Followed by two flavorless pies with the least amount of toppings possible, even for a Neapolitan style pizza.

Save your money, and stick to the pizzerias that do it best in this city. Queen Margarita, Pizzeria Libretto, etc.."
2,Negative,"Its a cheap pizza by the slice type place. You can ""dine"" in or out but they dont have a restroom and sent me across the street. (Can you even serve food in a dinning area and not have a restroom?)

I wasnt distracted by the flashing lights of the casino and made it back over to buy a slice. I normally love pizza by the slice places as they are quick and easy to carry as you go to your next stop.

This pizza fit those categories but it was made with low quality meat and cheese. Was kinda bummed out with it. 

The next time I'm on Fremont st I will definitely find somewhere else to eat."
1,Negative,Last time the pizza was bomb... this time it was suuuuper fucking greasy and the bread was so thin you couldn't even lift the slice without it breaking off/sliding ... lame... walked from Ceasars specifically for this slice... what a bummer
1,Negative,"Worst pizza place in town  If Rocco isn't in the store run the other way.  Very inconsistent! Pizza will be burned one day and the next the crust will be under cooked and soupy,  Worth ZERO stars."
1,Negative,I can't even give this place a proper review because when I came here with my friends they sat us down with the menus and literally ignored us for 40 minutes. We weren't even able to put an order in. We kept on trying to get the attention of the servers walking around but I don't know if they just pretended not to see or they were actually paying that little attention to their guests. It wasn't even that busy. There were only a couple other tables in our area. There were groups of people that came in after us and got their orders taken and drinks served while we were just sitting there waiting for them. Like I work in a restaurant too so it's just mind blowing that you could ignore a table in your section so hard that they sit there for 40 minutes waiting to order. Like if it took 40 minutes for the food to come I could understand that more. But just to take our orders???? We ended up leaving because we were staving and didn't want to wait any longer and just went to get pizza from pizza pizza.
1,Negative,"We've ordered from them in the past and it was always good.  Expensive, but good.  Tonight was a whole different story.  The guy who answered the phone was confused, sort of like he was a customer and heard the phone ringing so he grabbed it.  The next guy got our address wrong 3 times (there's only 4 numbers in it).  

Food gets here and, well, it just wasn't good.  We ordered extra cheese on our pizza and got about 1/2 as much as normal.  We ordered wedding soup.  I have no idea what it was that we got, but it was gross.  It was like some canned chicken broth, little pasta, 3 tiny meatballs, weird green stems and scrambled eggs.  Basically yellow swill with green stems floating in it.  BLECH!

The pizza that really had no taste was $16.50.  The Giant Eagle throw in the oven pizzas are much better than this was tonight.

I think we'll be crossing Sainatos off of our pizza place list.  $40 is too much to gamble with for pizza."
1,Negative,"Just had a ridiculous interaction with Linda, the owner, over a $7 Groupon coupon. Sad really. There are so many pizza places; she needs to appreciate it's the little things that keep customers happy"
1,Negative,"Last night we ordered from this location, my pizza had hair in it. This is after the delivery guy attempted to hold on to $20 in a tip and we had to gang up on him to get it back. Then when they redelivered the pizza over 30 mins later,  it still came with hair. I think it's absolutely ridiculous and nasty for kitchen workers not to wear gloves or hairnets and still deal with cash. This location and the workers are disgusting and they should be closed down before they get someone really sick."
1,Negative,"Not sure what these positive reviewers had... but we had the worst pizza ever here. It was literally bread and cheese, we hardly had any sauce. Wanted to like this place since it's close but nope won't be going back"
2,Negative,"Only giving it 2 stars because the pizza was good. A special was written on the outside board, but when I asked about it they said it was no longer available. Ordered garlic knots and pizza and only pizza was brought out. No plates and no garlic knots. When the pizza was brought out, we were asked if we wanted garlic bread instead, without any explanation. Decided not to get garlic bread. Hubby went next door to get doughnuts to take home with us, while we were waiting for our food. They wouldn't allow us to bring a dozen doughnuts in. The bathrooms were a mess with no soap and the service wasn't good. We won't be returning."
2,Negative,"I live literally two blocks from this place and have heard rave reviews from my boyfriends brother.  So we decided to give it a try.  We got mixed results.  However, it was never great.  We get take-out a lot.  The wings are small and soggy, not crispy.  The pizza is decent but has a weird almost cookie-like textured crust, which is not to my liking.  The sauce is weird too.  I remembered I ordered a chicken breast Philly cheese steak sandwich one time and by the time I got it home, I realize it was a half a roll with two dried up pieces of chicken, some onions and peppers, and no cheese.  I usually don't get upset but I was pissed.  There wasn't a lot of fries with my order either.  $9 for a piece of stale bread and dried up meat.  We don't order from there any more.  Rounders on Blue Diamond is a little further from us but well worth the drive.  

Home Plate is a fun little bar with lots of games and great atmosphere and a fun menu.  It gets really smoky, however, and the menu doesn't seem to deliver.  Everything looks good but disappoints in the end."
2,Negative,"I ordered delivery from here for a lot of people (4 pies). The service was good (fast and the pizzas were really hot when they got to us), and the price was low. The pizzas were not that great though. I'd order from here again for a big group, but if I'm just getting one pie, I'd go somewhere else."
2,Negative,"I usually don't order from pizza hut. It's expensive compared to others. Sorry I did -  what a waste of money. I ordered a thin crust that had very little cheese , was cold, looked like it sat around on a shelf for awhile. Won't be ordering from them again."
2,Negative,"It's great to see places like this popping up in the neighbourhood but I was disappointed with the quality of the food. You can find fantastic Italian food everywhere in Toronto so I guess I was expecting a lot. But if I'm going out for pizza or pasta, it needs to hit the mark. The pizza here was pretty terrible...  just tasteless dry dough...  and my bf had lamb ragout pasta, and yeah the portion was big but all we could taste was garlic. Maybe we shouldn't have chosen pizza or pasta at this Italian pizza & pasta restaurant.

Everyone seems to be blown away so far..... is it just because we're so happy to have something in the neighbourhood other than GBK and the food court at gerrard square mall? well played Aprile Bambina, well played..."
1,Negative,"This pizza joint offers a lunch buffet which I TRIED to have last week. I stopped in at 12:15 or so. No buffet. I asked the person working at the front about it and she said they were running behind and would have it out soon. So i sat down to wait a bit. After 10-15 minutes it was clear no buffet soon. So i went a few doors down to Bobbie O's BBQ and had their as usual great pulled pork sandwich. 

I had to walk past this place on the way back to my car 20 minutes later. Looked in the window. Still no buffet. 

So if I could, i would give no stars because i was unable to even try it.  

Judge for yourself."
1,Negative,"Family ate here tonight...had a deluxe 9"" pizza...had to have been store bought the nuked by this place...first time eating here...won't again...i can say the salads and sandwiches are pretty good...don't get the pizza..."
1,Negative,"I used to love Pizza Hut.  It used to be my one and only pizza place, but ever since moving into this neighborhood, I've had nothing but terrible pizza, so I switched to Papa Johns (!).  The pizza ends up really thin and greasy; there's really nothing to it.  What a waste.  Plus, they don't do the stuffed crust pizza promos that other Pizza Huts do...so, this place is just a lose-lose.  Gross, awful, and expensive.  Plus, the delivery drivers ALWAYS CALL YOU BEFORE THEY'VE ARRIVED, which means they're expecting you to meet them at the door, and they're not even there yet!  At least I don't waste money on tips?

After four months of Papa Johns, I thought to myself, ""That Pizza Hut couldn't have been THAT bad,"" so I tried it again.  Someone tell me how to get this gross, greasy taste out of my mouth.

In short, even if you like Pizza Hut, stay away.  This place is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever ordered from."
1,Negative,"We checked out the yelp reviews before ordering for delivery tonight. Although there were a few very bad reviews we decided to give it a shot. That was a mistake. 

We waited an hour and a half for an order that was estimated to be delivered at 40-50 minutes. At already over an hour, we checked the tracker to find our food had been cooked for over an hour and had yet to be delivered. 

Finally we got our food and not only was the delivery driver was rude, our food was completely cold. 

Wasted 30 dollars on cold mediocre pizza and terrible customer service. Don't order from this location."
2,Negative,"These people are rude. I ordered my pizza online, got a message saying it's ready, went to pick it up and noone greeted me. At all!! I stood there at the register and they didn't even acknowledge I was there. A customer came in after me and the lady looked around me to help HIM and still didn't acknowledge me! It took them 40 minutes to get my pizza out, which was cold! I counted 5 people came in and were greeted, ordered and got there pizzas BEFORE mine! Horrible.

I did call to express my disappointment and they gave me a credit."
2,Negative,Pizzas in this place are good. But for the price on the menu you can go to better places. The device is not good. Paper rolls to ideas napkins??? When I go out and I pay that price for pizza I expect something better. Will not go back.
1,Negative,"We have been to this location before and the pizza was great! This time it was 9pm on a Saturday night, we walked in to find 6 ppl sitting at the bar and  one  bartender working.  All the tables were empty so we chose one that was  clearly visible from the bar.  We aren't  gamblers and were only there for the pizza. We waited a couple minutes, the bartender never acknowledged us.  I then decided to keep my eye on him to see if he looked up or made any move to help us.  At one point he came out from the bar, I thought maybe to find a server or help us, no he went to the kitchen to retrieve food for someone at the bar.  No eye contact was ever made with us.  When another guy came in,clearly a regular, he was greeted with ""hi buddy"" immediately.   We waited a total of 10-12 minutes and no effort or eye contact was ever made to get us to move to the bar or order. I asked my husband ""Move to the bar, or leave?""  We left.  
It's a shame that this place that has excellent pizza probably won't make it because of no customer service. Good luck!"
1,Negative,"Ridiculous,  should be no stars as no food was prepared when I ordered for pick up. Placed order online for 4 pizzas and several orders of wings. Received confirmation email and pick up time and NO notification that that we were ""supposed""to call and confirm... 

Showed up at our designated time to pick up the order for our staff with of course nothing even started and was informed we were supposed to call and confirm by the older gentleman working there. 

Horrible customer service and respect for time.  Would hate to see you call to make an appointment at ouroffice and then we cancel it because you didn't call us again to confirm that you really did want your appointment you already scheduled. 

Little Caesars here we come.

1,Negative,"Zero Stars if I could!  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, someone open another kind of pizza place and not Domino's either!  I will say, that when they DO get the pizza right, it's pretty good but I have had soooo many problems with this place.  So far they have credited me with so much since they have messed up so often.  I really do not want the credits, I WANT THE PIZZA RIGHT!  One time I ordered online for a later delivery because we were not home yet they showed up 30 minutes before we were home and then tried to come back and deliver the same pizza.  Another time they got our order wrong and it took 90 minutes to get it right.  One time the delivery guy dropped my personal pan pizza on the ground while taking it out of the hot box and promised to get a new one out right away, it took over an hour (I live about a mile from the store).  Sometimes they forget the receipt, which really freaks me out because I have no proof of purchase with all of their mistakes.  For the most part the toppings are skimpy and I've actually taken pictures of the pizzas because I could not believe they would deliver a pizza like that and then I ordered a pizza and used a coupon code that was sent TO ME and it said it wasn't valid at this Pizza Hut.  Why the heck are they sending me coupons that DON'T work at the Pizza Hut I order from?

I'm to the point of opening my own pizza place that delivers because this is just crazy!  The only reason I continue ordering is that when the pizza IS FINALLY right, my kids like it but trust me, they would like it better if the pizza was right every time as I think they are tired of hearing of me complain about Pizza Hut!!!!"
1,Negative,"Haven't eaten here in a while. Tonight, ordered like 4 pizzas and bread sticks for take out. 


Terrible!   Undercooked.  Greasy. 

I'll never order from this location again. 

Entire slices had grease dripping from underneath. 

Breadsticks still had garlic dripping."
2,Negative,"I'm not sure about the other reviews - but I was there on Thursday and the pizza was TERRIBLE!!  No flavor, and it was expensive!  Including tax and tip it was a $23 pizza (medium, 10"") and I only ate 2 slices.  

The wings were good.  We had Honey Garlic, Dill Pickle, Suicide and Thai Peanut.  Don't order the thai peanut - they weren't good, but the rest were fine.

I would go back for the wings only and not the pizza.  Tuesday and Thursday is Wing Night.  10 Wings for $2.50.  we sat in the lounge.  The service was pretty quick."
2,Negative,"I don't know why you would spend 14$ on a pizza from this place when you can go to Albertson's, which is right across the street, and get a DiGiorno pizza for 4$ that tastes the exact same.  Plenty of better pizza places nearby, I suggest skipping this particular one."
2,Negative,"Okay pizza, was convenient for us because we live down the street. However, we will not be going there again because of the ""we support Red for Ed"" sign prominently displayed in their window.  We were going to eat there today but barely opened the door and walked out ... to another restaurant.  We are not interested in supporting socialist causes."
2,Negative,"Maybe I should have read the reviews prior...

Told me my pie would be to me within THE hour...I clarified within AN hour right?  Correct.  An hour seems a bit long for a place 2 miles away.  1:15 later, called in and aoh yes, the driver is just leaving now.  nice.  $5 off the next pie ok?  NO.  ok $10 off the next.  Fine.  Arrived 1:38 minutes after ordering.  No high hopes here.  

Pizza was luke warm at best.  Lovely.  and the wrong type!  We ordered DEEP DISH, got PAN.  Now if you read the menu, which I did, they have deep dish and pan.  Now I understand that.  called back and got a manager that tried to explain that deep dish means pan to them on their system!!  R U kidding me????  I am not interested in solving your corporate stupidity, I want the pizza I ordered and I ordered it exactly how it is listed on your site!

Now the only thing that kep them from a 1 star rating is the manager offered to send another pizza for free, which I turned into next time and I did not have the time to wait for another timely delivery.  So KUDOS to the manager for doing the right thing, however everything else left a lot to be desired.  I know I will go back for 1 more pizza at least..."
1,Negative,"I posted a negative review of the pizza, wings, and drink, mistakenly under my wife's account. The owner responded, no offer to make it right, just ""I'm sorry you didn't like our food"" and the he proceeded to defend bad food, slow delivery, a cup of ice(that they called a drink). If your gonna get a bad review offer to make it right for the unhappy customer to try to retain there business, rather than make excuses and say the customer is wrong. I read other reviews as well, and any responses to the bad reviews  were the same, excuses, saying there was nothing wrong, saying how they've been in business for 30 years, blah blah blah. Own it dude, your pizza sucks, your so called jumbo boneless wings that would satisfy a cat, and poor delivery time, and a cup 3/4 full of ice when finished, do not make for ""good food""! and when I said I have had caffeteria pizza better, I mean it, my school pizza was better than this tasteless, soggy, no topping, cardboard pizza. I moved here from Mi. and I have been looking for a ""good pizza"", so far Pizza Hut is the best I've found in Charlotte. Romanello's is worse than Domino's, at least when I had an issue at Dominos' they gave me my order remade another day for free, and a free item of my choice. So while they messed up initially, they made it right, that is why I will go back to Domino's, but never to Romanello's."
2,Negative,"The building is beautiful. But you pay for it in the food. Unfortunately the food is not particularly great (especially for what you're paying) 12 dollars or so for an extremely salty procutto pizza with no sauce for one. The bar selection seemed good, and thry had a decent beer selection."
1,Negative,"Stopped in for the lunch special. I was going to get two slices and a drink, but one slice looked sufficient, so I went with that. 

All the pizzas look like cheese pizza because the pepperoni and the sausage are buried miles below the cheese. You practically need a magnifying glass to see there's pepperoni in it.

Here's where the story ends: One bite, and the cheese/pepperoni came off all at once like a wet blanket, leaving only the tomato-sauce covered crust remaining. Um... okay.... so, buh-bye to that whole slice of pepperoni as I bought it and hello to a remaining piece of dough covered in tomato sauce.  Yummy if I had a hangover and didn't care. Not so yummy if all I wanted was just a slice of pepperoni pizza. Is it too much to expect that cheese and pepperoni to remain on that slice of pizza until, oh, I don't know, I'm done eating it? Shouldn't some cheese and pepperoni remain on that slice for a second bite, and third bite, and a fourth bite, and a fifth bite, until I'm done eating it?

Taste-wise? Well, not sure how accurate my assessment would be as I had to chew it all up all at one so I didn't spit it out and then re-eat it (because that would be gross.) But I did taste a lot of cheese. And I could tell there was some garlic in it. Sorry I can't describe the taste with any more accuracy than that. 

Peter Piper Pizza is better than this. Heck, even a frozen pizza is better than this.  If I ever return, I will be sure to bring a knife and fork to be sure I don't lose that slice on the first bite."
2,Negative,The staff are very friendly but the quality is mediocre at best. They put so little cheese on their pizza and it's mostly dough. Unless it's your last option late at night... this is a skip.
1,Negative,This place has really gone done hill and they make no apologies. I have ordered many a pizzas from here and service has been like a plane crashing. Last few order have taken over 45 min to pick up from the time I ordered them. One time it took and hour and 11 min. No apologies and every time I asked about my order it was the same response just 5 minutes. It was five minutes 20 minutes ago.  Come on.  You guys didn't make my pizza yet. I've just moved on.
1,Negative,"After making an order online, I found a hair baked into my slice of pizza! Immediately, I became disgusted and ruined my whole families appetite and mines. I called and talked to the Manager Billy who was completely unprofessional and arrogant, he then demanded I bring back the pizza (we threw this pizza away) or else he couldn't replace our order. After explaining that I threw this pizza away, his response was ""What are you trying to get something for free""? I have a history with Pizza Hut and they can look up my number and I have never asked for a refund of any one of my orders, I am a hard working man who don't need a $7.99 pizza for ""FREE"" all I wanted was to provide my family with dinner of their choice. After all the other options there is in laveen, we will be ordering Barro's next time and EVERY TIME after! See my picture I attached to this Pizza Hut if you don't believe me."
2,Negative,Last night I ordered my friends and I some pizza. I opened the box to find a short black hair laying there. The pizza did arrive on time and the delivery guys are always nice but seeing the hair made me lose my appetite. Hopefully this isn't a common occurrence.
2,Negative,"Review update:
Still 2 stars.

The good:
- Pizza is good (especially for delivery pizza)
- Not that expensive (definitely not cheap but considering the quality of ingredients, I think it's an inexpensive price)
- Driver is always polite

The bad:
- Estimated delivery time: 610pm. Actaul delivery time: 530pm.  This is the opposite of the usual Pizzaiolo experience. Why wouldn't I consider this a good thing? Because now I'm used to getting the Pizza 90m from when I order it, so I order it and plan to do other things before it arrives. They have taught me to expect it to take forever so I work around that.  The inaccurate/often ridiculous delivery times are really frustrating.
- My pizza had the wrong toppings on it today. It was still good but it wasn't what I ordered. I double checked my online order to make sure I hadn't made a mistake in their crazy-stupid online ordering system (it's a series of 100 radio buttons) but I hadn't.

Overall, I will still order this pizza again, and I guess not know when it will be delivered or what I'm actually going to get, but I'm sure it will still be good. 

I always want to order their wings but I never do."
1,Negative,"I am not to happy with this location, I ordered pizza thinking it would be delivered fresh.

First thing was it took them nearly 2 hours to deliver and Pizza Hut sent me an email stating it was just going to be 45-60min. 
   Second, when the pizza was delivered it tasted like old pizza, as if it was sitting in the drivers car for awhile. 

Overall, not just they're service was terrible but the quality of pizza being made at this location isn't acceptable to me."
2,Negative,"As with most businesses, there will be good and bad reviews, and hopefully I can come back at a later date to write a good one. However, my first experience with Gus' was quite negative.
I ordered a pizza online, gave the card number to pay for it and received a confirmation/order number. The pizza was supposed to be delivered within an hour. An hour later, no pizza, so I called. Gus' had no record of our order, no specials and no website, or so I was told, and yet, I was looking at the website as the employee was telling me they didn't have one. I went to the bank and sure enough, money had been taken out to pay for pizza at Gus'. I called again.
One of the most curious things was the different stories I got depending on the employee I was speaking to. During one phone call I was told that the order was on its way. I waited. Nothing. I called again. No record of the transaction, no order placed, no pizza on its way. I inquired how a pizza could be ""on its way"" if there was, allegedly, no order placed. I was placed on hold several times as the employees desperately tried to get answers to these questions they could not answer. Finally the manager. No record of an order placed, yet paid for. An interesting business practice. 
Needless to say, it was a frustrating experience and an investigation is under way. The funds should be returned in 2-3 business days, but for now, I have no access to them and no pizza.
Think I'll stick with Papa Murphy's; for delivery service is like a box of chocolates-- you never know what you'll get, or in this case, if you'll get."
