I will return when i am in the area. happy to say that i am expecting a new york location to open up in the near future and that it should be a pleasure to visit! the pizza was excellent and the combination of the tasty crust, the right amount of mushrooms, and the proper amount of mushrooms to get you through a long day in the office was what set this place apart from the crowd. a steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their pizzas and they all knew the gentleman serving them. he was a nice man. the line never got long.

I will return, but first time i ate there i ordered a pasta and it came with cheese. now that it's my turn to eat there i gotta say that i was a bit skeptical. but the pizza was amazing! very thin crust, huge impact. they make it like pizza brutta on monroe st, where instead of being covered with a layer of cheese it gets a few chunks of tomato.  da bomb.<|endoftext|>Follow me on instagram @alexandria and facebook.com/alexandria for all the latest news!

bottom line is poor quality pizza and a busy location make good pizza difficult to please.

Perfect pizza, pizza that you can build your own toppings just like pizza at home. they use whole wheat dough which is great if you're gluten free. my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. not a big deal, really.

piola is a small place that i consider to be very close to my house.  it's a medium pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and tomato but the ratio of the ingredients is on point and the pizza is fantastic!  the sauce is not on the thick side and so is the pizza itself.  

piola is typically very busy at noon and is usually packed when i am out drinking.

they bring the pizza to your table, but it's much easier said than done.

Perfect pizza, fresh, tasty ingredients on the top and bottom! recommend the mushroom pizza and the italian beef pasty. the sweet potato pizza is yummy and has a decent amount of mushrooms. also ask for the spicy oil. that adds a lot of flavor to it. 

quebecois beware. there aren't handfuls of hot peppers that you can pick your nose at.  there are only a few tiny dried peppers, which you must strain before consumption.  you must try them all because they are unique.  if you are a first-timer i would definitely suggest splitting that with a more standard pizza,  as it requires more concentration.

also known as the acela, the area's other pizza style pioneered by great-grandpa california. now celebrating it's fifth year, the pizza is consistently well made and needs no introduction. the slices are large and they are always hot.  very friendly staff!!

Perfect pizza. my local go to place. no one here but the lucky few who order through them. those of us who are in the know know know how busy and cold this place is. we have ordered from them multiple times and have never been let down. be sure to ask for the free hot peppers olive oil mix...mmm! 

this place has a lot going for it.  the atmosphere inside is nice and it's like stepping away from the busy area just outside its doors. you will have an awesome meal. highly recommended!"

Perfect pizza, that's what everybody's talking about. i'm not crazy about this style of pizza, it just takes too long. 

it's hardly a town square, it has a nice mix of buildings. the restaurant has a mural on the wall of the entire plaza, which was a nod to the many years of waiting for a table. 

i really enjoyed this little spot on a number of factors. the pizza was excellent, and the combination of the tasty salami and the large serving of pasta - great on an over-the-counter basis, great with a family - great for sharing with your date. 

the other reason i'm giving this spot a thumbs up - despite the fact that it's only been

Perfect pizza and i assume that includes the goat cheese which they add to all the pizza you buy. i ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like i was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza i was going to consume. according to their website:

"add a sprinkling of sea salt to half of your pizza for even more deliciousness.

or you can just pretend like you don't like spicy things, and you will be good to go!

my fav thing to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at cinema du parc. they stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly."
"you get dinner here and then move on to the

Perfect pizza (in my opinion superior to all others i've had in the valley) and they were phenomenal!

fantastic warm and welcoming service.

fast.

good prices.

good product selection.

good bang for the buck.

easy to navigate through their purchasing page.

easy to customize your own pizza.

bottom line - great place to get pizzas and shakes.<|endoftext|>In the past week we have visited familie and diavola pizza places.  there was a great pizza and salad party at this place, great service and great food.  we will be back to try some more.  although it says it has good service that is not necessarily true.  the

Perfect pizza and i was sold. price was good. delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and the pizza was right on time. i will highly recommend if you are a fan of good pizza. my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. not a big deal, really.

Perfect pizza. the mozzarella cheese was really good! very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. we both loved the pizza. some of the garlic bread was incredible! i think garlic bread would be perfect on a pizza but i don't know what else they serve. some of the garlic bread was even chopped!  so many great things about this place!  steaks, ham, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and just general good pizza -- we will explore other items they offer in the future!  my husband said they were extremely helpful when he called in his order.

we got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. i was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. i was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in sautéed onions, but wow were they good. seasoned perfectly
^
Perfect pizza and i'm happy.  delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and breadsticks were hot on arrival and the delivery guy was friendly. 

the tasting menu that came with the order was very interesting indeed, and while i wasn't able to try everything that came with the pizza, i did enjoy a jar of their red chili sauce - it was interesting, and not too sweet, which i was expecting. 

the wings on the other hand, were quite possibly the best chicken ever, and they were really, really good.  the serving is large, so if you want to up your game, try the wings.  

both the pizza and the breadsticks

Perfect pizza and i don't see why not.  the prices are very reasonable and the knowledgeable staff is on hand to make sure you know what you are getting and what to expect.  ambiance is cozy and modern but not overly so.  simplicity in presentation is key and whatever you order the pizza is done by-passing the chef.  users please bear in mind that the pizza here is just that, pizza.  there is no added sauce, garlic, tomato, or parsley.  this is just a pizza, after all.  no additional toppings are offered, but you do get a pizza that is done by the time you are ready.

^
Perfect pizza, amazing sauce. at this price you can't go wrong and if you are a regular at all piola you will have a pretty good pizza. the thin crust is for suckers and the rich is for jerks. the mediterranean pizza is great and has an excellent garlic bread component. beware of the garlic bread portion as it is extremely hot to eat raw. buy the full size instead as it is much easier to consume.

overall great place to get pizzas.  it's a great neighbor place so always nice and friendly.

it's a pleasure to serve you and your family.  we look forward to serving you soon."

Perfect pizza. i wish i had taken a picture so you could see the garlic powder mix, but it was a top priority for me to not to mention it was liberally sprinkled on top! in my opinion, a great pizza needs to be a little greasy to eat, but beautifully so. in my brief time there, i have yet to find a bad pizza. great service. overall, i was very pleased with this place."

"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and i do admit the flavor is marginally better than caesar's $5 pizza. the only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking wet from being drenched in oil. 

alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals. the pizza was disappointing - mostly because of the wait - but there was a small child playing with the velcro on the bottom crust that wasn't too disappointed.

Perfect pizza and i think its better than dead zone. the margherita has a nice flavor and it was interesting to see how the bartender would put it together. if you like strong drinks, go elsewhere. if you like strong food, go to dead zone.  bar close to it.

service: okay. staff does their job. something i will mention is that they are really nice when they are not polishing their bar.  very friendly staff.

price: average. average is better then dead zone,  where you can get a slice for like 5 bucks.  which is kind of ironic. dead zone is cheap, but sloppy, and unorganized.  at least with the bbq sauce,  there was at

Perfect pizza. we are a local couple that have had the honor of dining with the owners several times.  they are very on point when it comes to their food and are very helpful with their directions.

Perfect pizza!!!  it's my ""special treat"" when i need one. it's hard to find good pizza anywhere near me, but i have to say they know how to shake an excellent one here.  a huge part of what makes this place special is the staff. they are very understanding and patient with their customers.  i will wager a guess that if i needed to take a huge bite of pizza here and there would be at least 2 other people there helping me.  a steady flow of customers would approach the counter to ask for their order, and it would be over an hour wait for my food to come.  my guess is they don't serve pizza like this all the time, but rather pizza like this where they can actually

Perfect pizza smells so good to boot!  i am a huge fan of the hot cookies though.  a rare gem in this city!!
it's not that i'm 9 months pregnant that i was able to eat an entire pizza here, but that the pizza here is that good!!  my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers.  that was the gist of the pizza, and i'll be posting pictures of it too.  the hot cookies were quite a treat too, and i definitely recommend them if you're a fan of heavy handed discipline.

Perfect pizza...again and again.

first time i ate there i ordered 2 xl pizzas, which were enormous. they were a generous portion with a nice flavor.

he said they were very busy at the time, so i guess it wasn't the best idea to order them immediately.

second time i ate there i got a pizza special that was 75% off. i ordered them earlier in the morning to be ready at 11:30 for lunch. when i walked in a few minutes before 11:30 they were just coming out of the oven. they were ready when i walked in, and were only $0.75 - a great deal!

some of the reviews on yelp are really good.

"excellent pizza! i travel a lot and one of my favorite things in different cities is to try a locally owned pizza place. delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and breadsticks were hot on arrival and the delivery guy was friendly. 

the breadsticks came with a really flavorful sauce and themselves were perfectly baked and seasoned. the pizza was just a cheese pizza and the ratio of the ingredients on the pizza was on point and tasted great! 

as much pizza as i eat i ought to be considered an expert and if i wasn't leaving town tomorrow i'd be visiting these guys again. great food. thank you!"

Perfect pizza. service was great. pizzas were hot and fresh. staff was great. overall great experience. great place to get pizzas.
"first time eating here and was very impressed with ""the cheef"" sandwich, great flavor. friends said the pizza was really good too."
"vegan options in downtown vegas!!! pizza was super tasty and the service was pretty decent. half way through baking my pie they remembered that i only wanted mushrooms on half, so they took it out of the oven and picked them off.  kind of weird, but whatever."
authentic italian pizza made with fresh ingredients! do yourself a favor and place an order tonight! personally love the quattro formaggio pizza!

every trip from nyc to pitt includes a visit to aiello's. 

if there's one thing i know about aiello's it's that they never fail to deliver. 

i'm not really a pizza enthusiast so when i say they never fail to deliver. i really mean it.  every time i've ordered from them the pizza has been correct and delicious.  on the plus side they never force you to overindulge or burn your mouth.  

the only time i've had a bad experience is when they don't have out-of-state delivery so i can't comment

Perfect pizza -- we didn't try any specialties we just wanted pizza that was good, quick and done by us. nice service also and the place was packed with patrons."

Perfect pizza and i am a pizza lover after all. my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. not a big deal, really.

i'll be back."
"my boyfriend and i heard about this place from a friend so we decided to try it out. food and service was awesome! we had tyler as our server; he was super nice and just the right amount of attentive. he also was really knowledgable about their beer list as well as the menu.

we ordered a lot more food then we could have finished

Perfect pizza, amazing sauce, amazing delivery. pizza was amazing! i ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like i was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza i was going to consume. they give a good amount of salad! the feta in the mediterranean salad is super yummy, though on the salty side.

i also tried the giant slice of pizza they give to the homeless. it was tasty, and the crust was cooked to perfection."

Perfect pizza but with chicken and it was awesome. kind of pricey but well worth it.

overall very good pizza but i prefer pizzas to be bigger because they're much easier to clean and there's less messy up afterwards."
"i would give this spot 10 stars if i could. this is as close as it gets to real italian pizza, which i have eaten plenty of in italy. that means, great crust, and no ""american"" tomato sauce or any other hot peppers. i just love the mild, garlicky sauce.

all pizza toppings are really good. i am not a huge tomato lover but these babies are phenomenal.

service is quick and friendly.

Perfect pizza, but it was good! i was essentially eating a baked pizza, minus the prosciutto because i was in the mood for vegetarian (i'm sure it's delicious with the prosciutto too though). it was very tasty indeed, but the serving was large so somebody give me a shout if ya want to split it evenly... :)"
"i ordered 2 xl pizzas, the mama mia and the grilled garlic chicken. they were incredible! i ordered them earlier in the morning to be ready at 11:30 for lunch. when i walked in a few minutes before 11:30 they were just coming out of the oven. they were hot and fresh. great service! i will definitely be back!"

the pizza was very good. 
the garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was very good. 

the garlic bread was not only delicious, it was also from around this same location. 

i will definitely be back. 

we are delivery junkies for this place.  every time we go there

Perfect pizza and i do recommend the pepperoni's . they are real, they are fresh, and they are the type of pizza you want to share with your date.  if you are a first-timer i would definitely suggest splitting that with a more standard pizza,  i'm sure it would be much easier to enjoy by the slice.  my date and i both had the same reaction - wow, that was delicious!  the pepperoni's were not overly sweet or overly processed,  they just stood out clearly.  i realize this may sound weird, but the pizza here is consistent - fresh, tasty, and prompt service.  this may sound strange, but i LOVE this place!

Perfect pizza but with vegetables! my only complaint is that the paneer bread that came with the chicken was quite dry.  i don't know what their recipe is but it was simply bread cubes that came with the chicken.  that said, the paneer bread that came with the chicken was also quite good.  i had it plain and it was not home made but it was something that came with the chicken.  that said, the garlic bread that came with the chicken was also good.  i had it with eggs and it was not too thick or too thin but it was enough to get you going.  i had a cheese pizza and i must say that was not a negative comment as i had never had a cheese pizza fail me before.

Perfect pizza. my only complaint is that while i was flipping through the menu, i happened to glance at the delivery section labeled Lunch.  which it was, i flipped through the menu expecting to find a pizza that met my needs.  delivered to my suite in nothing but pizza and wings.  which i did, and although the pizza and wings are great, the actual food was just okay.  

a steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their pizzas, which was kind of funny.  they have a delivery service, right?  

i would have been happy to order from them again, but today i ordered pizza from wings.  they deliver quickly, and their pizza is out of this world!"

Perfect pizza, always go there! ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like i said i was being sarcastic when i said there wasn't many salads in montreal. there were only a couple tiny handful on the menu, but those that were on the small end of things were good. the large end was just okay it wasn't bad.

i'll be back when i'm in town and try to recreate that excellent thin crust pizza. the only problem was how hard it was to make a 4 inch pizza from scratch.

i think the large half is just okay it's best eaten with a fork.

every one needs to go here!

it's a good place! the pizza is good! the salad is great! the service

Perfect pizza that you can customize to your exact specifications. one piece of my daughter's favorite was the pepperoni pizza. she added an egg white to it but i just asked because i am a big egg person. another one i enjoyed very much was the fried green pepperoni. the crust was done by hand as well as the filling. i realize that is what sold them but they were done by hand and so on. i will definitely be back until they open an umbrella location in my area. happy to say that is close to opening as well."

pizza is ready by the slice or the phily style.  the pizza is huge - about 8 inches.  i almost never eat pizza here but i always return.  location is great - clear cupcakes and white pizza are my fave.  if you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  super

Perfect pizza. i would order it again (with pepperoni) if i could have it right now. it's in the early stages of development, but it's looking pretty awesome so far! 

the beer selection was eclectic. wine, beer, porter, magic pizza, and the blackberry pie were my favorites. there was also a craft cocktail egg roll, which i actually ate! craft cocktails are definitely good! 

note that they are attentive service, not rude. they also are not push overs, they just do their job.

"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. i really haven't found a pizza i can devote myself to in this area. 

the garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. we really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in.

Fresh ingredients, big fat cheesy arugula and an amazing sangria. i am not a soda drinker at all but i love the tractor soda and i wish there was somewhere i could purchase it! the only thing not to like today was how long everything took. it already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food. our food also came out all separate. we got our tacos first, 10 minutes later my bf got his burger and 15
minutes later i got my pizza."

"what a wonderful find! delicious, inventive, hand-crafted food, together with warm & welcoming service in a fun downtown locale. we enjoyed everything we tried, and since there were four of us and we did everything family style, we tried a lot! highlights included the beets & gnudi, the mushroom polenta, the cacio e pepe, the butternut squash agnotti, and the butterscotch dessert. the bacon/onion/egg pizza and crispy pancetta cavatelli were also great. thanks to eric

Fresh ingredients , good price . i would definitely order from here time and time again . if you like thin greasy pizza then go to sal's. if you want the real deal then go to sal's right away. the only reason i am giving them a 5 star rating is because it took them forever to process my transfer from yelp to facebook so i can't really give them 5 stars unless i am able to go back and try it myself. all the other items  i have tried are excellent and the only reason i am giving them a 4 is because they do not accept bitcoin. so for those of you who are wondering no i am not th owner but i am one of his best customers i bet. the only reason i am giving them

Fresh ingredients, but high quality.  there's a reason that every pizza place i've been to has high praise for their service. they are very on point when it comes to their customers and are very friendly.  i would have to say i like the nyc small pizza joint vibe. the place is always filled with hs kids hanging out, laughing, and eating.  my wife and i are big Mets fans and love all the random stuff that goes on during the day.  my only complaint is that the glass of wine is small and i don't know how many people can afford to go back and get a full glass.  i think the place needs a little sprucing up, tidier, and cleaner."

Fresh ingredients, big fat olives, fresh basil, fresh crab, and walnuts. well seasoned with pepper. bacon and apple pie are my fave. next up is the white chapel pizza, and i'll have said it was excellent! now for the bad news. there is no new york style pizza, only the old school style. which is why i am so disappointed. the new york pizza is very hard to make, but not impossible. the only problem was how sparse the cheese was on the crust. i assume that is why there was such a thin layer of cheese.

second time i ate there i added pepperoni to half of my pizza. 

whenever i have a pizza craving i will be coming back

Fresh ingredients, superb service... what's not to like about this place!  we ordered a few apps to share as well as 3 mains.

first time i ate there i ordered the applegate mains, which was a daikon and crispy chicken mix. 

he said that they were great! 

he also said that they were very nice inside, and that they were definitely good. 

he also said that they were very timely, and that they were all gone before another thought came up.  i guess it depends on the week.  if it's been a week or so, i may have missed a few mains.  my husband and i both ordered pizza from there and were sat right

Fresh ingredients and decent price. a HUGE plus for $10.99!!!!
"oh so i guess the yummy pizza is good and i am a sucker for fresh fruits and veggies. what i really liked today was that i could have gotten a fresh mozzarella cheese product for only $2.50!  i realize now why they don't come in all caps because there is a limit on the size of cans you can produce.  my only complaint is that the can is very small. i think it needs bigger holes in it to hold everything together. but i still give it a thumbs up because it is cheaper than buying fresh fruit and veggies.  50 cents for a can of tahitian treat!

the pizza here uses fresh mozzarella cheese which is super yummy.  however, the sauce is so good that i am totally thrilled that a bakery allows them to use tomato sauce instead of using soy sauce which is found in too many pizza restaurants. 

the pizza here is pretty standard, nothing special but decent.  the delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and delivery were in about 5 minutes.  not bad.  the delivery guy was very friendly.  i will be back to have more from you guys.  your pizza is

Fresh ingredients, good price. i also tried the 5-cheese, chicken 5-cheese, mushroom, egg and beef. the 5-cheese was quite good, but the taste of the mains was vinegar.  i wanted to try something new, so i ordered a Mediterranean salad. the owner was very friendly, and even though the menu has been updated a few times, the old-school yummy salad always gives me well-done pasta.  a brand new yummy salad comes with 2 medium eggs, a small can of tuna fish, a medium olives container, a small pepperoni slice, and a fresh cucumber.   it was very tasty, and i expected more from a new york location - why else

"ordered pizza and 8 inch chicken cesar pizza.  the pizza was not only delicious, but also surprisingly fresh. 

the chicken was not overly salty or hot, but rather had a nice flavor.  i especially liked the crispy skin and crunchy crust.  the entire pizza was very tasty, but i preferred the 8 inch to go.  

the price was very reasonable,  making this a winner choice for a variety of reasons.  the delivery guy was very personable, and was very friendly with the delivery person.  i also appreciated his recommendations on future purchases."

"i heard this place was good and it was. i ordered a personal sized cheese pizza with no extra toppings for $7.50. and it was good. they make it like pizza brutta on monroe st, where instead of being covered with a layer of cheese it has a few dollops. few toppings, few balls.  super yummy.

i came here after getting a free pizza at a yelp event.  it's hard to find a yelp event without visiting one, so i was excited to try out!  we arrived at around 11:45 on a saturday and there was plenty of space - the tables were filling up when we were leaving though.  i sat on a large chair opposite the bar, as most of the other patrons would come in to order.  however, i just happened to be looking for a spot to sit down and have a beer when i happened to look up james boys ny style pizza on yelp.  it was a little pricey ($7.50

Fresh ingredients serve a purpose when it comes to pasta.  black olives are great, and so are the few slices of tomato that make it through the grinder.  the crust is chewy and delicious.  in a typical greasy spoon, that is exactly what you would get.  we always used to come here on tuesdays to get the tuesday take out special which apparently stopped. when we called today to go get the usual tuesday deal, the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no. so now that they have taken away my tuesday special i can tell you at this moment

there are really no restaurants like this one. we enjoyed every bite!! from the moment we walked in to the moment we left we had a smile on our face. we also heard the positive reviews on yelp.  so what are they saying? aren't they awesome?  my only complaint is that the Yelp ad they used was taken down soon after it went up so we don't know if they're still accepting new reviews.  if you do review them they should add you to the ever growing list of people who have downloaded their free weekly e-mail newsletter!  so next time you're in cleveland or near cleveland and want to get

Crispy crust and a soft bottom dough, reminiscent of old fashioned pizza. i wish i had taken a picture so you could see the garlic powder coating the pizza crust, which i also added to the mix. in the video i mentioned that the garlic bread tasted amazing, and that is exactly what it was. not only is the garlic bread a favorite of ours, but we also enjoy the dry roasted chicken. a chipotle style built your own bowl or wrap. i prefer the bowl because it has a higher ratio of carbs to calories. also, the gourmet mustard on the side is awesome. lastly, be sure to leave room for the homeless man to use the restroom, as he often will be standing right next to you using the public restroom. last

alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals. the pizza was disappointing, but their homemade hearts are amazing!  my grandmother used to work as a waitress at this restaurant, so i definitely know people who love this pizza! this is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family......we do both :)

this restaurant has a lot going for it.  the atmosphere is nice and it is like stepping away from the busy area just outside its doors.  it was clean and comfortable and very

Crispy crust and a unique combination of cheeses makes up the perfect bbq chicken pizza. the sauce was so good and the family that runs this place seem very nice. if you get pizza from them, you will be happy to know they are always open late night and are a huge wine lover. 

the pizza here is pretty standard. they use whole wheat dough which is great if you are gluten free. the only thing different here is the size of the slice. the bbq chicken pizza is about the size of a small pizza, and the teeny tiny cheddar cheese pizza is just a touch bigger. 

while a 8 inch pizza would not satisfy my husband, it is good for us both.  for dinner,

Crispy crust and a large enough salad to share for $5.75!  i had the salad yesterday and it was very very good!  i had a large pizza with sausages and that was very good!  there was a decent amount of bits of cheese!  my dad had the pizza he said it was very good too!  mom had the pizza she said it was very good too!  dad had the pizza he said it was very good too!  for $5.75!

Crispy crust and double cheesecake are what sold me. 

they also serve up a great many interesting concoctions, most notably, chili garlic bread with hot peppers to it's name. 

cannot complain - definitely one of toronto's finest kept secrets!

Crispy crust and an odd mixture of cheeses.

baloney's is a good place that i highly recommend! the pizza is out of this world and i wish i could have tried every one!! their  pizza is solid ny style pizza!!

they have such good pizza!!  they offer a variety of pizza's.... pizza that's it!  they also serve up a great breakfast shake every morning!!  my only complaint is that their espresso is very strong and the shot is very strong.... hence the reason i am not a fan.  if you are a fan of strong coffee drinks, then you must be visiting this place frequently.  if that is the case, then you must be visiting from out of town or have leftovers

Crispy crust and high quality ingredients. i have had the chicken wrap several times and it is huge and enough for two meals. it is fresh and the service is fast. half way through cooking my pizza they remembered that i only wanted mushrooms on half, so they took it out of the oven and picked them off.  kind of weird, but whatever.  nice gesture, but paws off my pizza! lol."

Crispy crust, this is the kind of food i make reservations for. i'm not a huge pizza lover myself, but damn if i'm not happy about this. the wings are good and crispy and the chicken is crispy and bold and the mozzarella cheese is made tough but not too greasy and they come with a 5-spice dolla. not bad. the owner was very prompt and friendly. highly recommend."

Crispy crust with some sort of peppery seed to it that adds a lot of flavor to it. Not the best pizza ever, not the best i've had, but it's close. i order here all the time and the lines can be long. i assume this is true for the line that follows."
"i absolutely love this place! i moved to the peoria area about 7 months now and i was trying to find that one really good local pizza joint and i finally found it a few months ago! this place has such a unique place, you can have the exact pizza you love and as fresh as possible because it's baked in your own oven. they use fresh ingredients, awesome sauce and it's pretty affordable ply they have this stamp card

Crispy crust helps to mask the sweetness of the sweet potatoes, while the garlic bread and butter are essential flavors to this dish. sautéed mushrooms top it all off, and the potatoes themselves are quite possibly the best thing i've ever eaten.  the sauce is very generous, and i really enjoy the fried egg white portion.  the fried egg white is what sold me, as i was hoping for a fried egg white that actually came from the fryer.  in all, the meal was quite good, and i enjoyed it tremendously.  the owner was very friendly, and even though this is a dive bar, he always gives me well wishes.

Crispy crust and flavorful herbs, this is an awesome italian/chicago style pizza. i wish i had taken a picture so you could see the 2 hour wait time, but it was very clear that the restaurant was busy at all with some tables full and one woman at a desk job making sure everyone was ok. 

the pizza here is pretty standard, nothing special but decent. i assume this is why they are so cheap; quality over quantity. quantity over quality. 

rice, beans, sweet plantains, empanadas, and steak. all were awesome! the steak was nice and hot and had a real sauce flavored chop. i also tried the grilled chicken and it was awesome! the grilled corn was crispy and not too

Crispy crust and double dipping are the hallmarks of this chicken philly. the combination of the spicy diavola sauce, which we experienced first hand, and the crispy chicken along with their excellent garlic bread and butter beans; all along with their  dairy  (they use butter beans instead of corn) and soy milk; all along with their  number one fanciest fanciest fanciest guy - darn near stole this show!

Crispy crust and large amount of them have been converted to crispy mac n' cheez.  the mac n' cheez is a fav.  service is mainstays, but pops up time and time again.  is there really no other pizza joint in town that serves up thick and chewy crusts like this?  my only complaint is that the bottle of wine is small.  i would like to try more dishes, but  my husband said he would be happy to order from this place on again.

Crispy crust helps keep it light, but pop up artichoke leaves are what really make this pizza special.  there is a small kids menu, crayons and a little play area in the corner with some toys and a chalkboard wall.  my girls both had the kids salami pizza and my only complaint is that my waitressing days are behind me so I don't plan on going anytime soon... but hey!  my boys both had the kids asado pizza and both were pleased.  my girls said that they both had a great experience with the delivery lady and that they were treated well.  my boys said that they both had a great experience with the cook and that they were very prompt.  my girls said that they both had

Crispy crust completes the dreamy freshness of the place.  ambrosia pizza and/or calzones are my fave.  there is no other pizza I eat better.  a perfect blend of tastes.  only available in consecutive months, but orders are high and the profit margin on these is very good.  my wife and i both love their pizza, it's huge when it's hot and it's tasty, it's healthiest pizza and we both want kids (he's 5 months and I'm 2 months).  we both want pizza to be greasy, not to mention healthier.

Crispy crust and large enough to share with 3 others. large families/parties need to be aware that this is a little place that only takes cash; therefore, expect to wait a long time for your order. also, be aware that this is a cash only place; you will not be able to pay by check; you will need to make an order in person. 

you will have an awesome meal, promise :)

Crispy crust and a media sample of the fried chicken carried over from my previous visit. i guess that speaks for itself... pizza did not disappoint! the wings were huge and had a smokey sweet bacon flavor. the pizza was around 12 inches and was about medium/thin thickness. it is definitely large enough for one to share depending on appetite. i recommend the stuffed style with the crispy topping and the mac n' cheese. the other items were great as well! will be returning as soon as i come back to town."

Crispy crust and amazing buns!! we were originally planning on staying all day but my hubby had other plans and wanted to get back to his room at around 11:30 so we decided to call it a wrap up call.  not that it stopped us...we ordered 2 xl pizzas, salami and mushrooms and were ready to go when my hubby called!  not bad.  
      other than that my hubby and i had a great meal and really enjoyed the atmosphere. we also appreciated our waiter and his thoughts in items on the menu that were best for us and our time frame.  
      great food and generous portions! what more could you possibly want."

Crispy crust that falls apart in your mouth. not a big deal, i'll never know. my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. not a big deal, all in all. i'll be back."
"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. i really haven't found a pizza i can devote myself to in this area.

Crispy crust. nice and spicy. the meatballs are not the largest in the world, only covered with a thin layer of batter. eggs are also great, and the chicken parm hoagie is delicious. the owner and staff are super friendly. lastly, be sure to leave room for the circus act... usually ends up being me and my cat flipping burgers.  leaving room for the bartenders to do their job is a plus for me.  they do a fantastic job, and are super friendly.  my only complaint is that they are not open that late, so don't be alarmed if you wait for them to open."

Crispy crust covered in a thin layer of sautéed onions and garlic. The base of the pizza is delicious fried egg whites. 

 after that they offer a vegan chili pepperoni pizza  loved it! 
 after that we had the germander, the ballerina, the vamp, and the old fogey.  each one was amazing!  the warm butteriness of the egg whites was delicious.  and the crispy crust paired perfectly with the sweet sauce.  the whole pizza was great!  

overall great pizza.  it's nice to have a place to just relax with good beers and good food locally."
"good pizza, good wings, good restaurant."
"this is a fun place

Crispy crust and large portions. i would also like to mention that they are very nice ladies . they also serve up a great variety of fruity flavored mixed drinks. not to mention the cute little ice cream truck that one can take advantage of during the day. which reminds me - what is it called again?  we will explore that further when we are in the area. happy to say that they have ice cream!

piola's is a very large pizza and wings shop. they also sell soda by the can, tea, gatorade, water and are always nice.

i absolutely love all the coupons they have and their rewards program is awesome.  i would have to say i like the sunny side of piola's.

Crispy crust and strong garlic flavor. the mozzarella cheese was not only delicious, it was also spicy. 

while a 5 star establishment is definitely attainable, if only because it's located next to a long strip ofas you walk in, it's easy to get lost.

Crispy crust, not too greasy and not too salty. really a good choice for a hot dog or two. 

you get a large with a tomato slice, red onion, and you can make this into a full size hot dog as well. 

the sliced tomatoes are what really stood out to me. they were not too sweet or too spicy.  i believe pizza people use half of a small tomato as a topping for their pizza.  the other half is used for the mustard.  in my opinion, half is better than none.  you can make it whatever size you like though.  i did make a few small sisys by asking and they were all right down my street so i guess they are not new

Crispy crust (crispy mozzarella cheese and parmesan) and wonderful nuttiness.  if you like thin greasy pizza, go elsewhere.  my greasy pizza was not very greasy, and i definitely did not have a dry fry.  

i will be back; it was very good pizza!

service was great - attentive, polite, friendly.

this is a great place for large families/parties wanting a greasy pizza that will not break the bank, or for when you are out doing errands and crave some greasy pizza...we do both!"

Crispy crust and almost no chicken fat.  this place has a lot going for it, but a simple ask can pay for itself in a hurry.  there is plenty of parking and you can bike there yourself if you want."

Crispy crust with an amazing blend of cheeses. i am not a real pizza lover so i have searched the web for the best pizza but have so far failed to come across a recipe that adequately describes our pizza. that being said great pizza!! this is a great Friday night get together for up and coming pizza heads or people of all ages looking for a nice slice of the action. we do have pizza on the chain so expect pizza here on friday.

i got a slice of their white chapel pizza and i was intrigued by the pepperoni slice. there is a strong tradition in the pizza making family of originating from michigan, where i was born and raised.

Crispy crust, i need to say that quite frankly i am amazed by how well this holds together.  the slices are enormous, and i really like the crisp yet chewy part.  a side order of yogurt...mmmm.  $8.95 for a 16 inch pizza, which is a good deal for just pizza.  delivery was right in the timeframe they provided, and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and delivery were hot on arrival and the delivery man was very friendly.  my only complaint at this time is that the glass of wine is small. i don't know what their pour is but it is the only thing not generously given.  i expect to be giving that slice to a friend soon enough and i will be back

Crispy crust and an almost aesthetic similarity to pizza puff. 

the seeds are perfectly cooked and the fat is...well, you'll just have to try it yourself.  I mean, you could always ask your server for extra crispy chicken or mushrooms.  my only complaint is that there are no detailed serving menus.  you order the meal in, then you'll have time to try some of the specialty items on the menu."

Crispy crust and a large egg on top! i definitely got the most out of my visit when i mentioned that my dad also worked as a restaurant server.  he was polite, but said that he enjoyed every bite!!  i also asked if there was a lunch special because i felt like there was some type of age limit on the food. he replied that there was no age limit on the food, but that there was a small salad given to the servers.  i asked if there was a 4- to 6-month old, and if so, when he ate that, he got a generous portion of toasted crostini.  my dad also shared that he loved the pizza, but i think the ratio of the ingredients was good.

The pizza was fantastic! i ordered a salad yesterday to take away and it was delivered in 45 minutes. the salad was big for a small salad; it came with lots of caramelized onions, walnuts and fresh goat cheese.  my husband ordered a few slices of his pizza to take home and it was also great! they really know how to serve a good pizza. :)"

The pizza was fantastic! i ordered a salad yesterday to take away. (vegan) my fav thing to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at cinema du parc. they stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly.

you will have an awesome meal, promise :)"
my boyfriend and i came in here for the first time for dinner. i had lasagna and my boyfriend had the waiter by the name of jared build him a pizza it was a pizza that featured a crispy crust and they said it was quite possibly the best pizza they had ever made. the staff is super friendly and was very understanding of what was being said. the only thing i didn't like

the website is pretty straightforward, but the phone number that went to place an order was disconnected.

this place has a lot going for it, and it shows in the menu. 

    personally, i'm thrilled that they've fixed the delivery glitch so quickly, but it's not like they've stopped delivering to my location either.  there's always been a wait for my pizza, and it usually is a couple days after my order is placed.  which is why i'm leaving a review, because it's really easy to give a pizza away if you don't want it to get judged negatively.  if you are ever in the vicinity

"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the $6 large greasy pizza is a nice deal, and i do admit the flavor is marginally better than caesar's $5 greasy pizza. the only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking wet from being drenched in oil. 

alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals. the pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! it's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh

the homemade (i think that's how they spell it) hot dogs are the best thing i have ever eaten.  they are not like those  you get at all.  they are the real deal, and i am not exaggerating

The pizza was fantastic - thick and delicious along with friendly service. i would definitely return - maybe for a run on Friday night too."
"ordered sushi pizza, sashimi pizza, and octopus pizza.  the service was great and the pizza was great!  i had a client in the 90's and i can tell you that alot of people go there on a daily basis.  we just needed one thing to hit the spot!  my only complaint is that the pizza was extremely late for delivery.  i expect delivery to be very fast.  i live just a couple blocks away and there is plenty of parking.  

every one needs to go here! it's a great for after dinner socializing with some family and/or
^
The pizza was fantastic!!  not a lot of seating area indoors. staff is super friendly.  tryst be near me and u will be good friends lol. 

my fav thing to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at cinema du parc. they stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly.

you will have an awesome meal, promise :)"
my boyfriend and i came in here for the first time for dinner. i had lasagna and my boyfriend had the waiter by the name of jared build him a pizza it was very good and we had chicken wings. the restaurant was very clean but it felt a little warm in here. i would recommend this

The pizza was fantastic!!  the mozzarella and parmesan was amazing!  i also had the green chili beef sandwich, which of course was wonderful!  

overall, great place to get pizzas!!  good service, and  nice atmosphere."
"i would give this spot 10 stars if i could. it's been my family for many generations, and the only reason i wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it's the size of a small town pizza. i would give it a 7 because it's nice to have a place to just relax with good beers and good food locally."
"the place doesn't look the best but food is excellent and the service is fantastic!  my husband always gets pizza or open face

The pizza was fantastic!! the mozzarella appetizers and the chicken and waffles were my favorites.  there was a 6 in. skillet left over  which was a little unusual but enjoyed it greatly.  the staff is super friendly!! we will definitely be back!!"
"always searching for a lunch deal - that's me. 

lunch special - any pizza at 6 inch size with any small salad for $6.99. that is a good deal when the pizza is truly handmade with fresh mozz.

i counted 13 slices of pizza in here. that is a good deal when the pizza is truly handmade with fresh mozz.

i chose the housemade spicy sausage pizza and the arugula salad. crust was thin

The pizza was fantastic. the combination of the pizza, fresh mozzarella, parmesan and salami was what set this place apart.  the pepperoni pizza was not a negative statement as it was delicious ! overall great place. 4 stars instead of 5 because of location size. it could be so much more if moved to a larger location. but, start small and grow super pizza bros."
"excellent pizza ! now i wish i could give them a 5-star rating but they seem very nice maintaining a respectful business approach throughout the years. their pizza is always fresh and they make sure you are satisfied. my only complaint is that the glass of wine is small. i don't know what their pour is but it is the only thing not

The pizza was fantastic! very tasty! but the price was the best part! we had water, fries, and  everything - great service, and they loved our water buffalo wings! water buffalo is a water buffalo specialty!

i went there for the first time, and i must say, i was quite impressed. there are a few different pizza chains in mediterranean, but this one always gives me well made

The pizza was fantastic! i am a huge fan of the hot cookies though. any salad you want, it's good. the service is wonderful...which is kind of important. 1 star all the way!"

always walk in here for a slice and a pop when i'm in the neighbourhood. service is good and quick. pizza is awesome! large families/parties need to be aware that this restaurant has a good selection of pizza. quality is high. large families need to be aware that some pizza is really good.

price: high, but it's the best pizza i've had in montreal. best to walk a mile to get pizza.

"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. i really haven't found a pizza i can devote myself to in this area. 

the garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. we really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in. very tasty pepperoni and parmesan recipe.

The pizza was fantastic and i'll be posting pictures of it too. it was covered with a kind of spicy green pepperoni sauce that i couldn't help but add some to my pizza. it was amazing! the green pepperoni was so delicious! and then we had the bread appetizers, which was quite an amusing sight. we took half home because i really need to improve my eating habits, and because it was all i was having and i wanted to be authentic to the area. 

i'll be honest, the whole experience has been quite the opposite of expected. i expected people to be friendly, and i enjoyed some drinks with them.  they also seemed very organized.  sort of food-like, but not overly so.

The pizza was fantastic! i had a couple of deep dish pizzas, a gluten free pizza, a salad, some wings, and the cheese curds. the mama mia was great too! i love the off the hook attitude of the delivery man. he is always nice and the pizza is always hot and fresh. the beer was ice cold when it arrived but quickly became cold and crystal clear with a fork.  my only complaint is that the beer selection on the menu is very limited.  i have had many beers on draft and very few that were by far the best beers i have had in the area.  i would like to try some of the specialty beers but the menu says they are only available as two-liter bottles.  that is

best pizza in the area by far. one of the best i've ever had. the seafood pizza is absolutely amazing. great service and they go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.  so for everyone who said they had an unpleasent experience next time open your mouth and say something or don't complain. unfortunately we know

The pizza was fantastic! i ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like i was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza i was going to consume.

(shouting "hi there, how are you doing today?") 

i know it's weird. lol i thought of asking them to make a vegan margherita pizza, but i think they looked more like they were serving up some sort of sweetened condensed milk, so i stuck with the pizza. 

i ordered from here and it was a medium pizza. i don't know

The pizza was fantastic!! the green chili gringo hand pie is amazeballs!! i would order from here again and/or from the site's e-commerce page. 

las vegas was my favorite , playing a lot of video games growing up. i played choo choo on my pager, ate pizza at the office, and went to the movies with my dad.  cant complain!!  all pizza is homemade, non-GMO, and KIND.  i was also pleased to learn that the restaurant has been around for 37 years!  only problem is that it's very hard to find, and they seem to be remodeling their space all the time!"

i will be back when i am in the area and will be posting frequently here on how great this place is!!

The pizza was fantastic!  the \"ground beef tonkwe\" was the type of beef you get when you order the regular-crust.  i also tried the larger variety of pizza, the turkey pita, and the big fried dough.  the chicken mixture was also great!  there is a nice selection of coffees, tea, and beers.  i have had the chocolate chip, white chocolate, and vanilla varieties.  the white chocolate is just disappointing.  i would really like to try the coffee au lait.  it is different every time.  there is a nice touch of roast coffee.  i also tried the amazingly delicious white sauce.  the fried dough was also very good!

The pizza was fantastic! had i mentioned that? no, i am not exaggerating. great crust, great cheese, and the best sauce ever. also, the service picking up the food was excellent. nice and warm. (i live in cleveland, so i can't say much about cleveland but their pizza is very good)

i will say that the butterscotch dessert was delicious. i think this might have been the best i have ever had. the molasses cookie was not overly sweet nor did i experience any food allergies. my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the smaller the better. also ask for the spicy oil. that adds a lot of flavor to it.

"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the 70's era diner here is pretty darn good. the only reason i would not give it a 5 star rating was that there was no under 30oz. can you imagine how hard it would be to eat that much food with just one hand? i don't know what the under 30oz. limit is on this place, maybe it was the age of the servers, or maybe it was the fact that there was only 1 or 2 nickels and dimes in the dispensing machine, but the place just kept dispensing the food. still

we'll be back when we're in

The pizza was fantastic! i ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like i was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza i was going to consume. the farmer's salad was interesting as i'd heard mixed reviews on it but decided to give it a try as a side dish. the feta in the mediterranean salad is super yummy, though on the salty side.

i went there again today, after ordering delivery yesterday. i don't plan on going tomorrow but we will see."
staff is always nice and their pizza is awesome! the wings are good too! and so many other things! great place to get pizzas!

The pizza was fantastic! the ratio of the ingredients was very good. i ordered a large supreme pizza and it came with a really large hot pepperoni slice, lots of hot peppers, and an extremely large amount of chopped garlic. (he said he didn't like large slices of garlic, but i just looked like i was giving him space). he also said that the pizza was really good, so good i might have liked it had i known what kind of pizza it was. 

overall, great experience. glad i made a Yelp search first thing instead of going there myself. also, huge shout out to the women at the pizza counter who were extremely polite and friendly. my only complaint is that the men seem to be getting older. i know they

the garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. we really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in. very tasty pepperoni and parmesan recipe. 

the regular crust pizza we ordered for carry out next time was pretty good too, but not as good as the thin.

The pizza was fantastic! i had a couple of deep dish pizzas, a gluten free pizza, and an apple cinnamon cookie. the fish tacos were interesting as they had a fried egg over top which i really liked. they come with a lot of sausages which i did not say anything negative about.

we will definitely be back!"

"i really enjoyed this restaurant. in fact, i went there twice during my stay. mostly for the pizza. i had a fig and artichoke pizza, and added spinach. it was so delicious! it was also very convenient because it was right next to the gel action plaza. a cupcake truck would have been nice.

the specialty cocktails were very expensive for drinks. my friends had a mango

i want to say my wife and i were fairly positive you guys would give us a try. well, we did just that! we ordered a pizza and an order of fried chicken. the pizza was a little heavy for our liking, but we nonetheless ate the whole thing! :)

The pizza was fantastic!  loved the green chili cheese.  service was wonderful.  both the girls working were polite and helpful.

"good size pizza, no mystery!  place filled quickly and accurately with pizza toppings.  not overly sweet or vinegar-based, but rather tomato-based.  which was most apparent on the pizza, which had some sort of mushroom sauce.  sort of reminds me of pizza hut in virginia.  i would have to say my expectations have been exceeded, but i'll be back.  location is good, menu offers a great selection, and prices are reasonable.  good place to get pizzas, great service."

The pizza was fantastic! i am not a pizza enthusiast, but this place warrants a visit.  there is a reason that every crop of mcgill students learns of this place and quickly sees it as a staple.  it is their ""special treat"" pizza that they order whenever they are in town.  we are not crazy about them, but we will continue to go back because it is the only pizza place that treats its pizza like a champ.  

this place has a lot going for it.  the atmosphere inside is nice and it is like stepping away from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area.  it was clean and comfortable and very relaxing.  the service was great and our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu."

The pizza was fantastic!  great sauce, amazing crust.  loved the ""check in"" on facebook and get an order of chicken and waffles for only $2.99.  delivery was right there when I got there and it was ready when i arrived home.  

the sauce was so good!  added chicken to half of my ""pop up"" pizza and it was amazing!  it tasted like cardboard bowl pizza.  was a little pricey but worth it because of the aw yissss."

The pizza was fantastic!!!  they have real pepperoni,  a chipotle style stood by itself was amazing and  the wings were good.  

the xl pizza was huge and had a cookie sheet in the crust.  i cut it up and it was very tasty.  there was a decent amount of people in there so be prepared.  i also tried the big apple pizza,  which is just spicy pepperoni.  this was also tasty.

overall, great place to get pizzas.  the staff is very nice and friendly to their customers.  i would definitely come back!"
i love the idea and execution of custom made pizzas.  the pizza was delicious and it was ready in less than 5 minutes

The pizza was fantastic! the combination of the tasty crust, the right amount of sauce and a fresh mozzarella along with quality toppings makes it the best pizza i've had in arcadia area. it was also quite affordable. 

what i liked about this place the most is that they are constantly updating their menu... it was very busy at all and everyone was fussy about what they ordered but us three just sat back and enjoyed the wait. 

second time i ate there i ordered a pepporoni slice, which was spicy but tasted really good. 

feels like home."

The pizza was fantastic! i ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like i was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza i was going to consume. they give a good amount of salad! the feta in the mediterranean salad is super yummy! having never eaten feta, i was somewhat skeptical when my dad told me it was very good.  he said he had a hard time believing it was 6 months old, but he loved it!  i think the only reason i am giving it less than 5 stars is because it stated they were out of stock on the tomatoes, which i actually ordered.  which they do not have, they use canned instead.

"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the $5 large pizza is a nice deal, and i do admit the flavor is marginally better than caesar's $5 large pizza. the only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking wet from being drenched in oil. 

alexander's pizza also serves up some seriously good pizza! this was our ""special"" pizza, and we ate a delicious homemade blue cheese pizza and a huge salad. the blue cheese was interesting as i wasn't entirely sure what it was called...probably makes you think cheese toast is weird,

The pizza was fantastic! very local and awesome! their pizza is solid when it comes to quality and price. they also are really cheap because they use food stamps. 

the florentine pizza with artichoke hearts and spinach is also good! this is why i am a fan! the service is nice and italian-style... i think this is where the name came from? 

the only reason i would not give it a 5 star rating was that the pizza was too hard to make a 5-star pizza out of. but i gave it a 4 because of the service! 

i will be back when i am in the area and will be posting pictures of the pizza i have made so far! :)"

^
The pizza was fantastic!  real pizza, not the hot opener.  half the family were there for the pizza and the other half for the turkey.  real turkey pizza, not the one we got at the gas station.  i think the family enjoyed their pizza more because of the composition of the ingredients.  there was a good amount of turkey chunks.  my dad had a few slices of the pepperoni and he said that he was very good.  

i also tried the big apple pizza, which is just spicy pepperoni.  my mom had a different slice of the pepperoni that she had in mind when she said that she was very good.  my dad said that he had no complaints.

The pepperoni pizza that i had before that tasted really good. 

overall, great place to get pizzas.  good service, and they seem to doing a good business as a lot of people walk in to pick up their pizzas.  one time they forgot to take a picture of the pizza because it was delivered in another location.  if you look carefully, you can see that the pizza crust is being cooked at the moment.  i assume that the chicken and waffles are also being cooked.  if you get a pizza here, you will want to ask the server for a salad or two.  you will want to try those too."

^
The pepperoni pizza i had for breakfast yesterday was the best ever!  my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers.   other than that, great service!  everything was great!  yummy and the marriage of a cuppa and a coffee shop is very fitting.  we will explore other items they offer in the future!"

The pepperoni pizza and 1 up close and personal...seriously, i am not exaggerating. raw, unadulterated garlic flavor rides on top of the pizza's amazing blend of cheeses, which includes sun dried tomatoes, black olives, and sweet corn. to finish things off, we got the requisite fried egg scalding. out of nowhere, this place delivered a hot  fried egg to our table!  i can't say enough good things about hot  eggs. they are fast, friendly, and the price doesn't make you feel like you are back in california. they are the type of people who are always happy to help others, and they are very responsive when you call in a question.  for those of you

The pepperoni pizza i had yesterday, which had a sauce base of pepperoni, was a little strange.  it has a sauce base that is actually great!

The pepperoni pizza that i had was a perfect cross between roast beef and crispy skin. very tasty indeed, and would definitely recommend! 

the only negative review i can give is that i don't know what the fill is because it's been so long since my last visit. if you want to know the truth, then you need to order from the restaurant. but if you just want to know what it's like to eat there, then you can just ask. 

i know it's weird.

The pepperoni pizza i am about to share is not the most hygienic looking pizza, but it is the first time i have had food poisoning from eating pizza there.  therefore i was not prepared, but i have eaten there countless times and it is very rare that i have to take any medicine.  the pizza here is very thin crust, so do be aware of that.  the slices are large and there are usually several pies to choose  from.   they are always nice and fresh, and the staff is very friendly.  be sure to ask for the free hot peppers olive oil mix...mmm!  place has a lot going for it, but it is inexpensive and convenient transportation for my wife and i."
"loved this
^
The pepperoni pizza that i had in my opinion has a good amount of sauce. i also tried the madrone, meat lovers, and the butternut squash soup. the squash is what sold me and my husband. they also provide a decent amount of pasta. very good. service was good. and the pizza was excellent."
"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. i really haven't found a pizza i can devote myself to in this area. 

the garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. we really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in. very tasty pepper

The pepperoni pizza which came with a really spicy sausage.  was not a bad choice.  

overall, great place to get pizzas.  the staff is very nice and friendly to their customers.  i would definitely come back!"
i love the idea and execution of custom made pizzas.  the pizza was delicious and it was ready in less than 5 minutes.  i am a fan of this place and will be back.  the place is cool and happy.
we love their margarita pizza!  their delivery service is always fast and their food is amazing.  highly recommend!
"decided to eat here again because i was craving the cheesy deliciousness and received a coupon in the mail for $10 off

The pepperoni pizza was not only tasty, it was also of the highest quality.  the fit and finish was excellent.  the only reason i would not give it a 5 star rating was that they were out of three of the pizza toppings i tested.  that is easily remedied if you ordered from us.  a small tip i will offer is to ask if you can pay by taking a picture of the pizza with your phone before you eat it.  you will have an option to pay by texting ME the amount you will pay for toppings.  

if you are looking for a tasty break from the normal pizza, try a thin crust chicken + jalapeno... i prefer this over the usual cheese pizza because it has more

The pepperoni pizza I had on Sunday was a nice side dish with really good sauce.  i really enjoyed it and am looking forward to trying some of their chicken and waffles.  there is a reason that every bakery in this country is closed on sundays.  there is no Saturday night meal.  what is sad is that the only employees that work that night are the ones that make the pizza.  so instead of having a nice family style dinner with the kids, i am having dinner with my wife and she is a huge pizza lover.  we have been here on sundays since it opened and are happy to say we are the only ones who like to go back!  we usually go back when we are in the area cause it's so
^
The pepperoni pizza i had was a perfect blend of spicy and sweet.  there was a thin layer of cheese on the bottom which i definitely liked.  the pepperoni is what sold me and i realize now that they have no specials that i can see, that is what sold me.  they seem to be fairly busy at the moment, but tomorrow i will be back and recommending them to everyone i know!"

The pepperoni pizza I had last night was a perfect blend of spicy hot and fresh.  not only that, but they serve a killer chicken parm hoagie.  i know it's weird.  but i eat chicken all the time and it never gets old being served in a pizza cole.  all the other food i have tried is good but the pizza is the real star.  a rare gem in this city!!
it's a great neighbor place. the pizza is great. the salads are airways fresh and the chicken fingers are delicious! always friendly and fast service.

good ny pizza. 
fast. 
good selection of slices with cool toppings. 
easy to stop in

The pepperoni pizza I had yesterday was a perfect blend of pepperoni, mmmm and did i mentioned the mozzarella cheese.  my only complaint would be that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers.  i actually like the stronger pepperoni flavor better, but you could always try the milder variants if you wanted to spice it up a bit.  my take on the day was very positive and delicious!  

overall, great place to get pizzas or i would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good pizza in the mid west valley."

^
The pepperoni pizza was not the only one that stood out. we also had the mozzarella cheese fondue, which of course was amazing.  the lady behind the register was very friendly, and even though there is a capricious element to pizza, she always gives us a good toss.  that being said, we expected it and were sat right away.  take away a giant slice for only $2.75!  

piola pizza is very very good.  they have extensive taste tests, and are constantly adding toppings to make sure it is up to par with the pizza we enjoy in montreal.  the hot peppers are very good.  the mozzarella cheese is not to thick for me, but rather generous

The pepperoni pizza i had was also quite good. many thumbs up kinds of people on yelp! service was good.

"solid pizza. maybe slightly on the rich side but sometimes that's what you're looking for! got the date/juliet/vuitton/granite/granite/date combo. i really liked the crisp yet chewy crust. they offer a variety of locally roasted coffees,  asado's, and pastas.  my speciality is the espresso...mmmm!  price was very good, cheaper than
^
The pepperoni pizza i had was delicious!  however, the service was very fast and friendly, probably because of the size of the pizza.  i also tried the 7 year old's pizza, which was not only delicious, but the service was very friendly.  all in all, the experience was very good.  

next time i'm in cleveland, i'll definitely stop back in. i may even be coming for dinner today."

^
The pepperoni pizza I had was amazing! the sauce was not at all heavy or saucepolitan like you'd expect from reading the tin.  instead, they sautéed the onions and garlic and added a small amount of chicken stock.  this was very good and had a nice flavor.  the pepperoni is what sold me and my husband.  we will be back when we are in the area.  

overall, great place to get pizzas or to just relax and enjoy the atmosphere.  the staff is very nice and friendly to their customers.  i would definitely come back!"

The pepperoni pizza was not a bad choice.  the sauce was not on the thick side.   the shishito peppers were not too harsh on the taste.  overall, the shishito tasted good.

The pepperoni pizza was not a negative hit.  the xl pizza was extremely full of pepperoni,  giving it a little chewier taste.   it was not unpleasant to eat.  one of my favorites was the xl cheese pizza with spicy salami.   other than that, the pizza was great.  it was not overly sweet or starchy,  rather flavorful.  there was a good amount of garlic bread.  that was also not overwhelming.  one of my favorite things to do is to ask them to make me a pizza based on the menu that is posted online.  you won't be disappointed."

The pepperoni pizza i had in my pie was a perfect balance of sweet and cheddar cheese. very tasty. i also had chicken parm hoagie, mushroom, and green pepper.  a delicious dish best eaten with a glass of wine.  my husband had a cheesecake which was not only delicious, but also had hot cocoa (i don't know that it was canned, but it was said to be very good).  my daughter had a mango mohito, and said it was very good.  my grandson had a mango mohito, and said he liked it better than cheesecake.  
      my husband had a cheese pizza he really liked, and we had a mango mohito the next day
^
The pepperoni pizza I had earlier in the morning was placed on hold as i waited for the tram to come through. the queue for the tram was short and I was able to sit back and enjoy the meal. my favourite meal was the chicken waffles with ice cream. very tasty indeed, but the pizza was firm and not overly thick or thin.  i know it's weird, but ice cream on the weekends is what drew me.  my only complaint is that the pizza here is pretty expensive.  i expect to pay more for slices and service.  all in all the pizza here is good, affordable and tasty.  a real go-to for waffles in the area.  

cheers!"
"awesome place. visited
^
The pepperoni pizza i had yesterday was more of an average of what you get in the bar. not a bad drink. for a bar size, it was nice. a steady stream of people came in and ordered pizza. the pizza was ready by the time i got there and was a pretty penny for what they charged. no one here but that one guy so i will go by street.

it says they have the best pizza in montreal. what they lack in pizzazz, they make up for in quality of their ingredients. 

their pizza is always good, and they seem to be adding some new ones fer sure. 

on second thought, maybe i'll come back.  bar doesn't look great, but it was still

The pepperoni pizza we had ordered earlier that day had just come off the truck from the oven.  it was smaller than the pizza we were going to have but it was still delicious.  the pepperoni pizza we ordered for the sandwich was a generous portion with a delicious sourdough crust.  The chicken parm hoagie was not only wonderful but it was also generous.  i plan to be back when i am in the area and will be back to try some of their seafood, pasta dishes.  my husband also loves their frank's chicken sandwich which has pork in it.  my boys both had the pork sandwiches they asked for and they said that was delicious.  

overall great place to get together with friends to enjoy some

The pepperoni pizza came with a really large pepperoni slice and met the criteria of being very spicy indeed.  i definitely would come back!  the place is nice and it was bright and welcoming, which is what drew me.  i will definitely come back!

The pepperoni pizza tasted just like pizza in  new york .  a very good pizza in my opinion.  there was a good amount of mushroom... i would have to try more but the pizza was very good.  my dad had a different pizza but it was good as well.  my mom had a pasta dinner and it was very good as well.  

will definitely order from here time and time again.  new york is a great place to get together with friends or for a couple hundred bucks more.  you get a good pizza, you get the pizza you love, you don't get burned out from the pizza burning.

The pepperoni pizza we had when we dined in had a nice flavor. not the sharpest orburrito puff, but it had a good amount of sauce. not the pot roast variety, but it had a good amount of sauce. the parmesan was not like you get in the us.  it had some sort of meat flavor to it. wings were also good.  a nice touch, but not required.  you can make your own pizza by putting the pizza dough in the microwave.  there was a good amount of sauce.

The pepperoni pizza i had was delicious also. service was great. ordered pizza and 8pc chicken combo. 4pc chicken was not bad. other than that the review is subjective but my only complaint is that the glass of wine is small. i am normally fine with that but it came with a generous portion of toasted crostini. can't complain."

The pepperoni pizza i had when i was 16 months old was the best pizza i have ever eaten.  the combination of the salty crust, the lightly sweetened condensed milk in the hot water and the partially digested meatiness of the tomato sauce is what makes this is the best pizza i have ever eaten.  there was more portion for the same price.  a generous portion of tomato sauce was also on the side.  that bitter store bought parmesan that comes with the crust is what got me through 6 months in captivity.  the family that runs this place seem very nice, so if you are ever in cleveland, you should definitely stop by and try this place!

The pepperoni pizza i had in my hand wasnt too hot and i know many people love to have their pizza hot and fresh all day long.  more precisely, their pizza is really good.  the pepperoni pizza is really spicy and needs to be broken up into small pieces so that its not overwhelming.  the small pieces of pizza are very good and i will be back."
"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. i really haven't found a pizza i can devote myself to in this area. 

the garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. we really enjoyed the thin crust pizza

The pepperoni pizza i had for breakfast yesterday was a perfect blend of pepperoni, sausage, and garlic breading.  it was smeared with a sort of garlic sauce that was kind of garlicky.  overall, it was very good.  for $5-6 bucks, it's a good deal.  

you get a pizza with three items and an hour wait time.  that is a small pizza.  you can buy that pizza here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ceqwpwhboaxwrcv5btnv6g?select=zg2bak39zop7m6bmzmaf7q#tqe5lahn7sp

The pepperoni pizza with sausage on it was very good.  the mint go here is another favorite of ours.  this one is a good for after dinner conversation piece.  for some reason or another, my date and i decided to stop by.  we ordered a salad and enjoyed it immediately.  

i would have given this spot 10 stars if my review weren't so long and detailed... :)

...and if my review weren't so long and detailed... :) 

this is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family.  it's located off a ravioli place so expect all kinds of people there.  price is good, it's a great spot to bring the whole family, and the amb

The pepperoni pizza i had for breakfast was delicious-thin and crispy crust cooked perfectly, not burned. i also had the duck piolaaiyus, mushroom flatbread, and the garbanzo bean burger. each one was great!  there was a decent amount of portions of food!  i will be back when i am in the area.  my husband said that they were great too!  

cannot wait to go back!"

The pepperoni pizza and i had such an amazing experience!  the service was great and the atmosphere was very pleasant.  i would definitely come back!  

"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza.  that's not to say that all the pizza is bad, but the ratio of the ingredients is good.  the sauce is not to thick or thick and suits us well.  it has a good flavor.  

the customer service here is excellent.  every time i go i get a different response.  they always seem to be happy.  on this visit they were very quick

The pepperoni pizza i had previously sent was a 9 in the microwave but it came with a generous portion of roasted garlic, which i admittedly did not heat up.  therefore, i was somewhat reticent to try a 12 in the crust.  however, my husband ordered a sandwich earlier in the morning and was told it came with tomato slices, cucumber, and egg.  in my previous reviews i had mentioned that the restaurant was very clean but this time i was more reticent to say the least.  although the restaurant is on the low end for a bar/club it was still very friendly.  

i will be back; it was clean and fast.  my husband said he enjoyed his meal and is planning on returning when he is

The pepperoni pizza I had on point was not only delicious, it was topped with hot peppers and onions!  a refreshing change from the typical pizza pepperoni.  being able to play video games while you wait for your order is what makes this place so unique.  customers are not served food until they are ready and are treated to a friendly staff.  ambiance is trendy and it was a hit!  greatly recommend!

The pepperoni pizza I had with avocados beans and sweet potato was very good.  a little pricey but we had a good deal.  i also had the cheese pizza with parmesan and it was very good.  one of my fav things to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at cinema du parc.  very chill.

lastly, my favourite is the pizza that has spinach, artichoke, and heirloom tomatoes.  my only complaint is that the pizza needs to be greased more often than the pizza itself.  that is easily remedied by adding some melted butter to the pizza crust.

lastly, i wanted to take a picture of the pizza and how it came out. the

The pepperoni pizza was not the only pepperoni we had but it was one that stood out to us.  there was a good amount of chunks of cheese on the pizza.  i also needed to portion it out thinly so that more people could enjoy it.  i ended up throwing everything out because i realized that the oven wasn't even heated up when i was leaving but rather it was sitting there on the burner when i arrived.  in the mean time i ate a very large pepperoni pizza which was also quite good.  the wings on the other hand were very good.  they were also very small."

this was my fave pizza so far.  the delivery was right around noon and not too busy.  i got a slice of their white chapel pizza which was very good.  they have a wide variety of pizza, white chapel being their speciality.  i got a slice of their bitcoin pizza which was just fine.  they accept all kinds of payment methods.  i got a slice of their chicken pizza which was also quite good.  they have a good selection of slices, price is very good.  

the pizza here is pretty standard.  they also serve up a decent amount of drinkrees.

Huge pizza slices with amazing fresh ingredients! not something i come across too often but boy are the pizza's good. large families/parties need to be aware of their surroundings and be aware of their food. also be aware of the price.  people here assume they are cash only so be prepared to wait a long time for a change.  8 months now and i have never seen anyone withdraw their $5.00!! that is some shady business gonna be doing here. be respectful and happy to be around people who are just getting started in the game!!!!"

lovely place off the beaten path, drive up and have yourself a delicious meal. if you like thin greasy pizza, then a thin crust is good for you. the greasy spuds that came with the salad were very very good. i prefer the thick to thin split but there are always leaveovers. i am not a huge pizza lover myself but the greasy pizza here on earth takes precedence over the sweet. 

the owner asked me if i like thick or thin crust pizza. my answer was simple; it depends on the size of pizza you order.

we got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. i was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. i was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in sautéed onions, but wow were they good. seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in

Huge pizza slices and the like, all for just me and my husband. i wish i had taken a picture so you could see the lady in the kitchen, but she waved me through so i ate the pizza slice by slice. my husband also said that they are very nice in there too.

be sure to ask for the free hot peppers olive oil mix...mmm!  the pizza here is quick and easy, making it ideal for on-line ordering.  

the free hot peppers olive oil mix is divided into three equal parts; chili, oregano and coriander.  each part is great!  to save time ask for a pizza that is just for me and i will happily continue to go back!

"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and i do admit the flavor is marginally better than caesar's $5 pizza. the only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking wet from being drenched in oil. 

alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals. the pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! it's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads.

not sure why all the bad reviews. i've been ordering pizza from this location for a decade and have never had a problem.
great pizza but lacks consistency. lots of toppings to choose

Huge pizza slices and i thought they were ice-cold. quite possibly the best pizza i have ever eaten. covered in spicy jalapenos, it was amazing. the slices are enormous and the aroma in the apartment is extremely welcoming. 

the pizza here is consistent with the nearby brew pub. the pizza is thin, crispy crust and often calls for extra sauce. the call me crazy, but i think extra sauce adds a lot of flavor to the entire pizza.

Huge pizza slices and i thought they were large. they were generous but it was all about the sauce. i ordered a personal sized (i was craving it right know) and it came with a generous portion of toasted sesame seeds.  add to that a generous portion of crispy fried chicken and you've basically got the perfect stoner pizza.  my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. not a big deal, really.

so, what is it exactly that they have that makes them different? well...they have the best wedding soup in montreal. 

i am not a big wine drinker myself but, when i say they have the best wedding soup in montreal, i really mean it.  they use fresh ingredients, awesome broth, and they

Huge pizza slices and one of my fav things is to ask them to add tomato slices...seriously...i think adding tomato slices to a pizza is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. the slices are enormous and i really like the crisp yet chewy crust. dare i say i like it better than secret pizza, a vegas joint on the strip that also has ny style pizza? what they have on this place is location, but pop up pizza is cheaper, faster, and equally (if not more) delicious.

Yummy pizza and wings! seriously the only way to describe this pizza is amazing. i am not a fan of yellowtail pizza because it portrays too many large large people on the site, but this is the only way i can properly describe it. large families/parties need to realize that places that have just opened are going to be super busy and have long wait times, so be prepared! my group of 4 ordered a few apps to share as well as 3 mains.
the highlights were the antipasto della casa, margherita pizza and agnolotti. i also need to mention how delicious the tiramisu was - and i'm not a chocolate cake kinda girl!
service was also phenomenal - we can't wait

i also looked at the menu that they have on the top right hand side. it says a lot about them that they are so nice and their business is booming.  i ended up getting a slice of their white chapel pizza which was pretty awesome. they have a lot of verticals and it was refreshing to see them grow.  my husband said that they were very nice

Yummy pizza!! and a special order of their garlic knots. the pizza was amazing!! i would also like to try the marshmallows  yummy!! they are only available as a small, so for me to try them as a kid would be a great treat! the family that runs this place seem very nice, so if you are a kid on sunday, why not treat yourself to a slice of pizza and a soda?

"good thin crust pizza. we had the dough knots as an appetizer, the 10-inch popeye pie for dinner and took home a slice of the italian creme cake. can't complain -- all was tasty. best part? the price. the cake was somewhat of a splurge ($6.50, but the slice is huge) - otherwise, it would have been a $12 dinner for two.

Yummy pizza and salad. i also had the cheese bread appetizer, mushroom flatbread, and lastly, the butterscotch dessert. the middle eastern pizza here is good. the pizza here is about 15 inches across, width of a medium pizza. i recommend people to get their own pizzas instead of sharing. i got mine here and my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the top and bottom weren't really pieces of pizza, but rather chunks of mozzarella cheese. that's what it was all about. lots of mushrooms. next time i am looking for a good pizza to share with a friend, i will be returning to tryst."

"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and i do admit the flavor is marginally better than caesar's $5 pizza. the only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking wet from being drenched in oil. 

alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals. the pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! it's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs

"parents took me here while i was home for labor day. we walked right in on a saturday evening, no wait. place is nice and open inside, especially on a nice day with the patio open. 

we got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. i was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. i was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in sautéed onions, but wow were they good. seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in. tasted like a chicken

Yummy pizza, salads, and entrees. business was good - pizza was ready on time and on target. lyin' us when we said there was no lycopodium in this pizza. well, there wasn't a lot of lycopodiums in this pizza - we just ordered some.

the garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good. some of the garlic bread was bit tough but still has a good flavor. the wedges are nicely flavored and crispy. was a bit pricey - but sort of worth it if you love meat and want the adventure.

service was very friendly. sort of awkward when we first came in but man, it sure as hell was good when we finished. recommend pouring yourself

Yummy pizza and i mean that in everything they do. good sauce, awesome crust and they make it really fast so do be aware of that. the wings on the other hand are good and if you just want to pick up some wings you will have an easier time doing so than saying hello as everyone knows everyone is friendly. 

rate my pizza bro.  it's been awhile since my first visit when it was good. 

the pizza here is pretty standard shabbos style pizza.  there isn't a lot of seating area indoors so in person it's pretty comfortable.  i would have to say i like the nyc small pizza joint vibe.  people are always friendly, there aren't any drive in's or heavy

alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals. the pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! it's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. their ranch dressing

while you're there, you should definitely get the garlic braid appetizer, which came with some garlicky buns on the side.  you must admit, having some buns on the side really helps fuel up before the big night.  after all, what good is a good pizza without a good buns?!

Yummy pizza and i was a little skeptical when i first saw it on yelp but experienced none of the symptoms typical of those of a spice junkie.  only thing not to like is the lack of brisket or chicken.  what they lack in brisket they more than make up for in quality of pizza, which i will admit is rather impressive.  chicken stock is used sparingly on the pizza so don't be turned off by the lack of meat.  

the good news is that they are regular breakfast people so don't be turned off by the lack of meat.  they also are very understanding of their food; they realize how limited the options are for those who aren't from the area and they strive to serve those

good ny pizza. 
fast. 
good selection of slices with cool toppings. 
easy to stop in if you're walking on fremont. 

bottom line: don't drive across town for this one, but it's a good stop if you're on foot in the area."

Yummy pizza and i love the combination of the tomatoes and the balance of sweet and coffee. it's the type of food you need to fatten up before the great hibernation. if bears could, they would order the duck poutine pizza before they slept for the winter. and after a lunch of this pizza i needed a nap. it's definitely worth a trip to bannock to eat this deliciousness especially if you need to bulk up for a long cold winter."

Yummy pizza! Great service and nice atmosphere.
"When i saw this place show up as a hot new business on the yelp frontpage, i thought it was a bit of a silly name.  but it says on their business card that they are from the moon, so i guess it means business as usual.  we headed over to get a slice of the mint pizza before it became available.  the place was pretty dead even when we walked in, but their pizza is top notch whenever i eat it.  it's fluffy, buttery, almost pastry-like (i believe they use crisco shortening in the dough) so expect more of the same everywhere.  my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to

Yummy pizza at a small price. the staff is very nice.  i would like to try their specialties, but that would be wonderful!  i also would like to try their chicken - but that was bland and repetitive.  it's late night and there's been no activity on the menu.  all i know is the pizza turned out pretty good.  a steady diet of pizza and beer should keep you full for a long time.  

piola is near queen and dufferin, a bit far from the downtown core.  there is plenty of parking and you can bike there if you want."

Yummy pizza and salad. followed by a large pepperoni slice and a 6-inch chocolate chip cookie. my only complaint is that the slice is comparatively large -- it's not the size of a small pizza -- but i would still consider it a slice.

Very fast service pizza and i know what you are thinking….why in the world would you order from a restaurant that you can't see for miles? well, for one thing, there is no place like it in pittsburgh. for another, they have their share of great pizza. omg their spinach dip is to die for not only is it tasty, but it was a generous portion given the number of customers that came in. we ordered a few things that were unusual: a few slices of tomato, and a small child's pizza. to his credit the child did not complain - he just got another slice when the old dude came in. 
     other than that great pizza the place was pretty standard - nothing special, but it was

Very fast service pizza and i had a salad today and i must say that i wasn't disappointed. the garlicky goodness of pizza sauce set aside for another time was simmered over fine ground chicken with minor adjustments to seasonings. not bad. a favorite of ours is to get pizzas halfway through the night and have them here by 7:30 on a lunch date. they usually ship out the next day and today was no different. pizza was nice and thick and had a good flavor. i definitely recommend this place for its excellent pizza and its fast delivery."

Very fast service pizza and i'm a convert. omg their pepperoni pizza is to die for literally. i mean, it's the size of a medium pizza and it just melts in your mouth.  no one in their right mind would call this pizza pizza hard to make.  it just takes awhile to prepare, and then you have the chance to try their many different combinations.  my favorite is the roasted chicken and crispy chicken breast.  they also serve a lot of sweet desserts.  i'm not crazy about this style of pepperoni, but it works for me.  the crispy chicken breast is what sold me.  the rest of the menu looks awesome, but i don't know how many people here actually eat fried chicken.  maybe it

Very fast service pizza and i am a new york so...i cannot say enough good things about piola. i moved into the building late last year and have probably visited the restaurant, or had take out, close to 10 times already! eating in the staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. taking out they are always fast.

must endorse the san danielle pizza - fresh mozzarella with parma ham, mmmm and do not forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. the diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. the crust here is right up there with terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower.

of the delivery pizza places, i like pizza hut the most. their on line ordering feature is extremely intuitive, allowing you to visually customize your exact order. 

this particular location just so happens to be the one assigned to deliver to my location. in the short time i've lived here, i've always had pleasant experiences with the delivery people. they always seem to be happy, and are decently engaged. also, they always seem to arrive early or on-time...which is kind of important.

all in all, the via linda pizza hut is a reliable choice for a decent pizza in my opinion.

Very fast service pizza and sauce is to die for and the staff is very friendly they also like to play lots of card games very much fo5! mostly strategy games but also britney high rollers, cats, and mash. half the time i'm playing night watch while the other half is for my personal use. i like the card games but the stockings game is more of a family affair so they get the occasional visit from the elder part of the family. half the time i'm playing at night and the other half is before dawn or on a nice day with the weather cooper. i'd have to say i like the large family restaurant chain that owns this place very much."

the pizza taste just like pizza in  new york .  it has a thin crust  and they cook it in the brick oven. the sauce is so full of flavor.  it is hard to find good pizza anywhere outside of new york but this is the best i have had so far.. im craving it right know. i usually get the pepperoni or add hot peppers to it..

Very fast service pizza .. delivery within 24 hours. pizza is amazing .. crispy crust and he likes it spicy.  i think the mint oil in his pizza is also awesome. i added a fried egg  to it because i feel it gives it a bit of extra crunch.  he also added crushed up tomatoes .... yum!"

"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the $6 large pizza is a nice deal, especially if you just arrived from out of town. the place felt very welcoming, and the fact that they were so friendly compared to the thousands of people who have tried to get in on this little gem of a place should tell you everything you need to know about this small place. the only reason i would not give it a 5 star rating was that they were out of six of the pizzas i had. 

for my money, this is the best pizza i have ever eaten. the thought of riding my scooter

Very fast service pizza and i had such a good experience! on this visit i asked for a giant slice with extra meaty sauce on top! in my previous reviews i already noted that the pizza is excellent! awesome crust, awesome cheese, and an amazing sauce. also worthy of noting that they are consistent... it's always awesome!

i know it's weird. lol i thought of asking for extra sauce on top because there is a place in brooklyn i used to go to all the time called l & b spumoni gardens. i know extra sauce is a boring for a pizza topping but let me tell you it was delicious!!!!!! mmmmm!! mmmm!! even this photo makes my mouth water!"

placed a to-go order. the pizza was ready by the time i got there and was a great price with the coupon. the pizza is amazing! i can't stop eating it. because of the thickness of the pizza, you can eat two slices and be full. recommend sharing a large with 3 other people or saving it for leftovers. i think it tastes even better the next day after being warmed up in the microwave."

i won't go into all the details but the pizzas are great. thin crust, focus on the quality of the ingredients. fresh and tasty.

quebecois beware. there aren't handfuls of toppings, the quebecois couple we invited with us once were shocked to have been deprived their usual bucket of toppings that dilutes the taste of a well done wood oven cooked pizza.

i came here because they have a vegan pizza that is made with hummus instead of fake cheese! i thought this was so awesome, but you can see from the picture that the hummus is just mainly piled on top in the middle instead of spread uniformly over the pizza as a base. so basically you eat the pizza with veggies on it, and then take a spoon to the center to get the hummus. all of the ingredients tasted good despite the awkward assembly.

"finally made a visit to lucille this past weekend and i can't wait to go back!  i'd heard mixed reviews on the pizza but honestly that's crazy!  that being said everything pales in comparison to their nachos...seriously...they are the best nachos i've ever had!  their drinks are out of this world (which was expected since they're a merchant step-sister) and the lounge in the basement is a must for after dinner socializing (tip: order

Very fast service pizza savagely cuts, leaves very much like pizza in in ny

i am rating this based on how quickly it was all sorted out and the quality of the food. i also want to note that although the menu says it's New York style pizza, it actually nice chilled...maybe a little warm in here? i have never had a pizza here without first showing them how to fold their pizza. 

a steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their pizza and they always had it their way. 

i reluctantly moved to a new location so i can give you guys a honest and unfiltered review.  my first time here with my husband we ordered a few things up top and he had the pizza and

Very fast service pizza and i had a mango mohito with that. the service was great. ordered pizza and same old... same old! in the morning when i walked in a few minutes before 6:30 there was no one there but the owner and his wife were doing their thing. very friendly! glad we decided to walk in today though."
"this is my last stop on the reign of terror of vegan hotspots in downtown las vegas.  it's a pizza shop in the plaza hotel with a vegan slice called the soho.  it's pretty majestic, including spinach, artichoke, and the daiya cheese we all love.  the crust is chewy and delicious.  at other times (like daytime) they offer

Very fast service pizza and salad. very friendly staff. good prices. good food.
"good prices. 
good service. 
fast. 
good selection of slices with cool toppings. 
easy to stop in if you're walking on fremont. 

bottom line: don't drive across town for this one, but it's a good stop if you're on foot in the area."
"the thin crust pizza here is the best i've had in the valley. the thick or deep dish is just okay it doesn't really do it for me to say the least. but boy are the flavors there when you order the thin crust.  we always used to come here on tuesdays to get the tuesday take

"my family and i were so excited to be visiting from out of town!  we arrived at around 5:30 on a saturday and there was plenty of space - the place was filling up when we were leaving though.  i love, love, love that it is very kid friendly while still having amazing grown up food.   they have a kids menu, crayons and a little play area in the corner with some toys and a chalkboard wall.  my girls both had the kids salami pizza and my only complaint would be that

Very fast service pizza when its hot and fresh and super tasty. any salad you place an order on is fully prepared by the woman behind the register, which is why there are so many salad bars and why so many women work in restaurants. men working really nice... i will be back."
"i worked as a waitress in a sushi restaurant for a friend's family for a summer vacation.  it was very busy at all, including the hours we were having a family dinner.  the restaurant was very clean and comfortable, and very relaxing.  the service was great and our waitress was excellent.  the only reason i would not give it a 5 star rating was that the pizza we ordered was late for lunch and forgot to mention they had wi-fi.

Very fast service pizza and i think that is saying a lot"
"i moved to the peoria area about 7 months now and i was trying to find that one really good local pizza joint. peoria style pizza is pretty darn good! this place has a lot going for it. 1. they serve hot and iced coffee; 2. they serve lunch - my wife and i were in town for a work/pleasure trip and  ate there brooding over whether or not to return as i was fairly certain that everyone at work ate there too! ; 3. they serve ice cold iced tea - my wife only drinks it occasionally but it was the only thing not generously given.  4. they serve pizza in small 1 medium pizza - my wife

Very fast service pizza and i am a native gringo.  pizza is solid and the staff is very nice.  i am reccomended to stop by and try their pizza.  my family did and loved the pizza.  

check out their awesome ginger beer slice.  it's awesome. 

if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you.  they have a nice selection of pizza types, hand cut, handmade, crispy crust and they are super tasty.  

the staff is super friendly, really nice and the place is very clean.  there was never a smell of cigarette smoke, but there was a strong smell of alcohol.  i would definitely come back!

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's simple and delicious.

Pizza sauce and i was instantly reminded of my childhood, where we would get pizza from mom and pop's, and dad would always beat the crap out of us. so when my big brother told me about this place, i was intrigued. 

my big bro and i had a pizza at lunch with sausage, mushroom, and eggplant.  it was huge, and kind of crispy.  i also wanted to try out the pizza that evening, so i walked up to the counter and ordered.  the pizza was ready, and hot.  

the next morning, when i went to breakfast, my first thing was to ask for the salad course.  there was no question on my mind - this was a delicious and generous portion

Pizza sauce is my absolute favorite.  although it's pricey, it's the only good thing about this place.  the happy hour is over.  

this is the type of restaurant that is typically found downtown pittsburgh. classic bar, awesome pizza and a large selection of fine scodellina dishes. what more could you possibly want."

Pizza sauce is a perfect compliment!  my only complaint is that the  interior decor is a little warm in here. i.e. wood burning fireplace, bar stools, ping pong tables, cake trim, chocolate chip cookies, tvs...mmm!  i would have to say i like grulla.  dislikes the term limoncello.  it means little brother/sister in cattivo in florida.  i think it is just good ol boys playing tag with their phones at night.  plate is large enough for one person to share and is always ready  when needed.  service is quick and friendly.  waiver not required.  waiver validates address on card and is valid for one year.

Pizza sauce is just a tomato paste, which i love! the mozzarella cheese is just okay it doesn't really hold a candle to the quality of the mozzarella. the only thing i won't give is the wait staff; they are always nice and their is always coffee on tap. 

will definitely be back; its hard to find good pizza!!!"
"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. i really haven't found a pizza i can devote myself to in this area.

Pizza sauce is amazing and the family that runs this place seem very nice.  however, the customers seem to be extremely nice and friendly.  in my past reviews I have mentioned that they are very busy so i was curious if there were no problems with waiting in.  no complaints!  quick walk in and pick up service was very good.  large families/parties need to know to expect to wait a long time for a pickup.  large families/parties need to know to expect to wait a long time for a pickup.  large families/parties need to know to expect to wait a long time for a pickup.  large families/parties need to know to expect to wait a long time for a pickup.  large

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's delicious with the garlic bread and because it's homemade.  each time i have requested a large half cheese and half pepperoni pizza.  my mom always gets there pizza and when she says they don't make them anymore, she just means they aren't made.   they were delicious with the garlic bread and pepperoni.   they have a lot of products, and it was all amazing.  i don't think i've ever had a bad order here.  the store owner is super friendly, and the staff is fantastic.  i will definitely be back when i'm in the area!  if you are ever in the area, you must try the pizza!  you will not be disappointed!"

Pizza sauce, which is great.

for my very first time here i had the base * pizza * and added a generous portion of the sauce that came with the Tasso bowl. 

of course, that was before i realized they dont put a lot of sauce because it takes away from the flavor of the pizza. 

i expect to return here frequently to try different combinations of pies."

Pizza sauce is so good that i am totally delighted by the thought of spending quality time with a friend cooking dinner for us. although most restaurants i have eaten from have a waiting list, it is much easier for us to just stick around and eat dinner here. 
             other than that great pizza, the service here was great. we were very charmed by the waitress' enthusiasm - must have been refreshing to see over 40 years old ladies in here! overall, great place to get together with friends to enjoy some terrific food!"

Pizza sauce is my fave.  if you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  ex-large margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $9.99.  they surpising also serve up a great sangria.  my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them.  i think for the most part the pizza was good.  might be better served with a dash of the sauce.  i also tried the 6pc chicken mix, which was great.  there was a thin layer of sauce over the top.  my only complaint

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's so easy to make a good pizza from scratch.  however, i like a little more garlic flavor, so i'm giving that a try.

i also tried the big apple pizza, which is just me and i think it's a good deal.  the slices are huge and they are really tasty.  the only problem was how long everything took. it already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food.  i also tried the gluten free, but that was also very quick and delicious.

overall, great place to get pizzas or i would definitely recommend this place to a friend.  however, i feel compelled

Pizza sauce makes a good pizza, but it's the kind of sauce that you can make a pizza from.  - calzone -  pizza cheep (awesome name!) - mmmmm and do not forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice.  the, um, sauce really is superb.  if you just want to pick up some food, they will be right over here - there is plenty of it here.  

there are a few booths with a few tables in the corner with some pizzas and a small beer selection. the staff are very friendly - even the young kids love to be fussed over.  

pizza is nice thin crunch

Pizza sauce - very good.
first time i ate there i ordered a pepporoni slice, which in retrospect should have been extra spicy because of course there was a good amount of people there.
after noticing that there was a large standing room only crowd at the top of the stairs when we entered, i guessed it was because there were a few dozen people in there at the time. not the most welcoming sight, but i figured they were just happy to be there and left everything else alone. not to worry though, my sweetie got a table right away and the rest of the table quickly became aware of the situation. 

the pizza was great, thick and crispy crust and the sauce was amazing. the jalapeno is what

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's really tomato based.  add hot peppers to that for even more heat.  my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely.  that was enough for me to know it was there, but not a big deal.  my husband and i both had lots of cheese.  half way through baking my pizza they brought it to a halt and gave us our money back.  in my case, they gave usour money back because i had asked nicely and they felt it was reasonable.  my husband got his pizza and his only complaint was that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped.  i think the guy was more upset by the fact that i didn't

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it was cold-cured and it made me feel like a home-maker.

"good pizza, good price. 
the thick - or deep dish - is very good.  if you just want to pick up some pizza, you will have to pay the $3.50 service fee.  which is kind of ridiculous, because everyone on this ship gets their pizza covered, right?"

Pizza sauce is so good! the family that runs this place also runs local favorite chain alfredo's. we always order pizza from there and it's a very big deal when we come to eat here.  i think the wait staff is super friendly!  i also need to mention that they are super nice when i am with my family.  they are always fast and friendly when we are eating here.  

piola is near campus so of course they use the same campus pizza cutter i do. the only difference between the two is that the pizza is smaller and more like a mini pizza.  i actually like the mini version better.  the family that runs this place seem to be regulars so of course they know how to treat

Pizza sauce is beyond amazing.  you get a large pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and tomato but the real star here is the pizza and the wings it's a perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  i also need to mention how delicious the sweet arts philly soup.  it's not clear to me why people are still coming here but we will definitely be back."
"i absolutely love this place. i moved to the peoria area about 7 months now and i was trying to find that one really good local pizza joint and i finally found it a few months ago! this place has such a unique place, you can have the exact pizza you love and as fresh as possible because it's baked in your own oven. they use fresh ingredients,

Pizza sauce is so tickling!  a few people asked me what kind of pizza i would like and i gave them a 5-ingredient pizza.  they then asked if there was a specific kind of pizza that they would like and i explained what kind of pizza i would like.  the person took a picture of the pizza and sent it to the person next to them who they indicated wanted to take a picture of the pizza they ordered.  the person next to them took a picture of the pizza they ordered and sent it to the person who told them to stop by.  the person taking the picture of the pizza asked me if i wanted to add tomato slices to it because they were very unique to them and i thought it added a lot

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's easy to make a good pizza with little work and it's tasty.

there was a small child sitting on the floor beside the parents. the parents asked the child what he thought of the pizza and he said he loved it.

"my absolutely favorite pizza in the city, great brunch spot - really reasonable and you can always get a table, because it's really big and has indoor and outdoor space.  i think the ice cream is homeade.  a neighbourhood favorite."

Pizza sauce helps to create that iconic burnt orange pepperoni taste.  if you really want to go all out and get the steak, you can always ask for the dry.  which is why i am not really all set on eating the steak myself, but rather sharing it with a friend.  to each their own!

for my very first time eating there i asked for a giant slice with extra crispy crust and an infinite amount of deliciousness.  to my surprise they gave me a drink instead of a slice of the pizza i was given.  to my dismay they didnt refill my glass, but rather gave me one with a little more of the sauce on it.  obviously i liked the pizza.  the wings are good and the chicken
^
Pizza sauce, there's a good chance that pizza you get will make you salivate with anticipation.  if so, you will have consumed too much pizza sauce, which is why you should always wait until the pizza is ready.  you will thank me later.  order pizza and feel free to up the ante with the pepperoni or add chilli flakes for even more flavour.  my friends and i had a mango mohito and an italian paella, and the iced coffee was superb.  the staff were very friendly, and if you have never been here, don't worry - they are very polite too!  highly recommend coming here!"

"peter piper is arizona's family oriented pizza chain. most people know the location is little changed since it opened, but when you order from them you are taken to the store, where they give you a pizza estimate. your pizza is then shipped to you, where it is ready for you to eat. not bad. the pizza here is mainly pizza (with meatballs and sauce), but they

Pizza sauce is not what it's cracked up to be so don't expect our traditional sticky wafers style pizza.  instead, order the thin crust because it's the least expensive and it gives you more time to prepare a great tasting pizza.

the pizza here is pretty standard, nothing special but decent. i am not a pizza expert so i cannot speak to much more than that. the pizza here is shared with the dinning room service so please be courteous.

dining room service is always nice and their pizza is awesome! the wings are good too! and so many other things! great place to get a quick bite while shopping!"

Pizza sauce gets a thumbs up from me. thumbs up! paprika is not a harsh pepper by any means, but it is not a New England favorite either.  if you like traditional, then great! if you are a first-timer, then so be it.  my recommendation is to get a few inches of pizza in there before committing to a whole."

Pizza sauce just doesn't cut it. . . it's also quite pricey . . . although it's written all over the place that this place is 100% free, it's quite easy to score a table by asking. $7.50 is a fortune in this part of town, so don't be turned off by the signage. 

. . . and they don't just stop there. they offer a variety of tasty subs, pastas, and sandwiches. 

. . . my only complaint is that they don't bring the pizza out until it's ready."

Pizza sauce is not to faint with this pizza. we were able to finish it off with a glass of wine.  add in the fact that we were admitted as guests, and you have a great example of a no frills, high roll up bar pizza.  my husband and i both had the fortune to have had the pizza hand crafted for us.  we also enjoyed the many drinks we had.  my husband had the beer bill, and added 5 cents to the wine amount.  a very generous tip.  your experience will be different if you are a first time guest, but i highly recommend coming here as it was very hands on for just us and was very friendly with the other diners.  we will definitely be back."

^
Pizza sauce is so good.  the family that runs this place also runs a number of places in the area, so I always check to see if they closed down. Sometimes they come out right away, sometimes not.  we always used to come here on tuesdays to get the tuesday take out special which apparently stopped. when we called today to go get the usual tuesday deal to us the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no. so now that they have taken away my tuesday special i can tell you at this moment that the chances of us going to nellos after this are slim
^
Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's rich and it gives pizza a homemade feeling. i also love the mediterranean pizza, which has eggplant in it. have fun! :)

quebecois beware. there aren't handfuls of toppings, the quebecois couple we invited with us once were shocked to have been deprived their usual bucket of toppings that dilutes the taste of a well done wood oven cooked pizza.

the arancini balls are very very good.

their nutella pizza is a favorite of ours too.

service is quick and friendly.

my highlights are when the owner passes by and says hello and i get to converse some of my rusty napoletan. :)

Pizza sauce was good, the wings good, and the ambiance was very pleasant. i would definitely come back!"

Pizza sauce is really good.

The ratio of customers to people on this place is insane. 

i actually went here before dinner when i was in town for a work/pleasure trip.  they have really good pizza.  that is also the reason i was so taken with the pizza.  they have really good thin crust pizza.  to save money, they only have charcoal grills.  which is cool.  

i sat on the right side of the pizza and when it came, my left thumb thought it was weird that i couldn't move my thumb.  it wasn't until i looked up menu items that i realized my thumb was completely ignored.  charcoal grills are awesome!  they come with

Pizza sauce is awesome! i also added some hot peppers to half of my pizza. i don't know why but i love this hot pepper mix. it is also really good!

overall, great place to get together with friends to enjoy some terrific food! what i appreciated about it the most is that they are very organized - there was clearly a good structure to everything! they also are very fast when it comes to delivery - they say they are working on it! my only complaint is that the box of toiletries i received was very long and unwieldy - i needed to unwrap it to consume it!

i will be back; it was very good!

overall, great place to get together with friends to enjoy

Pizza sauce is to die for and so is their service! not to mention they were super tasty!

piola is near campus so they have dominoes which is avexilon - pizza for children. and the wings are good!

what i liked about them the most is that they are not pushy or take their business too seriously. they take it very seriously and seem very happy taking it order alone. also, the staff is great! they are very friendly and good service is always appreciated.

what i will not recommend is to try their dinner menu as it is extremely limited - if you are over 21 you must be 21 or over 6 months to order from them.

Pizza sauce is my fave and i'm a huge fan of the hot cookies as well. i always get a free large with a purchase of $5 or $6 at the register. 

i've been here twice back to back. first time i got a free large with a purchase of $5 and was happy with the service; they were very kind to me. secondly time i tried to 'layer' the flavors by asking them to make rings of sauce on the crust before cheese and toppings are added. the result wasnt as i was expecting and i realized they dont put a lot of sauce because it makes the pie soggy.

i expect to be coming here frequently to try out the different combinations of pies."

Pizza sauce is to die for and so is their service! very friendly waiters and great food and will ever be my go to spot.

peter and his wife, mrs. piper, opened the pizza hut in high noon, still standing today. they also operate the high five, the wedgie, the 3 month, the three dollar, the four dollar, the six dollar, the eight dollar, the zen garden, three

Pizza sauce is so good.

in the past we have ordered from this place and our wait times have been very fast. 

i know it's weird. 

i have eaten here on multiple visits when i was younger and have never been let down. 

this is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family.  i would definitely recommend!"
great restaurant! great service and great pizzas! consistently good service and excellent food. bartenders who are very nice! great beers on tap! customer service is excellent.

Pizza sauce is wonderful and the family that runs this place seem very nice.  however, the pizza is the real star.  a rare gem in this city!!

this is the best pizza i have ever eaten !!!!  there is no other pizza i eat !!!!  there is a reason that every other family member, friend, and i has to try this pizza time and time again.  no matter the size of pizza we are talking about this is the best pizza i have ever eaten !!!!

i think the best part is the constant stream of people coming in to pick up their pizzas.  we have stopped in here on a whim to eat and they seem to be coming back more than happy to see us.  if

Pizza sauce and italian food.  it was very very good and had a nice flavor.  i also had the antipasti minto, meatballs and pizza battle.  the meatballs were not bad and did i mentioned the mushrooms.  they are not normally a part of pizza but they were delicious.  the only thing not to like it was how long everything took.  i assumed the pizza is maxed out so we just ate the whole thing.  service was great and the atmosphere is great.  everything was great except for one thing which i forgot to mention.  that is why i am not giving them 5 stars.  there was a side order that i was not presented.  in the future when i am in the

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's easy to make a good pizza from scratch and the store carries it.  i also love the walnut pizza because of the amount of walnuts used.  5 whole pizza leaves us with a nice topper.  

there really isn't a place in town that i would rather be.  

every one needs to go here! it's a good family place so please, don't forget to bring your friends! we will happily engage in any activity that brings in some new customers! welcome to the family!."

Pizza sauce is my personal favorite.  there are a few pizza places in town that i have yet to find which i love more than to this!  
     other than that great pizza there was not a dull moment.  quick bite with a 10 second cook time.  sizzling hot and crust done right away.  10 min wait time - food is here!  great staff; friendly customers; point blank out the back door.  pack a lunch, you will need it."

Pizza sauce is so soo good. i am not a huge fan of the blackened pizza but love the oregano's pizza. it is very good and has a coffee flavor. the ratio of the ingredients is so on point.  i order here at least once a month for lunch with my co-workers. they always have killer deals such as 2 medium speciality pizza for $16.99 - their specialy pizzas are amazing as they have around 5-6 toppings on it. southwest chicken and meat combo are my fave.  if you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  ex-large margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $

"had lunch with my wife here.  she's colombian and felt it had some traditional colombian flavors with more modern simple dishes.  i mention the colombian part as there are really no restaurants close by with rice, beans, sweet plantains, empanadas, and steak.  was very good quick and attentive service.

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's really tasty combined with the fact that it's vegan.  i also love the hoagies because they're vegan and really hard to beat.  the only thing not to like this pizza is that it's large. i assume that's why it's taking so long to cook."

Pizza sauce was amazing. i also ordered a bunch of bread with extra crispy chopped parsley and they were great!

     other than that great pizza and hot peppers, there wasn't a bad choice here.  either of them were great.  i would definitely eat here again on my next visit to toronto!"

Pizza sauce is soo good!  i wish i had taken a picture so you could see the tan line down the middle of the pizza, which is what drew you here.  my only complaint is that the bar across the hall was a little low.  i would have liked to have seen a larger menu, more drinks, or else we would have been happy to wait for your call."

Pizza sauce is my favorite because it makes a pizza taste better than the real deal.  however, i have to admit that my high school sweetheart got the real deal when she visited!  was a pleasant surprise.  my only complaint is that the glass of wine is small. i don't know what their pour is but it is the only thing not generously given. not served in a traditional stemmed glass, it was more like a small 1/2 full glass of fruit juice. but i went for the pizza, not the wine. also, short wait time. the pizza bakes in 90 seconds once it is in the oven. novanta means 90."

Pizza sauce is so good.  think of it like a classical pizza with meatballs and sausages.  an amazing dish when you first try it.  you will probably want to try the pizza despite the small size.  the meatballs are very good and crispy.   other than that the pizza is very good.  i am not a huge fan of the large garlic bread and it gets the job done, but the meatballs are great and come with a generous amount of sauce.

Pizza sauce is so good i am totally thrilled we found it here! pizza is nice and big for like 4 bucks and it was an awesome pizza. the wings are good and say what?! i don't know what they are but they are the best piece of wings i've ever had! they are also the only thing not generously given.  like where did the other guests get their wings? we asked and they said they came from another state so i don't know what their favorite is but the one on the pittsburgh sideline was obviously tipsy on the best part and they all shared!  my wife and i both had the pizza special (ratatouilli sp?) and although it wasn't as i was expecting, it was still delicious.
^
Pizza sauce is my favorite because it's so comforting.  there's a reason that 80% of the products sold in the restaurant are returned because they're dirty.  which is why i'm not mad at you if you ask me.  you can buy my pizza by the slice at the stand right next to the restaurant.  if you want to try my specialty pizzas, you will have to order from the restaurant.

the only reason i would not give it a 5 star rating was that i was expecting something special, and that i realized they only serve

Pizza sauce...mmmm!  the husband and i both had the pizza special (i gave him a pinkissimo when he asked for the recipe) and he said that he enjoyed it very much.  there was also some talking going on outside of the restaurant which i won't go into all detail about.  the pizza was also quite good.  the ratio of the ingredients was very good for a bar food place.  i will say that the staff is very nice.  they are very friendly their pizza is amazing and their pizza is top notch whenever i take a bite i feel very welcome.  i will definitely be back"

Pizza sauce is a generous portion with a rich flavor that is not too sweet.  the dark chocolate adds a nice spark of interest.  

the blackened chicken and beef is not the best pizza ever.  i prefer the thin crust to the rich because it crisens up the pizza and you can see the meat through the crust.  the ratio of the ingredients is up to you.  i prefer the thin crust because i feel it makes me smarter.  the rich sauce makes me hungry quicker.  

the garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good.  i also need to mention how delicious the garlic bread and the wedges were - even when leftovers are taken home!  my only

Pizza sauce also made my pizza. very tasty indeed.

service was great - attentive, polite and friendly.

choice of toppings delicious - I went with the mushroom pizza and man were the results awesome!

by the look of the menu it looked like there was some great pizza being made - must have been because i was immediately struck by how busy and compacted everyone was being. 
      so we got right to it. we ordered pizza and mushrooms. it was off to a great start! we sat back, enjoyed the beautiful surroundings and quickly realized how busy and compacted everyone was being.  we needed to order ahead so we could switch seats.  unfortunately, we couldn't do that.  we

Pizza sauce is amazing and the whole family loved it! i also tried the big apple pizza, garlic chicken pizza, and the anaconda shrimp pizza. the simplicity of the ingredients and how they were combined was very appealing. i must admit that when i first looked up 'the pizza hut' i didn't even realize that there were only two locations!?!?!! ah well, at least for the moment i'm keeping an eye on delivery!!!"

Pizza sauce is my fave.  there is a small child sitting next to the little one who needs to be nipped and tucked in before he cries himself.  my wife and i are real pizza eaters and love the mild restaurant style pizza.  the parents are weekend warriors and drive 2 hours to get there for dinner.  i think the large size just makes it easier on the stomach.  we always order pizza with chicken.  if you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  ex-large margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $9.99.  there is plenty of toppings to choose  from.

Pizza sauce is not to faint, its thick and to the point.  if you dont like the thick, use water instead.  if you like thin greasy pizza, then jack it up a notch!  if you are a first-timer, then ask for a side of sauce.  if you like your pizza hot, then don't be turned off by the hefty amount of sauce that is required.  if you like your pizza cold, then you deserve it.  my dad never complained about his pizza, he just knew it was good.  my mom always delivers, she too is a first-timer, never had a bad experience .  for those of you who are wondering no, i am not th owner but i am one of

Pizza sauce is my favorite.  there's a reason that everywhere i go people ask me what kind of pizza they should get and i usually give them a thumbs up or down.  people need to realize that wherever i go there is usually more people in the store eating pizza than they are playing video games.  if you get a burger it's usually hot and needs to be greased up first before it can be eaten.  if you get a pizza it's usually pretty good and you can always ask.  my wife and i both got here before lunch when they heard the wait was 45 minutes but realized it was probably even longer than that because of the buzz that surrounded the place.  if you are looking for a quick bite while shopping, look

i was there early for work and got a slice of the pizza i was going to get ready for dinner. it was huge but it was thin crust and it was all i was having and i was hungry so i ate the whole pizza crudo style. not bad. the slices are large and there are only about 10 of them so you can try many different kinds.

i also tried the big apple pizza, which is just spicy pepperoni. 

overall, great place to get pizza. good service and nice atmosphere

Pizza sauce is also amazing, i think this makes up for the poor taste of the pizza.  people must be crazy to think this has only been around for 3 years, but it has already made a big mark on our pizza.  mustard on the cob, that is.  

i am not a real pizza lover, i have never visited a strip mall and i have to say i like the nyc small pizza joint aspect. the place doesn't look the best, the walls are on the low quality end, the counter tops are really low quality, and the pizza is very thin crust.  which is why its so hard to please a girl, and why i am not going to attempt to please her.  there is plenty

Pizza sauce is my absolute favorite.  there's a reason that every other menu item on this website is over $10 and i have yet to see a $9.99 menu item.  regardless, i must say that i am extremely pleased that they have fixed the delivery glitch so quickly.  although it may look like they are offering free wifi on certain site visits, in fact they are offering a 15% discount on a $7 order.  i cannot complain as this has been a very generous offer.

Pizza sauce is full of flavorful ingredients that will have you coming back for more!  i would definitely recommend this place to anyone! when i say people, i really mean it. all the customers i have talked to are very polite and friendly towards each other.  i would really recommend this place to anyone! i mean, everyone should have tried it, but i don't want to commit to a specific date.  my guess is that it's been closed for awhile, but i haven't had a bad experience on the phone or in person.  the place just needs time to catch up on their pizza! when they are open, they will be a regular for my wife and i."

Pizza sauce is not to heavy for pittsburgh style pizza. about 5-6x the price of normal-old-fashioned-paella. i think pizza hut harvests some of these great ingredients while camping in hawaii.  so yes, yes, yes!!! i am returning to trystsburgh's famed pizza.  i am returning because it is so good!!!

pizza chez danny makes tasty pizza that will squash your late night craving. the crust is thin and crisp on the bottom, but soft on top. the addition of sesame seeds on the top adds a delicious nuttiness to every bite of the sweet crust. the mixed cheese of the simple cheese pizza melts into yummy goodness and sits on a light

Pizza sauce - absolutely amazing!  location is not much to look at on the outside, but very clean and fresh on the inside.  plenty of parking."
"ordered pizza and 8pc chicken combo.  it was very good pizza and the price was very good.  delivery was in 45 minutes and it was all good.  i will be back when i am in the area.  

45 minutes later i received a call from the restaurant to inform me they no longer served chicken and i was left with a 6pc chicken mix.  there was no discussion of the 6pc or the 2 pc pizza.  the call alone was a very good decision on their end.  there was no arguing with the cook, we just ordered

Pizza sauce is so good when i need to wash down some craft beer with a tall can of soda.

overall, it is hard to find good pizza but i have to say they worked great here. i ordered a pizza with chicken and it was great.

will be back when i am in the area.

do you guys serve ginger beer? i thought it was complete garbage and i still think it is fantastic.

overall, great place to get pizzas. 

do you guys serve garlic knots?  i am not a huge fan of the spicy kind but they were great and the garlic bread was fantastic! 

do you guys serve pepperoni?  i am not a huge fan of the

Pizza sauce is my absolute favorite!  there is a nice garden feel to the restaurant.  the pizza is very tasty.  portions are large, so don't forget to ask for a giant slice!  i do wish that they served up some type of homemade sourdough starter, but that's for another day.  my kids love their pizza, it's part of their weekly rotation, and they seem to like it even when it's late at night.  my husband and i both love their pizza, it's helpful when we're at work when we don't want to commit to a specific place and are too much of a bum to go back.  

till next time, ask for the giant slice!"

Pizza sauce, mmmm and do not forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. the diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. the crust here is right up there with terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower.

would also endorse the spaghetti and meatballs, so so tender the meatballs fall apart with a fork and the pasta is perfectly cooked with fresh curls of parmesan all over the top. 

look for the great daily specials - wednesdays is half price bottles of wine! so awesome. i believe kids eat free on sundays too."
