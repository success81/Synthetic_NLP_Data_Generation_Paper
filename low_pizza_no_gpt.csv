0,1,Negative,"i ordered a pizza at 4:49. got an email that said my pizza would be delivered at 5:18 to5:28. 5:38 still no pizza. called the store. they said it was out for delivery. i said i knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. still no pizza. called the store back. again, i was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. when i was on the phone the pizza came. when it arrived it was cold."
1,2,Negative,"the pizza wasn't very warm when it arrived (they didn't use the warming bag at time of delivery) and the order was wrong, but the pizza tasted good."
2,2,Negative,"food was great! loved the pepperoni rolls and the zamboni fries! service was sub par. they hustled at first; however the server entirely forgot our pizza. when we inquired, she proceeded to blame it on the kitchen. she never apologized, nor did she offer a discount. she coerced us into paying our tab and did not offer to get us any additional food or beverage. furthermore, she did not pass on to another server that we intended to stay and eat and drink-even though we explicitly stated that. we stayed for 45 minutes waiting to order more food and have our drinks refilled. our plates were cleared and we were not offered additional food/drink. no one addressed us. l

overall: good food, bad service."
3,1,Negative,if i could i could give 0 stars i would. so we show up around 5:30pm on a monday. place is pretty empty. ordered drink which took about 30 mins to get. ice was already melted in my drink. ordered apps and meals. we did not get out food until 7:30. we waited a hour and a half for food @ a empty upscale pizza shop. btw my pizza was cold. and there is some manager guy walking around looking busy but what a joke. also i ordered a calzone which was not a calzone. crust chandler simply italian is a joke of a place and anyone that waste there money obviously does not care about the food they put in there mouth or any kind of service. what a rip off. just remember every time someone has a bad experience they tell 10 people. i was with 4 people. that's 50 people in day. i think the major issue is the customer base has no clue what good italian is. it sad that so many people accept this.
4,2,Negative,"the pizza was great, but the guys that make it , while we were there they were scratching their heads, taking  their hats off to run fingers through their hair. and one guy that was cutting up something was eating. they need to wash their hands after scratching. will not be back to this one"
5,2,Negative,"if giordano's is looking to compete with lou malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe. the crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza. lou malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries. c'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!

to someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite. 

overall giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either. they could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks.
 
if you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to grimaldi's."
6,1,Negative,"fix your store, it is so poorly run that i cannot even go there. there are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!

our neighborhood is not this gross but if i was from outside the area, i would think it's the slums. totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. no excuses.

it also has a foul odor to it...the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks...nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards"
7,2,Negative,"went for the 1st.time to cpk on the advice of a friend, there were 8 in our party. we were seated at a table that was made for 6, kinda cramped for space,we endured because they said the wait for a bigger table would be 20 min. although there were 2 areas  bigger than where we sat that were empty.  
         now when your waitress finally shows for drinks (about 5 min) and the first words out of her mouth are.  ""they must think i'm  wonder woman, i already have a table of 7 and a table of 12"". translated= hey guys, your service is gonna suck but that's not my fault. and it did!!!!
          my wife and i split the pepperoni, sasuage and mushroom pizza, obviously  'shrooms are the cheapest ingredient cause that's about all we could find. pizza was bland, 'shrooms  overpowering and service sacked. if that's what your looking for in a dining experience, then this is the restaurant and location for you. if not  stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
8,2,Negative,"horrible customer service. i have gotten food from here a few times expecting to have a better experience from the last, but i was wrong to hope for that. i once called and they answered ""hold on"" and just put the phone down. after waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. i called back again and they answered ""hold on"" again. i waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. i asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says ""well what do you want to know specials on?"" in a kind of sarcastic tone. we've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. this has happened multiple times. when going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. horrible customer service. the food here is way over priced. the pizza is mediocre. they may use ""fresh ingredients"" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. maybe i would have thought the food was better if i received better service. 

if you want wayyyy better ny pizza go to rockos pizza. way better prices, extremely friendly service, way better everything."
9,1,Negative,"this hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest.  the pepperoni is clustered around the center.  the sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it.  the crazy bread is tasty though."
10,2,Negative,"more like 2.5 stars. i'm giving two so the owners will have more incentive to make the necessary tweaks.

i really wanted to like strada 241. it's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food was lackluster. we split a salumi plate and each had a pizza (i had the 'nduja). the salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats. the pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven).

i would come back to try the pastas and also to see if the pizza improves. there's no lack of effort here and the food is honest."
11,1,Negative,"used to be a good place. has gone downhill the last few years. i already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but i was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . 

i ordered to go and when i got their at 8 pm on a saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, i had a feeling something wasn't right. 
spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. one the was spaghetti with meat sauce, i would compare it to a can of chef boyardee. the other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. 

threw them both in the trash

after this meal, i also threw my streets of new york takeout menu in the trash"
12,1,Negative,one of the worst pizzas i've ever had. the cooks are really cheap when it comes to cheese (the pizza was almost all tomato sauce) because the cheese was missing. absolutely no taste. i don't usually bad reviews unless earned and these ppl working here certainly earned a bad review. maybe the owner is a cheap person and is forcing cooks to be cheap with toppings.
13,1,Negative,"my review is based on my experience with the management, not the food. the food is just ok, nothing to write home about. secret pizza at cosmo is better.

the manager on duty failed to do his duties when i requested him to call security to come assist me when i was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. i felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager never called them. he in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. i spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call. 

shame on you manager on duty sunday 1:30am for lying about calling security."
14,2,Negative,"honestly? it tasted weird. i was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. the sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what i expected. now, mineo's...better pizza."
15,1,Negative,"california pizza kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. the menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. 

before i went vegetarian i used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. i love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. they were addicting. since i've become vegetarian i settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. for some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. not for cpk. 

recently, since beginning to use yelp, i have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that i am used to. however, i tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... ya i just invented a new word. a food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. my friends are this way. it never fails. any time one of them has a birthday i get an invitation to eat at cpk and every time i groan. even before i swore off cpk forever, i was getting extremely tired of it. the second to the last time i went was for my birthday with some friends. i ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. i used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. not good. i struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and i didn't want to waste their money. but it was gross, and i vowed never to order it again. the soup was good though. the last time i went was with my sister, husband and niece. this time i ordered the new caramelized peach salad. on the menu, most of the new items sound really good. its just the execution of them that fails cpk. the peach salad was gross. the peaches were canned and then warmed, and i also saw no caramelization whatsoever. the combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. i didn't even get through half of the salad before i said forget it. my husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. the portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. my sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. she barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! they skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. 

the pricing at cpk has also become outrageous. it was almost $13 for my salad. for a salad! does anyone else find that wrong? considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. for such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. the service also sucks. our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. no refilled waters, no how is everything. she was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. 

so we all have made a vow never to return to any cpk. especially the one in the chandler fashion center. before i went vegetarian, i got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. that was a great experience."
16,1,Negative,first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned
17,2,Negative,second time in and again i wait for a ready now plain ole cheese pizza!   i need to learn to go to another store that may be ready to care for customers!
18,1,Negative,"ordered delivery for me and the kids. two hours later, our meal arrived. i called to inquire after about an hour. was told that the delivery was on the way. minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. do you think it was on the house? nope. just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. not good enough. 
now, let's talk food. the meatball ""panini"" was a piece of french bread with a bland/acidic sauce. the meatballs were overcooked and dry. not a pleasant experience. the pizza sauce was also watery and bland. you'd think that a place called ""sauce"" would have figured it out by now. not so."
19,1,Negative,"if i could give this 0 stars i would.
delivery took an hour. pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping.  gross is the only word i can think of to describe this pizza. save your money. you'll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at giant eagle."
20,2,Negative,"my order got here earlier than expected but the toppings, cheese and sauce is all over the box. now the crust is soggy. i hate being that person but now i have to call for a new pizza."
21,1,Negative,"the service is slow and not very friendly and the pizza tastes store bought. i've tried to eat here several times with friends. 
but it just doesn't seem to do anything for me. 
there's a jack in the box across the parking lot with hot food and friendly service."
22,1,Negative,"this place sucks! the guy was very nice on the phone taking my order, but then 30 min later, i receive some call from gary saying that they do not deliver to me. thanks for letting me know when i placed my order and gave you my cc# already!!
i don't know how the pizza is yet, from other location, because it has yet to arrive. 
waste of time"
23,1,Negative,"horrible food don't waste your money

this is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza i've ever had, i haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. idk where that place is cuz the one i wan in today in east liberty by the home depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.

loudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. not one person there had decent customer service skills i had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and i have excellent hearing. i ordered a small pizza i got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. 

i looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today."
24,2,Negative,"ok for $5 - 6  but not good pizza, no  flavor,  good for young children or anyone else who likes bland pizza!  if they want to charge extra for thin crust they should put it in writing! i would rather give my $5.00 to little cesar's!"
25,2,Negative,"i used to like the pizza from here. last time i ordered it was still doughy and i had to cook longer. today it was ice cold. not even lukewarm. my kid was screaming for pizza so i didn't send it back. but, i won't ever order from here again. $31 plus tip for a cold pizza and cold soup. there was a piece of ""garlic bred"". it was half a sub roll uncooked with some garlic butter on it. yum. should have had a can of progresso and a frozen pizza and saved $25. wait, i could have saved $35. i tipped $10. i figure a poor kid driving his own car deserves a decent tip. i called to let them know and she said sorry we can replace the pizza. my kid ate the cold thing anyway. and who wants to wait another hour for the replacement? blah. next time i'll drive my lazy self over to bonnanos and pick up a pizza myself."
26,2,Negative,"i really enjoy the food, can't say the same about their service. i waited an hour and 20 minutes for two pizzas and when they finally arrived they were incredibly cold! not a happy customer."
27,1,Negative,absolutely avoid this place it's a last resort for me and even then i regret it. undercooked pizza sparse toppings and the rudest employee ever. they need to just shut this place down i've given them so many second chances and will never do it again. when you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! i hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot.
28,2,Negative,"waiter was over the top cheesy.  talked too much.  a bit obnoxious.
no gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (ferro's on st. clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free).
one of the specials had risotto as a side so i asked if i could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no.  treated me like i was asking them to make risotto from scratch.
so i ordered a steak instead which was good but if i wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place.
marcello's is clearly stuck in the past....no variety for those with dietary restrictions."
29,1,Negative,"my wife and i visited east west pizza because we purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate for $2 and we've been questing to find decent pizza in the area.

our meal here was mediocre. we were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while i stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza.

i wasn't going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago i received a spam email from east west -- i must have filled out some comment card or something so, i emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list. they replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. 

for the next several months, despite this guarantee, i continued to receive spam in my email from east west. i emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. tonight i emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming.

east west pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that i never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers."
30,1,Negative,"my fiance ordered from here recently. after waiting almost 2 hours for our pizza to arrive, we called and asked what was going on, they said it would be there soon. ten to fifteen minutes later it shows up and the driver informed us that they forgot to make the pizza. any to top it all off we received some cardboard with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices on it. wouldn't recommend"
31,2,Negative,"i'm just in the area for the day... showing some houses to some buyer clients and needed a place to stop for lunch between appointments. i ate too much. this brother's is not as good as a similar place on peoria... but it was decent. i would eat here again if driving by and in the mood for pizza. my pepsi tasted fine. the girl who took my order was happy & pleasant. i got my soda topped off before i left and i got two sides of ranch at no charge... the only thing i was out off by was that i'm glad i didn't have to pay for the ranch because they were both half full which is why i needed two. if i had paid for them, i would have said something. i'm full, happy and ready for a nap... oh! need to show houses... 

i ordered the two slices of cheese and a pepsi and my total was $4.38

um i went to the bathroom before leaving,.. the door didn't lock and toilet sprayed water (yes toilet water) at me and did not flush properly... hopefully they get that fixed!"
32,2,Negative,"2 stars

the pizza is ridiculously overpriced, $17 for an 11-inch pizza?

our server was a little aggressive, he even complained about his other customers to us.  who knew what he was saying about us?   he also must have thought we were stupid because he kept explaining the difference between sausage  and pepperoni?  really?

the server really ruined this meal for us, he even tried some adult humor with the serving of the beer.  i'll leave it at that.  so the food never had a chance, we just wanted to leave.

if you eat here...take your time, the pizza comes out real fast.

being from new jersey, we know and appreciate good pizza...this was mediocre at best.

we won't be returning."
33,1,Negative,i called in for delivery and waited an hour for them to deliver my pizza which yes they might have been busy i understand but when they drop it off i didn't take a look at the pizza because i was working and put it in the back in the break room as soon as i went to go get a slice the entire pizza was burned and it looked old. i waited an hour at least you guys should have made sure my pizza was not burn and at least somewhat fresh. it's so mess up. they wouldn't even give my money back.
34,1,Negative,i do not recommend going to this location what so ever. please drive a little out of your way and avoid this location. absolutely nothing hot n ready. while waiting 20 minutes for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest one would think the pizzas would be hot but they were room temp with no pizza sauce and hardly any cheese. please do not waste your money and time here. i grew up with little caesars and have been to many in different states over the past 15 years and i have never had such a bad experience food wise i have never left a little caesars pizza and thought i was ripped off but this location had me felling like i was ripped off which i was and you will be too. please go to any other location do not waste your time or money at this location.
35,2,Negative,"this place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  pizza nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one i've ever frequented.  the pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  you dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.  the lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.  it's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.  we didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.  if there was a better option in the area i wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't."
36,1,Negative,really bad experience here. went in at 6pm for a drink and asked about dueling pianos. they start @ 8pm. ok. we had two drinks and were hungry. asked if we could get pizza from across the way and bring in. yes that was fine. get your hand stamped so u can come back in. we got pizza (worst ever) and were then told we could not bring it in. had to sit outside and they were closing the bar for half an hour while they set up. ate and then got in line to go back in. no charge since we had our hand stamped. tried to fit at a table and were told no we had to stand. the tables were reserved!  nowhere did it state that we needed a reservation nor did the bartender tell us that. total bullshit way to treat customers who spent $50 on two drinks each!  extremely disappointed. sucks
37,1,Negative,"ordered from caliente on a weeknight, and it took an hour and a half to get the pizza.  when we finally got the pizza it was cold.  i was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed.  the toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  

bottom line - if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in two hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else."
38,1,Negative,"this is one of the worst experiences i've had at a restaurants. we ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. after over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. he said he was too busy to help us. he said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. if we didn't want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. who treats customers like that? i told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. she just shrugged her shoulders and said ""do what you have to"". i don't think i gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. the management is an embarrassment and service, all around was horrendous. what a disappointment."
39,2,Negative,this place had us pretty impatient the whole time! i shared a pizza with my significant other and he asked for half of it to have no onions but it came out covered in onions all over! it then took a half an hour to split the bill. to be honest i wasn't very impressed by the food.
40,2,Negative,"called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  once i placed my order i was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50....it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?  why a twenty minute range for pickup?  i cancelled order so never got to taste the food.  good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon.

fyi - your rating on yelp is the same as peter piper pizza.  hilarious!"
41,2,Negative,"i don't know what people are talking about. being from nj i can tell you this is not good ny style pizza. it's the kind of pizza you get in ny and then never return to that place again. i tried the regular and the white pizza. the white pie had no flavor, no garlic no salt, nothing. the regular pie had hardly any sauce, and the crust was hard as a rock. i hope there are better places for ""ny style"" pizza in the area.  we left hungry. they also messed up our order so it took about twenty minutes to get four slices of pizza warmed up.

also they weren't wearing gloves or anything. maybe i'm a stickler but i don't like people touching my food with their hands and then touching everything else in the kitchen. gross."
42,1,Negative,haven't been to pizza hut in a few yrs. my daughter and i wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so i ordered online  (ok that wasn't successful so i had to call) anyway i placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust. this was at noon. wasn't very happy. needless to say i don't think i'll be attempting this again any time soon
43,1,Negative,"i wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues...

we were very excited to move into sun prairie where there was a glass nickel pizza nearby (we previously lived in the milwaukee area).  the day after we moved in, we decided to order glass nickel to eat while unpacking.  the staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  pizza itself was okay, but not nearly as good as the new berlin and west madison locations.

the next day, we became violently ill.  with the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing i ate all day so i'm sure that it was from this.  my husband and i are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  we do not plan on re-visiting the sun prairie glass nickel pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  such a shame!!"
44,1,Negative,"still yucky.  picked up an order which should have been hot, hard as a rock like cardboard and burnt on the bottom.  there are many other places in town for good pizza avoid this and you will be more than happy.  hit and miss place, mostly miss"
45,1,Negative,pizza came out cold. we ordered the classic pepperoni and there were probably three slices of pepperoni in the entire pizza. it was just all sauce and cheese.
46,1,Negative,"did the online order. arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after i'm told it will be a little longer, i'm told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  wtf?!?  so now i'm sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  i wouldn't have ordered if i knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings. nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you've already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question i have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when i get home. i want a nice fresh, hot pizza. not something that's been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!!"
47,1,Negative,"the best thing about our visit was our waitress. she was attentive and apologetic that the pizza was terrible. it was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. too bad. it was the first time we have been out in the evening in 4 months.what a disappointment!  we won't be returning."
48,1,Negative,"we ""used"" to order the family special every week or two on a regular basis. food was decent & value for the $ (at that time) was fairly good too. one night we ordered, the food was delivered. we paid cash & tipped well (always do, as i used to deliver fast food myself). we get a telephone call the next day saying that we shorted the driver $10. wtf? seriously? like the driver would not know this right at the door (if it were true)? we do not get a call that night (we ordered for dinnertime) but the next day! clearly they got ripped off by their driver. we have not ever ordered from there again. brampton's best pizza(s)..mackay & gusto's."
49,1,Negative,"i was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  i should have saved my money. person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.

bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. we could tell when we opened the box.  the crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  on one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. the other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  

whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  i would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  that hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.

it such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  do i call and complain? do i have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 pm? 

we also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  good meat and tangy sauce.

finally, i was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  i ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.

i really wanted to like this place, especially because i like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. we won't be going back."
50,1,Negative,"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get the deep dish, i didn't realize that is what they were famous for. also the staff were nice, not overly helpful but never rude. my daughter got their wings, super fatty (probably tyson). there was a long blonde hair in it, she has dark brown hair. when we told our waiter he said ok then took the plate, no apology. they did bring her out new ones but like i said before they were to fatty to enjoy. they did not even offer to take them off our bill. our thin crust pizza taste like it literally came from a box. i can't even remember the last time i have had thin pizza this bad!! the ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and i believe it was covered in the store bought hershey's syrup. i have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. nothing has ever been that disappointing that i felt the need to write one until now."
51,1,Negative,"these people are below average intelligence 
try to rip you off 
argue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store!
had enough of them i do not have the time to teach basic common sense !
the special reads add any pizza for 9.95
(equal or lesser value )
i order a pepperoni and sausage and a specialty pizza.
simple right well they say they can't honor the ""2nd"" pizza because it's a ""specialty""
what does it matter what order i say my pizza's in?
is it the darn important that you have to say the specialty pizza 1st? common sense would be to just charge for the specialty pizza the charge me for the pepperoni and sausage at 9.95 right?
well if i have to teach them basic common sense and argue over it i will just find me a new shop!"
52,1,Negative,"very mediocre pizza. if you're stranded in the brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you're really hungry, you'd be better off walking to the circle k and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives. to everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little...and eat better pizza."
53,2,Negative,"normally we love papa john's, but they don't deliver to our place.  we really wanted pizza so ordered carryout from what we thought was the middleton store.  our mistake we ordered from here.  that's ok.  it was our mistake.

however, this store is insanely hard to find and get to and there is zero parking outside for carryout.  we ordered online from another store and the order stated it would be ready in 45 minutes.  it gave us a time.  it actually took longer than 45 minutes to weave through the square and finally park illegally in an alley behind the store while the husband went to get said pizzas.  they were just putting them in the oven.  so we had to wait another twenty minutes and staff wasn't apologetic, just rude stating that the pick up time is an estimate.

the pizza was fine.  it was fresh and stayed warm on an eighty degree day until we were home to eat it.  but....it's not worth the trip and while i gave no real issues with it taking an hour plus to be ready for carryout during a busy time of day  that should be acknowledged ahead of time."
54,1,Negative,the most disgusting pizza i have ever eaten.  nothing but salt and no cheese.  ugh...will never order from them again!
55,2,Negative,"pretty average spot. 

italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you. i had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. they've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. 

service was adequate. 

is baldwin street actually good?"
56,1,Negative,"we ordered this monday night after a busy work day. generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. not this time. i got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. i phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. i explained how i didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. they proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. i honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. i am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. violently awful and lasted for days now. please beware..."
57,1,Negative,"i was so excited for my sons 2nd bday party. it was aweful!! the host was everything but a host. a guest passed out cake and my husband stood at the door to hand out goodie bags. my party was from 4-6 and at 5:30 she started cleaning around people making it very awkward and guests left early. she was wearing a lower cut dress and i now have her cleavage in the pictures of my son blowing out his candles. 
when i booked the party i was told that each child gets 2 pieces of pizza, they actually get 1 slice cut in half. i had 15 children and 2 babies, i was charged extra for the babies even though they never left their mothers arms. she wasnt a kid friendly person and would just hollar out that it was time for cake or pizza, getting nobodys attention i was forced to round up the kids and get them seated. she started a ""soda tab"" and they charge $1 for a can of soda. at the end of the party i had spent $100 more than planned on sodas, extra pizza and the ridiculous 18% gratuity that was added on to my bill. a $45 tip was not what i had in mind for her. when calling the owner to discuss my issue she did nothing to resolve it and might have well just called me a liar because she defended the host to the very end. i will not recommend toy town to anyone!! bad business!!!!"
58,1,Negative,"ordered 5 pizzas at 11 for 11:45 pickup confirmed waiting for 25 minutes and pizza still not ready. 
got an ""oh sorry"".  

i watched 5 customers leave.  one said, "" let's go for office max we stand a better chance of getting food."""
59,2,Negative,we went for dinner and it was alright. the bruschetta was the best part of the meal! the pizza was soggy and the quinoa salad was alright.
60,1,Negative,"every once in a while i love to remind myself as to why i don't order delivery from chain pizza places like domino's, pizza hut, papa john's, etc. sometimes i'm pleasantly surprised and tonight i was not. 

over an hour and a half delivery time and i received a soggy medium pan pizza. but what had me most concerned is that my pizza was pulled out of the oven and checked at 6:35ish and was sitting there for over 45 min before it left the store. 

after delivery fees and tips for $16 i recommend eating a frozen pizza because at least you can pull it out when it's actually done baking. me, didn't have access to an oven. otherwise i know what i would've done. baked a pizza."
61,2,Negative,"do yourself a favor: order carry out, not delivery. i order here like twice a month, but about 1/3 of the time i order delivery they attempt to deliver my pizza to the wrong apartment. 

not sure why their drivers can't plug my address into google maps and figure out where i am. the staff at this location have proven to be incredibly incompetent and i am sick of giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances."
62,2,Negative,"wow i have been here four or five times. the first couple were a few months ago and i thought the pizza and pasta was great! i'm from chicago and appreciated having this nearby. well i'm not sure what happened but the past three times in the last two months are unacceptable. just bad. first visit -- watery spaghetti and meatballs. it was marginally ok ... i ate it. the garlic bread was ... terrible, i could have made better with wonder bread and garlic salt which is basically what it was ... second time, i waited in line and their computer system went down it was a friday night and they had no clue what to do... i forgave them for this, it happens but they could have written down my order and made my pizza ... they were completing orders and had other customers they just decided to freak out and not take mine, how did people order pizza and pay before computers? i had cash too. third time tonight is just unacceptable. i don't eat a lot of pizza or carbs, when k to it's a treat ... i just spent $35 for a take and bake pizza (it was not cooked) and eggplant parmesan (which was surprisingly ok) but the garlic bread was also not cooked. when i say this stuff was not cooked i mean it was not cooked. i had to break out my toaster oven which i did not appreciate. terrible. i guess i have to find a new place or stick with due forni even though they are not really a take out place, huge disappointment i was hungry... 3 strikes you are out."
63,1,Negative,"the pizza was burn over cooked. we eat three slices and make up no taste to it. would not recommend this place for their pizza. at the end we asked for a box, the staff make us a small container for more than a half of a pizza. not even a pizza box ."
64,1,Negative,"we found this place several years ago and had some family with us. we ordered pizza, salad and garlic knots. everything was so delicious. we visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. last night proved it will be the last time. a 16' pizza is now $20 or more. all the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. they only have one size pizza. we ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. we asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. we have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time.  ordered 6 wings $6.50 for 6 wings
 they were very good. we asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. we got charged .60c for a souffle cup. nope that was it. so very dissatisfied overall. service was mediocre. guess all customers will have to pay for the minimum wage hike, tipping no longer needed."
65,1,Negative,"when i got home to eat my pizza it barely had any cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni. next time i'll pay the extra fee for more toppings, if i ever from here again."
66,1,Negative,"the last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food. we decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour. three hours later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, ""we got busy, we can't help it"". i can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! and we're less than 5 miles down durango from them. the food is decent, but we won't be ordering from them again. don't waste your time."
67,1,Negative,the staff was super nice and delivery was quick. however for three large pizzas it was over $72. the pizzas were plain with no flavor. looked beautiful but zero spice
68,2,Negative,"after hearing so many people in the area raving about folco's i finally decided to try it out. and we were looking for a reception spot for a baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  i was disappointed about the food. the veal parmigiana was sub-par. too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. my husband tried a pasta dish which was ""ok"" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. the drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste i was hoping to get out of it. the caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. their tomato sauce - homemade i was told - tastes like something out of a jar. i was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the italian restaurant across the street. i was hoping to go back & try out their pizzas, but there is a much better italian restaurant in the garden basket plaza that makes everything from scratch and i have been a regular of theirs since they opened."
69,1,Negative,"if i had to rate this place on pizza alone, this review would be a lot different.

first of all, i have had a $5 off an order of $20 or more coupon for.. well, i can't even tell you how long. every time i call to place an order, they give me some new bs excuse as to why i can't use my coupon. (""oh, we already ran your card"" which, well, why the fuccccccc would you do that? and i'm sure if i wanted to add something to my order, that would be justtttt fine. or ""well, the you can't use that with the family deal,"" in which case, why the heck isn't that written on the coupon? that's really something that should be in the fine print.)

then tonight, my family in from out of state decides on pizza and wings... and regardless of the stupidity of their employees (""well, the family deal does come with two two liters,"" ""uh, no it doesn't... it comes with one..."" ""welll i am looking at it right here and it says two liters."" really? yes. one bottle is two liters. derrrrrrp.) their pizza happens to be some of my fave. so we order pizza and wings, and we ask for medium wings with extra wing hot sauce on the side. instead, we get a vat of ranch and wings that are dryer than betty white's.... well, yanno."
70,2,Negative,"the pizza is good, a little limited in variety, but that is the traditional thing, i guess. does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out."
71,1,Negative,"poor service. terrible food. soggy and undercooked, no understanding of the problem. 
took 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza. had our money refunded the food was so terrible."
72,1,Negative,"visited this place on november 19th 2016, which is national adoption day, and the service was horrible. the cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly. we had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate. as we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn't have to move just yet. at that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven't even received our food at the time. the food came out sporadically as we'd get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last. this place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business."
73,1,Negative,absolute garbage. 0 stars. flies crawling all over the slices. smells gross. pizza barely had any tomato sauce. pepperonis were like the ones from a lunchable. cheese is plastic crap. i'm royally pissed off & papa ceo would be too!!!!!! gross!
74,1,Negative,"we ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  horrible customer service.  if the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  better yet, never order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!"
75,1,Negative,ok so they charge a lot just for a single slice of pizza but what gets me is they charge a lot for what looks like old pizza that they reheat just to give to you which is one messed up and two gross i recommend going to paris casino and go to la pizza same price but man is it worth it the pizza at that place was amazing definitely worth the walk and and use your money for better food!
76,1,Negative,"what went wrong is the service. we called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away. an hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person. so it's either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves. we were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted. this is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later...."
77,1,Negative,great childhood memories but absolutely horrible pizza & customer service tuesday night! if i could leave no stars i would. both our pies had no cheese or at least not enough to be considered pizza. when we called to complain the young man did not want to hear it & firmly stated all ingredients are weighed out period. left my name & # for the manager/owner to call me (because he was too busy) and still have received nothing. i will never go back
78,2,Negative,"i just don't get it.  why is this a local favorite?  the pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  i also ordered the chicken parmesan with linguine.  the chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.  they don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.  i'd eat at carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.  the search for good pizza in phoenix continues."
79,1,Negative,"reading previous posts, obviously people who like this place have never been to any decent pub whatsoever.... with that being said this place is never busy, especially during the day, and for decor wise it looks like a hospital with the wall paper ... food is mediocre but always frozen ya i can tell.... with that being said its no wonder why there is never anyone in there personally is rather have shitty service at madison's or boston pizza or actually the black bull pub but atleast the food is fresh and 9c wings at the black bull"
80,1,Negative,the service was super slow. they had maybe 5 people inside and another 15 outside and we had to wait close to an hour for our pizza we never got. wouldn't suggest if you're hungry.
81,1,Negative,i love pizza 73s pizza. but this place uses the same spatula to spread the sauces on the pizza. many times when ordering a creamy garlic based sauce because i have a tomato allergy. i have found tomato sauce mixed in with the creamy garlic. not impressed
82,2,Negative,"this was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. 

we came in around 1:30 on a sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. my wife and i decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. as we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. she then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? so we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish.

over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving. after a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! i was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. we ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. we both did not want any more! when our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. we may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!"
83,1,Negative,this was the worst pizza i have ever had. the cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. the crust was bland and hard. the price was right at $3.99 so i gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat.
84,1,Negative,ordered the pizza on my phone. it said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. went to pick it up. worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet. didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! i'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system? i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. i've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.
85,1,Negative,"after waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents i now know i should have kept waiting.   i expected a bit of a line but i was rushed through checking and they were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.   

we ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes.  and ordered a child's pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes. he got a thin crust. 

our deep dishes didn't come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the kids menu pizza and the thin crust. we were there over 3 hours.  oh and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it.  instead covered in olives which he hates.   

i regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much i love this place. the servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door.  save yourself the trouble of relying on their service. just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from chicago as this place doesn't deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set. 

""we swear 10 more minutes max and it's out"" waited another 20. 

this place doesn't deserve to wear the name."
86,1,Negative,i waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than i do... i ain't that mad but i just don't like getting diabetes. the customer service was good nothing bad to say .. but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds.
87,1,Negative,"we were honestly disappointed. when you go to a pizza place you expect at a minimum soda?? you can't drink beer there bc they have no liquor license so if you want a beer, you have to go next door and then they bring you your pizza.. and if you want something besides tap water with no ice, you get a choice of 3 seltzer waters..: with no ice. seriously so weird. i ended up going next door to the coffee shop just to get a coke. the pizza was okay, the service was terrible.. nobody came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, give us menus etc. for just opening up... we were disappointed."
88,2,Negative,one of the worst pizza i had . they did not even bother to make the pizza correct for me. overpriced . i would prefer blaze anyday.
89,1,Negative,wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought ...wth sbarro?  now mediocre isn't even bad enough u have to go sub par with it... smh
90,1,Negative,wife and i both got sick over their pizza.  it didn't taste right.  i did like the peppers they use.  but that's the only nice thing i have to say.
91,1,Negative,the pizza was not that remarkable.it came barely warm. one person in our party ordered a chicken wrap and as the rest of us finished our pizza the wrap still had not been served. we eventually cancelled it . the staff was apologetic .
92,2,Negative,"new italian restaurant. they make their own sauce and pasta ""everyday"" according to the waitress who served us. food was okay. garlic bread sold as ""charity bread"" was very tasty....apparently net proceeds are donated to some charity. 

because it is new....staff are inexperienced. they brought out a water bottle which they couldn't open...served us a pizza called ""americano"" instead of coffee americano (not sure why they thought we'd order 4 main dish for 3 people)...and when the coffee came, they forgot about cream which we had to ask for...by the time we got the cream...coffee was cold. still charged us full price, whopping 4 bucks for a very small amount of coffee...4oz maybe less. 

we were entertained for a while by the mishaps, but found the overall experience underwhelming. decent ambiance, louder music than i'd like, service can be significantly improved."
93,1,Negative,"my daughter ordered a large pizza and 8 wings online. the delivery came and it turned out to be a small pizza and 16 wings. when i called the store and asked them to review the order #, they read the order we received. i explained that's not what my daughter ordered, to which they replied, she must've hit the wrong buttons and proceeded to hang up. if i wanted to order another pizza, don't you think that would be a perfect opportunity to rectify the problem???  nope!!!  when my wife called back, casey the manager was extremely rude and offered nothing but a customer service phone number. we will never order from papa john's again... no matter where the location."
94,1,Negative,ordered a pizza a few weeks ago & have to say it was horrible. it seemed almost raw. the crust was cooked but the cheese was white not the golden color on a good pizza. it's a shame because it's so close to home. we've had food from there before but it's been awhile & it use to be good. i guess i'll be sticking with rocco's because they are always consistently good.
95,1,Negative,"um caliente seriously!?!

so after work i decided to order a pizza a pie. nothing too crazy. a red pizza by my definition is a pizza with red sauce on it. apparently, not this time. anywho i ordered a red pizza with parmesan on the side and garlic sauce.

i received: cheese with extra red sauce. no parmesan, and some weird sauce with green stuff in it maybe it cilantro/basil i don't know. plus it was undercooked! thats kind of a trifecta of badness by my definition. i dont know. i would like to say this was the first time i've received an undercooked pizza which i had to send back but alas it is my third.

caliente, whats going on?!?! i'm confused, bewildered, baffled even. step your game up or else giovanni's is more than welcome to take my money anyday."
96,1,Negative,"customer service here is terrible. i ordered a pizza on my way home from a 40 min drive, realizing i forgot my purse at work when i went to pick it up. no offer to look up my card number or anything so who knows what happened with the food - hopefully it did not go to waste. after about an hour and a half when i was on my way home again at 9:40, 20 min away, i called again to order, the person on the phone kept hitting buttons and telling me the disruption was on my end and in between the loud beeps, asked me if i could be there by 10 because they close their doors at 10. needless to say, i said forget it and placed my second order at one of the many nearby stores that keep their doors open way past 10 pm on a friday night. and when i drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the employees were standing around talking in the parking lot. must have had important things to do. won't be ordering from them again."
97,2,Negative,"over priced and under delivers!
- a 12 inch pizza was likely only 10 inch.
- it barely fed the two of us.
- tasted okay (definitely nothing to brag about)
- at $25, this was definitely not worth the price!
- won't be ordering from there again."
98,1,Negative,"ordered a hawaiian pizza, got half hawaiian,half cheese, and half burnt.
they vaguely describe that their ""sandwiches"" are calzones. they're kind of good."
99,1,Negative,the wings are not like they used to be seems like frozen cheap wings from walmart and the prices went way up thx to new law of 10hr i've been ordering from here now for 5 years but i want be no more not worth the extra money the pizza was ok but not great like in the past
100,2,Negative,"giordano's is a well known chicago restaurant that's famous for their chicago style stuffed deep dish pizza. they also offer hand stretched thin crust pizza and crispy extra thin pizza. on the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more.

on yelp i read about the long wait times so i planned to try them when they opened. at that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. we were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare. 

we shared an entree sized harvest salad. the salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. this salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it.

during our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. i found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality.

just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering.

i received my individual stuffed plain pizza. the pizza wasn't sliced all the way through and i found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. kinda like a rock. the crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. the very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. although i found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that i found inedible. i don't know if the crust i received is typical of giordano's or not. 

my husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. he said that he was glad that he wasn't hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. he did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the ""other"" chicago place uses.

i really liked the atmosphere and i really enjoyed the well trained servers i encountered.

i would never go back for the pizza i received."
101,2,Negative,"i'm sad to write this review, because i'm actually obsessed with caliente's hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad i feel that i can no longer give them my business! every time i order i get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time i call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes.... and every time it is late. last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair. but, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? if that was the only time this sort of thing happened, i would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time i went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well. maybe it's a training problem... a hiring problem?

pros:
+pizza is good

cons:
-slow inattentive service
-slow delivery
-general lack of concern about the happiness of their patrons"
102,1,Negative,i just moved to the area and i have ordered from this location twice... both times our hand tossed pizza showed up as a thin crust! i have ordered this same pizza at our other location several times and the thickness was perfect! our pizza was so thin that it could not even stay together on the ride over. guess i'll try the local papa johns.
103,1,Negative,terrible! this was unfortunately the we worst pizza i have had in a long time! i am staying at the wonderful andaz resort across the street. i thought i would get a quick pizza and bring it back to the room. i am so disappointed. we are ordering from one of the large chains so we can fix our pizza craving now.  sad...small...thin...pitiful pizza. you will notice that i never leave bad reviews but this time i have to. yuck!!!!! i wasted $18 plus a $2 tip!
104,2,Negative,"just ordered and holy smokes i've never seen the delivery time like this one, 65 to 75 minutes. wow they need to step their game because this is becoming not worth the wait at all not to mention it's a hit or miss if the pizzas cooked good or not disappointed"
105,1,Negative,"this will be my last time here. pizza is full of a ton of grease. the guys who make the pizza use their bare hands, then toggle back and forth to the cash register. last night my pizza was just a puddle of grease, its not even edible. their prices are outrageously expensive for the quality. its the closest to my house but i think the pizza at the 7-11 is better quality now. this place has really gone down the tubes. its just not what it used to be. a friend told me the one on s. buffalo is the real roccos to go. something about a bad break up between then two guys. i also spent 18 bux on a veal parm sub. seems a little pricey for the sub. it was good but not 18 dollar worth good. their pizza is just a greasefest. it must just be really low end cheese to create that. my recommendation would be to go to bambinos or east side for quality pizza. if you want really low end stuff that is over priced, come here and get some pizza that just sits out all day."
106,2,Negative,"it surprises me what celebrity chefs are willing to put their name on. riva is a poolside (all outdoor) restaurant at the venetian. we went here for lunch and i was completely underwhelmed by the choices on the menu and by the food itself. really? this is what a celebrity chef comes up with? sad.

very few choices so you better want a pizza, a club sandwich, or a standard salad. that's it. my daughter had the cheese pizza. i had the club sandwich, which came with fries. and i got a strawberry colada swirl. $60 later, we called that a lunch and left. i could have gotten that anywhere. why on earth would that be what wolfgang puck offered up? seems crazy to me.

if you want to overspend on something you can get better at your local diner...come here."
107,2,Negative,"i wanna like this place more. fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza. but the delivery times are sooo bad. worst i've ever experienced anywhere. they are always and forever late. and for the life of me, i can't understand why they can't keep up. every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour. i've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! how is the bad delivery the only thing consistent?? fix it!"
108,2,Negative,"i had such an awful experience. i've never been here before or had their food. i ordered through the phone for pick up. i was rushed to get my order in and the lady tried to hang up on me before i could even ask for the total amount (since i don't know the total with tax). 

i went by to pick the order, was greeted fine. i tell this balding older man i'm here for a pick up. he asks, ""the two pizzas?"" i said yes with a salad. he then cuts me off mid sentence to say, ""yeah yeah whatever."" he goes to the back to get the salad so i look through the menu one more time and he comes back to tell me, ""move where i can see you."" 

i will never come here again. this serve was down right awful and what made it worse, i was with my 6yr old brother and he had to sit through and listen to this. the pizza is not even that good!"
109,2,Negative,"quick review:  food:  delicious.  service:  poor.  slow.  

five of us tried lucille today for lunch.  we were seated quickly and served our drinks relatively quickly.  but, we waited well over an hour and a half for our food.  lunch should not take nearly two hours.  patrons will not go here for lunch if they think it will take more than an hour.  

our wait staff seemed inexperienced.  please train the staff before you open.

our party had both the detroit panned pizza and the neapolitan wood-fired pizza, the lunch pizza.  we all enjoyed the salad that comes with the lunch.   not quite to the standards of pizza brutta, but very good.   pizza and a very good salad for $10 is a great value.  

i know the place is new and i will try again.   but, service needs major improvement.  i really want to like this place."
110,2,Negative,"we had a menu shoved under our door. so we only thought to look at it. wished we had looked at yelp first. 
1) ordered the special: 2x 1 topping pizzas. we ordered pepperoni and pepperoni. we received one sausage and one pepperoni. 
2) we ordered cheese bread: it was ok. nothing amazing, a more flat pizza crust than pudgier bread sticks. 
3). we ordered fried mushrooms. these were pretty good. we received 11 in the order. 
4) we were not eligible for the free soda because we had ordered a special (which sucks. 
5) we ordered a 2 l of diet coke and a 6 pack. saying ""diet coke"" each time. 
i even told the story about how this is a pepsi town and we needed our diet coke. 
what arrived?  off brand diet cola. 
...
we picked this place bc of the diet coke written on the menu and the implicit guarantee of the guy taking the order. 

side note:  the menu says ""under new management"". 

i feel i can say this sucks under new management. 

review of the pizza:  it was 2 pizzas for 21$. it tasted like a 10$ pizza. so i'm ok w it. 

...just to prove i'm not crazy i'm going to post a pick of the words diet coke...

so:  1 star for getting it here in 30 min (guy said 30-45 min, and it was a dinnertime delivery on the strip) and 1 star bc the food taste met the price."
111,1,Negative,"ordered for delivery and was told to expect a 40 minute wait, after an hour and a half our cold pizza's arrived. 
 the meat lovers pizza contained tasteless greasy italian sausage, soggy pepperoni, and cold crusty ham slices in extremely sparing amounts.
 the grilled steak chipotle pizza came completely without sauce. nothing better than a cold dry pizza.
 would not recommend to my worst enemies."
112,1,Negative,worst customer service ever ! driver first got our order wrong three times and had to keep returning to switch out our pizza then our mozzarella sticks then we got the wrong 2 liter. driver then offers a meal on her for all the inconvenience and doesn't fall thru with her offering. every time we order from them our order is always wrong. i'd rather go to dominos !
113,2,Negative,"avoid this place! i ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20! ridiculous. no one that was making the pizza mentioned that each topping was extra. i started off with a $7.99 pizza! how in the world did those little toppings add $12.00! workers are all incompetent. i was shocked when i received my total. i told the cashier that all the other make your own pizza places don't charge extra for toppings. the cashier's response was uhhhhh i just moved here from out of state. he looked like a deer in the headlights. i told him i'm never coming back. no offer to keep a first timer happy or even get a manager after it was obvious that this was a deal breaker for me.

to be fair the pizza was good and the decor is very well done inside. go to mod or pieology instead."
114,1,Negative,"one of the very worst pizza hut's i have ever dealt with. they messed up my order, promised me a $15 credit in return, and then rob and tatiana refused to honor the credit. their customer service skills were laughable. rather than giving me a free cheese pizza, rob spent 15 minutes on the phone interrogating me. and tatiana seems to have never had a customer service job prior to this in her entire life. i ended up going to domino's pizza, where i got much better service for the same price."
115,1,Negative,"i've forgiven their rudeness over the phone many times, basically because i am able to order online. tonight my son forgot to order one of our pizzas online and they gave him so much grief about adding to the order that i finally took the phone. asked the guy if we could add to the order, or at least have 2 online orders delivered at the same time. i get on the phone and this jack wagon says ""it's not magic, ma'am!"" ummm not asking for magic. he hung up on me. solid business skills. cancelled my order and got dominos. learn some people skills, you idiots"
116,1,Negative,"a large pizza with sausage (more like pepperoni), mushroom and green peppers for 30$????  are you kidding me?"
117,1,Negative,nasty! i was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews.  just went to nyc in oct so wanted to compare.  sorry not ny style pizza.
118,2,Negative,"moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. tried this place out. family owned, which i like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. the single large pizza i ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and i took it home. it was plenty hot when i returned home, and that's great. the problem is.. it wasn't very good. the sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. i'd put it on par with papa john's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment."
119,1,Negative,"first visit to this location and am extremely disappointed.  sad to know who served me is now getting 10/hr. i know someone could provide a way better customer experience than this person did for the same amount of money.  if i was a business owner i'd be firing a crew like this as i'd lose out on business.  

first of all i arrived to find a hand drawn note on the door stating sorry we will open at 11, when they should have opened at 10:30a. 

second they opened after 11 and the guy had no customer service once he unlocked the door.  once i  entered nothing was said to me i simply stood near the register waiting to be acknowledged.  the guy decided to continue working behind the registers while his coworker stood around and snacked on something before i eventually was acknowledged.  

thirdly, once i was acknowledged the guy asked what he could get for me.  i said i would like 3 hot and readys please.  he said my total  and then walked away before i could pay .  i continued to wait while he left me at the registers and went in the back area.  

fourthly,  i waited over 10 minutes watching him stack up multiple pizza boxes with pizzas,   put stickers on pizza boxes,  placed finished pizzas in the warmers,  watched his co worker  had off a pizza to someone who just drove up to the drive through all while i still stood there waiting.  

fifthly, a third co worker eventually arrived and i asked her why that person received their order before me?
she went to the back and words were said between her and the coworkers and she just disappears.  

finally the guy brings me my order stands at the register and just stares at me... i ask him  oh are you ready for me to pay now??  he says yes and the total.  

if i didn't have  a hard working team i wanted to appreciate i would have just left.  i chose to go through this experience to the end and now here i am. . i hope the owners read this and take discipline on those employees.  if you don't believe me.  check your cameras."
120,1,Negative,"this pizzeria place is terrible. the service was rude and they refused to let us eat our food at the table due to ""health code rules"". we were told that we could eat outside! we were able to order drinks but were told rudely several times that we could not have our pizza until we left the premises. very unacceptable imho"
121,2,Negative,"i guess if you are truly desperate than this will serve a purpose. just don't keep your expectations high.

we had guests in town and they were gambling it up in the d and didn't want to leave. we just wanted to sneak away and slam dunk something quick so we weren't hungry. so, in that sense, it served its purpose.

we got the 5.99 ""special"" of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. the pizza was obviously microwaved and very much like ""michaelina"" type ""pizza"" you would buy in a grocery store. i mean..i held it down, but it was nothing special. the drink was pretty pitiful too...probably around the 12- 16 oz variety.

plus, how can you serve food and not have a public restroom? isn't that a violation of some sort??? seriously?

if you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into...

2 stars."
122,2,Negative,ordered two pizzas sunday about 1:20.  they told my wife it would be 45 min. after almost 2 hrs. the pizza showed up. we had called about 2:30 and asked where our pizza was. they told us it was in it's way and they would credit the money back to our card. pizza was cold and kids were starving. not calling them again.
123,1,Negative,"we tried to call ahead to order a pizza.  no answer after several attempts and we thought this may be because of monday night football.  my husband goes to pick up knowing he'll have to wait because they never ever have ""hot and ready"" any time of any day.  he places the order and the employee rings up the wrong thing.  my husband corrects him, and 3 or 4 orders are placed after my husband's order.  my husband watches the employee put the other orders in the oven.  he then comes over to my husband and again asks what it is he wanted.  my husband repeats the order.

after waiting and not paying close attention (mistake on his part, but then again...) the employee asks again what we wanted as he hands the box to my husband.  he of course comes home with the wrong product.  we had ordered the 5 meat pizza that is $9 in the tv commercials and received stuffed crust pepperoni.

we tried to call back and of course no answer.  this did not surprise us as we encountered this before going to the shop, and they did not even attempt to answer the phone while my husband was in the shop.  i shot off a message to the company while my husband made a return trip to try to rectify the situation.  i was told to take my comment to customer support.  i tried and the site froze on the 3rd page.  so, the whole company more or less ""backed up"" the bad service received at the shop.

upon return, the employee got sarcastic with my husband insisting the product received was correct even after seeing the evidence that it was not.  we were able to keep the mistake but only received a $5 pizza as more or less an apology when we had ordered a higher-priced product.  

in the end we received 2 incorrect products.  the first had to be reheated.  it was mediocre at best when eaten but now has me ill with heartburn and stomach cramps.  i guess it's safe to say both the pizza and the customer service have left very bad tastes in my mouth."
124,1,Negative,"i don't see the point. it is a mess and ugly which fair enough is not news to anyone but now prices are high and not competitive. the same pizza is cheaper at no frills, shoppers and lango's! and of course everything is strewn around in ugly fashion forget it"
125,2,Negative,"the service was fast. great pizza. however, as someone with a shellfish allergy, i find it frustrating that this is yet another restaurant where cross-contamination is apparently an issue to the point where everything is grilled together, fried together, and so on."
126,1,Negative,"worst service. overcharged - and lied to over and over again while the delivery guy tried to think of a reason to stick. there is no reason a medium pizza that's 14.99 on your website should come to $25 before tip - especially when that's not what i was quoted on the phone. 

my own fault for ordering from dominos in a moment of apartment packing craziness."
127,2,Negative,"hey sauce! 
i heard some friends talking about how great your pizza was so i took the wife out to your restaurant last night to give it a try. i thought i'd provide you with our feedback as i have a feeling many other people may be feeling the same way we did about our experience. lets start off with the good, the pizza was really good, our server was really good, the price of the food was decent, but that's kind of where it ends. our first real impression of the place was when we were handed our menu's, both our menu's were beyond greasy and dirty and had food stuck to them, they were dingy/had bent corners and some of the paper had ripped off both of the menus this is a sign that nobody cares to wipe down the menus, and if nobody cares to even wipe down the menus it makes me wonder what else do they not wipe down regularly. when sitting around and taking in the whole atmosphere of the place, we felt it was a little dark and the restaurant as a whole needed to be wiped down. the garlic knots were really good, i still have mixed feelings about them, because most places that sell garlic knots dust them in parmesan cheese powder and some sort of garlic powder, and that's what i was kind of expecting here, but here i got fresh parmesan cheese and fresh chunks of garlic on top, don't get me wrong fresh is great but it was an ongoing battle to keep the garlic chucks and parmesan on top of the knot while eating it, where as if it were the parmesan powder i feel it would have stuck better and not have been so much work. the sauce that came with the garlic knots was amazing. normally i like my garlic knots dipped in ranch, but i definitely liked your sauce over ranch last night. as far as your pizza goes it's really good. let me start by saying i haven't found a place in the vegas area that does pizza like yours, the thickness of the dough etc. we are transplants from california a little over a year ago and we've been on the hunt for a pizza with a crust like that. that's how 90% of all pizza places are in southern california do it so that's what we've grown to like. everything we have tried out here has seemed to try to spin off of new york thin style crust, so thank you for being a breath of fresh air for that. the pizza was hot when it came out as it should have, but for the life of me every slice i ate all the toppings would slide right off the crust, i felt like i might as well be eating a pizza casserole lol i thought that maybe everything was just too hot, but from the time i ate my first slice to the time i ate the last one, a good 15 minutes had passed and still the same situation. in regards to your soda glasses, you are using samuel adams pint glasses i think they were, these things were very frustrating, first of all not everyone likes beer and if you want to attract more families to your restaurant having every soda glass be a beer pint isn't very family friendly, but the most annoying part is every time i had a refill (at least 3 times) the ice was stuck in that center section and would drop to the bottom of the glass, just something to think about. over all i liked the food, but all the other issues combined really make me want to rate you as 2 out of 5 stars. i was really hoping your restaurant would be added as a ""usual place"" for my wife and i but i think it's going to be in the once in a blue moon category. i hope business continues to grow for you guys and that you can dial down these little things and thrive as a business. thanks again for the good food last night and good luck!"
128,2,Negative,"i love the pizza, but i've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. the first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (i think) were pretty bad. i had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. it was cold so we decided to eat inside. the smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. the pizza was good, but i don't think i'll be going back."
129,1,Negative,delivery was nice. fries had a bucket of salt on them. me and my brother gagged!!!hummus wasn't fresh. your sausage  pizza was rotten. tasted like mold...terrible terrible food!!!!
130,1,Negative,so i couldn't tell you what gus' pizza tastes like because they wanted a $7 service charge (before tip) on an $11 order to deliver anything.  classic craphole that will be out of business soon.
131,1,Negative,"this place is a wet, dirty diaper.
the dirty food matches its dirty neighborhood. 
their slow drivers on oxy can't figure directions from a mile away. when delivered, their pizza was lukewarm and tasted what i assume was old lady's socks. this food will give raccoons nightmares.
perfect food to give to an enemy or gf you are breaking up with."
132,2,Negative,"food was ok, not the best just ok. service could have been better, we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and garlic knots... they brought out everything and forgot the wings! and never even told us anything about how long it would be, we finished the pizza and knots before the wings even came! we where told that they forgot to put them in! bs! and the manager never even came over to apologize.... horrible customer service!"
133,1,Negative,"worst delivery service in the las vegas pizza market.  the first time i ordered pizza it took 1 hour and 30 minutes to get my pizza.  this time i ordered, told them on the phone i would pay cash and they show up and tell me they don't have change for my 2 twenty dollar bills.  really?  what a mess this place is.  i have no idea how they stay in business.  time for me to give some of the other places a try."
134,1,Negative,"pass this place- the food and service here were awful. 

we came into this place with a reservation when we arrived in vegas in september and right off the bat were not greeted at all. we should have known from there the experience would be bad. 

we sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food and drinks- after our drinks came, which were blah, our food  finally came. we ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs. 
the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

the meatball was just ok. nothing to write home about. 

when our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. she then said in a very rude tone that ""that is how it is and that is normal for all pizza"". i was offended with that remark. she has no idea what kind of pizza is normal if she thinks that was normal. 

any who, the manger came over and had a very similar attitude. 

we paid our expensive tab and left- never to return, as i urge you to do the same."
135,1,Negative,"the positives: staff was friendly and the beer was cold. that's it. 

two kids spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing. noodles were cooked fine, the meatballs were small and bland, and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the noodles let alone the entire plate. and for $6 each that's ridiculous. 


we order the mama's supreme pizza. the order took well over 30 min for the pizza. half the crust was burnt. the toppings were limited and the flavor was blah.  

very disappointed and won't be returning."
136,2,Negative,"the last time i was at hot rocks, i had the most interesting and delicious pizza experience.  if i had written a review that time i would have given it 5 out of 5.  oddly, i hadn't been back in quite a while until just recently.   

this time i ordered the macedonian  pasta with a starter green salad.  the salad was unique... but not good at all. it was waaayyy  overdressed. it tasted like every ingredient had been pickled  and then doused in lemon juice. i couldn't handle more than a couple mouthfuls before i gave up. 

the pasta... looked good.... sounded good.. but again was overdressed. there was so much dried basil in the sauce.. and instead of a light pesto.. the dish was swimming in oil. i'm not kidding. it was more like oil soup with penne noodles.  

i'm was supremely disappointed.  but i will say the service was excellent. the server did come by and asked how everything was but i didn't have the courage to send my food back... 

not saying this place doesn't know how to do pizza... and maybe i came on a bad night..  but i would be wary of ordering the pasta and salad."
137,2,Negative,"bleh.

maybe their pizza slices + pop deals are decent value, but my standard medium regular pizza (plus pineapple - yum!) was only a teeny tiny marginally fractionally  bit nicer than the same order at the neighbouring pizza pizza, but three dollars more expensive.

i'm also pretty sure one of the staff members who dealt with me was high. 

judge me all you like, but i'll head back to pizza pizza next time."
138,2,Negative,"if you're looking for cheap, i guess this is the place.  

they serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  there's a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.

the two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  they had a variety of pizza to choose from.  while the pizza looked really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.  it really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (i didn't see them making it, but i wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.

the place really isn't meant for ""pizza snobs"" to enjoy a quality pie.  it's meant to be a cheap alternative to mcdonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, ""macaroni and cheese pizza"" as one of the types).

there were teens and families with small children everywhere.  i was the only person not there with someone under 18."
139,1,Negative,"cashier takes my order for (the last of) cheese pizza while i wait in line to buy cigarettes. 
woman ahead is told her total, her response ""oh yea i forgot, can i get that cheese pizza"" 
why ask me if you're going to make me wait? i didnt forget to order, she did. she should have had to wait. university student vs an employee on a limited break. which was explained to her, minimum wage doesnt inspire much care for the customer... fuck this spot"
140,2,Negative,"first, it took about 5 minutes of waiting before we were even noticed. then the host told us just to sit wherever (why have a podium and a host if tou have open seating?) our host said it would be another 15 minutes because they stoke the fire at 4, but when we sat down our waiter said it would be 45 minutes. we waited and when we got our pizza it was extremely soggy, we couldnt even hold it without one hand on the bottom. our waiter only showed up once to half fill my water. overall not a good experience. go to a different grimaldi's"
141,2,Negative,the wait is ridiculous even for being busy. there was an hour before our pizza even went into oven. no pizza is really that worth it. i've had better.
142,2,Negative,"not impressed with this place at all!

i've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time.  the sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it.... very gross.  the gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible.  the maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular.   
and you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting.  i would pass on this one."
143,1,Negative,absolutely terrible service. our server was the most clueless guy. he told us that he didn't recommend the lasagna and the extra thin crust pizza. so i ordered anyways.  pizza was ok.  the lasagna tasted like the forest floor. this place is terrible.
144,2,Negative,"we ordered from this location last night for the first time in about 8 years. 

we got take out because we were busy and we wanted to take out some place close. we usually go to little joe's pizza as it is our favorite, but it would have been an additional 20 minutes and everyone was hungry now. 

on the phone, we ordered the family special. one large pepperoni and a large pineapple pizza with a side of cheesy bread sticks and a 2 liter bottle of pepsi. one we got home we discovered that their large size pizza was about 14"". little joe's pizzas large pizza is 16-18 inches so you can see our disappointment in the size of pizza huts pizza. the bread sticks were good. i liked their marinara dipping sauce. i didn't mind eating the pineapple pizza even though it seemed greasy and the crust was light and fluffy. the pepperoni tasted horrible which turned my husband off to ever ordering here again in any situation. 

i'm only giving it 2 stars due to the taste of the pepperoni pizza and the small size. for the same amount of money at little joe's pizza i could have fed 2 more people so i don't feel i got the best bang for my buck."
145,1,Negative,"we will never go to this sauce again. i ordered a salad and a pizza. we finished the salad and waited and waited for the pizza. i got up and asked the waitress if they forgot the pizza, she laughed and said yes that they forgot and it would be 10 min before we could get it.  she never apologized or offered to take some of the price off, nothing. just rude!!"
146,1,Negative,absolutely horrible!! messed up the order called back to get it fixed and they were rude about it... burnt the pizza and refused to replace it cuz a piece of it was missing... ordered a geek salad and was given italian and caesar dressing!! will not be ordering from them again!! terrible
147,1,Negative,"we ordered on a wednesday at around 5:30 pm. the order arrived by 6 and was fresh and hot. it was, however, missing the potato wedges which we called the store about. they were redelivered about 45 minutes later. after calling about the wedges (which my daughter really wanted, so she didn't eat), we realized one of the pizzas was missing half the toppings. decided not to call. the online ordering was good but does not allow for 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. not really family friendly.

sorry pizza 73, not gonna order again."
148,1,Negative,"i ordered one small pizza and one medium pizza directly off their menu with no special additions.  that is not what was delivered to my door.  this was late on a monday night too. not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.  

the real frustration came in trying to fix the order. after calling the place three times, i was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this.  they really need to work on the customer service. over two hours later i was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35.

while i can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since i ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks.  this place just lost my business. not worth the hassle.  i wish the best of luck to the rest of you!"
149,1,Negative,"i used to like their pizzas, but twice already i couldn't get in! first time, i get a rude employee saying that we aren't open! and tonight i rang the doorbell twice and i was ignored!

and another thing...why did you stop serving bacon on pizzas?"
150,1,Negative,"we ordered after edc last night, we got home and were starving and found their menu slipped under the door of our hotel room, it took over an hour to arrive, then when it got here it was 1 pizza short and we had 1 extra two-liter bottle of pepsi.

when we had ordered, the woman on the phone when we ordered, repeated our order back to us and it did include only 1 pepsi and 3 pizzas instead of the two we got.

i told the delivery guy we didn't order two bottles and he just gave me attitude and said: ""it's what the receipt says, it's just $3 more"".

i didn't care that it was just $3 more, my point was we did not want two pepsi's.

then when we called to complain the woman on the other end of the line also had a shitty attitude saying it wasn't their fault that they took the order wrong and that they're just human, mistakes happen.

they told us we could get the pizza we were missing but we would have to return the extra pepsi and pay the remainder of the cost of the pizza plus it would take another hour to arrive.

worst service and attitude ever."
151,1,Negative,"just got back! this is the third time in a row that pizza was burnt. not only mine but several others as well. also the garlic knots burnt. such a shame. i do not think i will be going back to this place now. how one cannot tell when something is burnt is beyond me. again this was the third time in a row.  heck, even the other person sitting at another table said their fries were burnt as well... open your eyes before you have no more locals coming!!!"
152,1,Negative,"what a freak show.  waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time.  another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter.  they carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm.  the guy he punched eventually waited on me.  i don't know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there.  great food.  creepy employees.  keep the recipe, get new help.  others witnessed this crap.  happened on thursday around 7:30 pm.  never again."
153,1,Negative,completely awful.   ordered a pizza and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the place was only 1/4 busy and they got it wrong twice.  we didn't realize the 2nd screw up until we got home.  we assumed after the 1st screw up and apology they'd get it right. the bartenders were dancing like they wanted to have fun but paid zero attention to our order.   will never go back.
154,1,Negative,order came cold and incorrect. ordered off grubhub. no fault with grubhub. won't order pizza from this restaurant again.
155,1,Negative,"i would like to give it no stars.  the pizza was burnt.  we ordered a cheese plate, and the only thing they got right was the olives (which is standard).  i had to ask for the flatbread that came with it.  we ordered one cheese and two meats... i got two cheeses and one meat and it wasn't even the meat that we ordered.  my cloth napkin had holes in it.  but the bartender is flirting with my boyfriend to make it right... this place sucks."
156,2,Negative,make sure you zero out the  tip area on your credit card slip when papa johns delivers ( used to be camfield corners now relocated to johnston rd.. )  .... 2 times now... someone between here & there added a tip to my debit card  purchase after getting a cash tip too.... i finally think hubby learned a lesson... !!!  papa johns offered us a couple free pizzas to rectify the situation.... ummmm no..... a 5 year customer has been lost ....and hungry howies has gained a new customer !
157,2,Negative,"nice people. very friendly.  provided some free garlic sticks while i waited for my pizza.  i took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    while the pizza was worth $10, i would've felt a little ripped off had i paid the normal price (closer to $18 i believe).  the dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- i found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places.  while there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just ""so-so"" such that i don't really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis.  such is the case here."
158,1,Negative,"ordered 2 larges. one all dressed one plain. received pepperoni instead of plain with giant air pockets. when called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy, i was told that it was a mistake. yes i agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with giant air pockets in it which is also 2 inches in diameter smaller than the large ordered in the box isn't a mistake, it was intentional. i have posted the picture. replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold. thank, never will we order here again."
159,1,Negative,"went here at 11:30 on a tuesday, most of their menu was not available. they said they had no toppings except cheese and pepperoni. the woman at the counter was not apologetic or anything. how can you advertise as a top vegas pizza place and only have two types of pizza a half hour after opening?

i'm vegan and we came here just for the pizza. not to pay for parking, walk all the way in and just get turned away. unacceptable. 

we asked if they'd have vegan pizza soon and they said ""maybe by dinner time.""

deserving of zero stars really."
160,2,Negative,"update:  i revisited the place today because i thought i'd give them a second chance, after all they are just opening.

their problem is that they haven't figured out how to do a wood-fired, thin-crust pizza.  while the toppings are very good, their pizza is greatly diminished because their crust isn't right.  great wood-fired crust should be a bit crisp on the bottom--but not burnt.  theirs is soggy.  i first went in during the evening.  this time i went in at lunch time.  there was a manager there this time who came by and asked how things were. i told her that the pizza wasn't great because the crust was soggy and tough.  she indicated that they weren't baking it long enough and would work with the cooks.  

imho, the difference between just average pizza and great pizza is in the crust.  it's easy to use fresh ingredients, not so easy to make a great crust.  this is where they are falling down.  hopefully time will tell if they get this one right, but for the cost ($15+) for a 6-slize pizza and a drink with a sub-par crust is too much to pay.

=====================================================================
it is obvious that the owners put a lot of money and effort into this place.  it is very nice inside.  the seating is comfortable and well decorated. 

however, decor alone does not a restaurant make.  when i first walked in i sensed a problem because the place smelled like burned popcorn.  i dismissed that and i ordered a pepperoni, kalamata and mushroom pizza.  pretty standard.  their first attempt came out with the crust totally cremated.  it was scorched on the top and incinerated on the bottom, yet the center was still raw.  i took it back and asked for a re-do.  the second attempt came out a little better, but the crust was just doughy, floppy as a dish rag and basically gross.   the toppings slid off into a pile of mush on my plate.  

i think the basic problem is that the place is being staffed by a bunch of young kids.  they have no idea what they are doing, and there is no management there to help.  they have a lot of money tied up in it,  and it is a shame that there is no one there to watch the shop."
161,1,Negative,"the pizza here is horrible. i've ordered it a few times because it's open 24/7 and let me tell you, it's bad. prices are great, but it doesn't make up for pizza that tastes like left over garbage dump pizza.

the delivery guys will never bring the pizza to my door. they make me walk out of my complex which is quite large. i order delivery for to the door delivery, not walk, balance two pizzas and a 2 liter while trying to type my door code in... no thanks.

i also had an issue, which will be my last time dealing with these idiots. i ordered a pizza, it was never delivered, and upper management is refusing to refund my credit card of the charge. they have been giving me the run around on the issue for over two weeks, and now they are flat out ignoring me, and refusing to refund me."
162,2,Negative,"i find that this pizza is edible but i am confused as to why so many people think it is so spectacular-it seems to be pretty standard delivery style pizza. they have a number of non-standard toppings and specialty pizzas so that might be part of the appeal to some but i prefer plain cheese or just one topping so the quality of the sauce, cheese and crust is most important. this pizza just seems very dough heavy to me which can result in sogginess-if you like thicker crust pizza you might like this place whereas if you like thin crust pizza you probably will not."
163,1,Negative,dominos is dominos. but when i walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. i had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after i ordered. this dominos is slow. drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. edit: our soda was flat. seriously go get ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one
164,1,Negative,"i guarantee this is the worst pizza you could ever get go to the supermarket buy a box of frozen pizza undercook it and there you have it the same taste you will get at this restaurant terrible disgraceful this should never be called the streets of new york because new york's pizza tastes nothing like this it is enormously much better in new york.

don't waste your money eating here"
165,1,Negative,pretty run of the mill bad pizza. tasted like re heated tombstone or other home made. but the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok.
166,2,Negative,"bad service, bland pizza, and really really overpriced. the whole night, we only saw our waitress maybe 3 times (not even busy, like four tables out of the whole place had people). with the pizza, there wasn't any pazzaz to it... very bland. and lastly; with two people and no appetizers or alcohol, the bill ended up being about $75. for those prices, i'd expect a much better experience. with service and food."
167,2,Negative,"take your pick: 
(sunday evening, party of 7)
-the absentee, surly waiter
-the water dripping from the a/c ducts into our heads
-the overly greasy pizza
-the ravioli literally sitting in oil
-the half-hearted oil & vinegar dipping mixture on the table
-the high prices
-the slow service, despite being one of only five parties dining
-the loud music that desperately screamed 'we're a cool restaurant...we promise!'"
168,2,Negative,"well i was hoping this place would blow my socks off, but alas, my socks stayed tightly in tact. i had been waiting for this place to open for a few weeks and been checking out the menu in the window and online (i'm at the golds every morning, not just a creepy window stalker). we finally got a chance to go a few weekends ago and man, was i disappointed. they were busy, which is expected on a friday night. we had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which we did but was super awkward. we ordered a few drinks and hit the menu. i ordered the deviled eggs and wifey got teh cheese plate. i went with the short ribs with blue cheese grits while wifey went with teh ricotta pizza with pork belly. the apps were done right, no complaints there. i liked the crispy bacon under the mix in the midle of the eggs, nice touch. the entrees, on the other hand, were sub par. my ""short rib"" dish was a large beef rib, and not a true short rib. i'm not that picky, but when i want short ribs, i want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky on a large stick. the glaze tasted good but after wrestling with the knife to cut off a few pieces, that was it. the grits were also bland, no blue cheese to be found. wifey's pizza should have read as pork belly pizza  and it would have been on point. now i know it sounds crazy to compain about too much pork belly, but the entire thing was pork belly and there was no ricotta to be found. it was also super salty and just not very good. the server comped my short ribs due to them being inedible, which was very gracious. i had high hopes for this place and will give it another shot. i'm hoping it doesn't go the way of st francis where it's got tons of potential, but simply can't deliver"
169,2,Negative,"ordered on my mobile app. when we got there, we paid and saw our pizza come out of the oven. waited 5 minutes before the guy behind the counter got around to give us our pizza that was clearly sitting on top of the oven. he was busy cleaning he said."
170,1,Negative,"man, does this place suck. trust the reviews! i ignored the negative ratings, and that was a mistake. i ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza with extra sauce. what i got: large pizza half pepperoni and half ham & pineapple with ""easy"" sauce?? this place is a joke. drive to a different one - it's worth the gas."
171,1,Negative,"stay away.  i'm a woman that just experience verbal assault by a sexist manager.

this is the most disturbing experience i've ever had. they completely messed up our pizza order, took an hour to deliver it then an hour to come back and reimburse us then wanted the whole pizza back as if we should pay for their mistake by not eating.  when we told them we had already eaten some of it they wouldn't reimburse us.

when i talked to the manager about it he was rude.  he talked over me, when i said this was not very good customer service he said ""so what"".  

the managers name is rick and he's sexist misogynist and a very bad man.  

also the food is terrible."
172,2,Negative,"so we recently moved to brookline and this place is just up the road. having a great pizza shop within walking distance is a great thing, unfortunately it is not this place... after two orders of undercooked pizza we tried a final time tonight and specifically asked for the pizza ""well done"" hoping that way it would come out cooked correctly. sadly this was the most undercooked yet and since neither of us enjoy raw dough we won't be back.."
173,1,Negative,"ive eaten here twice now. both times were a great disappointment. first time i ordered pizza it was burnt so badly i couldnt eat it. 
the second time i ordered the meatballs and pasta. the sauce is so bland it makes store bought taste great ! 
please do yourself a huge favor and try one of the many other restaurants in town. you will thank me later."
174,2,Negative,"been going to nello's for years, but after last night, i'm taking some time off and spending my pizza $ elsewhere.  not crowded, table for 3 in the bar....2 entrees came out quickly while i waited for a woodfired pizza.  my wife's salad was missing the pancetta as advertised.  my pizza finally arrived but was made incorrectly...i was told no problem, we'll make another one....waited, waited and bingo another wrong pizza - this time it wasn't even close. after 2 hours i asked for the check and i'm gone.  nello's get it together please and do something about your pizza dough - it's like cardboard lately.  headed to florencia for a while....and so is my $."
175,2,Negative,what to say about this place didn't really get a try the pizza too much after waiting 40 minutes for the food they made it wrong the couple bites that i had i was not impressed at all italian beef that's horrible i think i could have got better sandwich at arby's the greek salad was very small mediocre dressing had no flavor the tomato soup tastes like something out of a can overall very disappointed only thing it made it worthwhile was the manager comp in the mail and sending us home with a spinach pizza tried that one was not very good but thanks to the manager i will give it another chance maybe in a few months after they've been open for a while
176,1,Negative,this is a pizza 73 place with a different name same crap pizza and same horrible wings just like 73 only you pay more money for the pizza here then at 73 and it's the exact same product plus it took them one and half hours to deliver it to my  place 10mins away on a wednesday night i'm  being generous with the 1 star rating
177,2,Negative,i've been here twice now. the first time i wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke. i ended up only ordering a shake. i went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running). i was not impressed. i'm not sure what was weird about. the sauce? the cheese? i've had way better pizzas. loved the milkshake. i give it two stars because my husband likes it and i have to tolerate it for him.
178,1,Negative,"i feel bad giving this place such a bad review based on my experience a couple of months ago, and never usually dislike places this much, but here i am.  i am a resident of the bloor/kingsway area in which this restaurant is situated.  now if you know the strip of bloor where this restaurant is, you know that every second place is a restaurant, and they are all pretty busy.  with the selection of restaurants in this area and other italian restaurants in etobicoke (just go to la veranda around the corner!!) i don't know how this place stays open based on my experience.  there is just so much better italian in etobicoke to be had.

anyways, i have been here twice.  the first time was something like 2 or 3 years ago with a friend for a casual dinner and i think i may have had a salad or something.  i don't really remember my experience, i just remember i wasn't unhappy with it and generally enjoyed the experience and decor of the restaurant. but this review isn't based on that.

so a couple of months ago my boyfriend and i were craving italian and wanted to go somewhere close by.  i wanted to go somewhere new and my boyfriend hadn't been there before.  being a creature of habit, he wanted to go to la veranda around the corner which is an etobicoke failsafe of ours but i insisted on coming to sempre.

my boyfriend went to culinary school and is a sous chef at a very busy italian restaurant in toronto and he really found the menu to be lacking.  he wasn't super hungry and ordered a pizza.  i ordered a pasta (don't remember what it originally was now) which took a super long time to come (even though it wasn't very busy), and when it finally came out i noticed that it really did not seem to match the description of the pasta that i had ordered.  i recall that when giving my order to the waitress she seemed slightly confused with what i had asked for even though what i had ordered was right there on the menu, and i didn't ask for it with any changes or anything.  i recall the pasta i originally had ordered was supposed to have a white sauce and the one i received had a rose sauce, as well as being tortellini.  i was honestly so hungry at that point and not one to complain anyways that i just decided to eat it.  well, if what i had received had turned out to be good i wouldn't have been too unhappy but i honestly would equate the pasta and sauce to some crappy wedding banquet hall food.  the tortellini had no flavour and tasted like something i could have boiled at home from a package from costco.  the pasta was definately not made in house.  the sauce was probably the worst part and made me dislike it so much.  it was just too thick, had no flavour, and just so reminescent of crappy banquet hall food and generally unpleasant.  the pizza was not up to par of what you would expect to find from an italian resto in toronto, had not much sauce and the crust wasn't great.  

there are tons of options along the bloor strip, if you really want italian skip this and go to la veranda around the corner."
179,1,Negative,"something has changed for the worse here.  we are long time regulars and i have to agree with erica v that on the last two pizzas the crust has been soggy / gummy and the sauce was runny / watery even when ordered well done and crispy.  so much so i called the manager last night. this used to be good pizza but sadly no longer. they've either changed ingredients, recipes and/or chefs.  last week's sausage pizza tasted like bagged hospital grade meat."
180,1,Negative,"i always get good pizza from here. 

tonight i called in my order and drove down to wait for it. as i was sitting waiting in front of the big glass window,  a driver pulls up, walks in and when the other guys went to the back he grabbed some chicken pieces and shoved it in his mouth. then he proceeded to stick every one of his fingers into his mouth up to his knuckles. i'm not exaggerating. then he wipes his mouth with the same hand. then his nose, then he did his fingers again. then his nose again. and his fingers one last time. 

 i thought he would at least wash his hands, but then he grabbed someones wings then he took a pizza did something with it then put the order out for pick up. i walked in real quick and asked the guy who just walked up to the counter if that order is mine, he said no i said good because if that is mine i don't want it. i told him what happened and he told the guy to wash his hands..... i feel bad for the people who had this guy deliver their food tonight around 6:15pm. yuck"
181,2,Negative,"hit or miss. the first time i went the food was amazing so much so i i went back for a second time in a week. the first time i got a 'build your own pizza' with alfredo sauce and chicken. the second time i ordered the same thing and they forgot the alfredo but put it on the side, okay fine it was still good. today, i ordered food to pick up and ordered the same pizza for a third time. i was told they didn't have alfredo sauce for pizza only white garlic or red sauce (even after having it twice!)  i asked if they could put the alfredo on the side like the did before, the woman taking my order said they could ( i don't understand why it can be put on the side and not the pizza.) i picked up the food and brought it home and the ""alfredo"" was literally warm milk with salt at the bottom literally! needless to say, i'm beyond angry. the quality has gone down consistently since my first visit, i won't be returning."
182,2,Negative,"i lost a little faith in this city by how celebrated this place is. serviceable at best. cheese blend is highly questionable, mine was rubbery really. crust was ok. if you think this is the ultimate then i question your dedication to pizza consumption.

ps: the spot is cash only, which is also annoying."
183,1,Negative,"do not!!!!! order through romano's pizzeria. horrific customer service. i was told that i would not be refunded my $20 order...  for my extremely cold pizza that they said was fresh out the oven. the pizza felt like it had been sitting out for a few hours ... that's absolutely disgusting.... the manager refused to refund me $20... 
i waited in my car with my 2 month old new born for almost an hour!!!! to get an extremely cold disgusting pizza. again what horrific customer service. we had to buy an alboa pizza to sastify our  pizza craving...  i would highly recommend not ordering through this disgusting horrific cold gross pizza place. they don't care about what they serve you. & again the customer service was absolutely terrible!!!!! my pooor new born child having to wait in the car for over an hour because they didn't have their times right. for a disgusting cold pizza that not even my dog would eat. if you want awful gross pizza then this is your place ... other then that spend your money elsewhere. would never recommend this place to anyone!!!!! in this lifetime."
184,1,Negative,"i came in to the restaurant at 4:30pm. it was mostly empty, however the service was slow and inattentive. 

i ordered the clam pizza and am sorry i did. the only clams on the pizza were 1-2 still in the shell on each slice. you had to scrape them out yourself. i would rather eat my pizza rather than work for it. furthermore, this resulted in very little crab meat on the pizza. lastly, there were clam shells broken off and melted into the pizza. they were hard to see. thus, there were 2-3 bites i literally has to spit out as i was chewing clam shells. 

when i pointed this out to the waitress amanda she said sorry and she would tell the chef. she even admitted that this was not the first time this has happened. despite my complaint there was not an offer to deduct a portion of the bill or offer of free dessert or something to compensate. 

disappointing."
185,1,Negative,"just got delivery from here and wtf... ordered the half sheet pizza and at some point it was evidently sideways from there to here. we got 2 toppings on one side, 2 on the other and when we opened it, about 1/4 of the pizza was ""mine"" as the other ingredients had slid over. this in itself might not be a problem - i could maybe give it an ""eh, whatever,"" but then in taking 2 bites, i knew that for how greasy the pizza was, if i ate it my digestive system would be in for a cleansing if you know what i mean. 

i called them back and said i wanted my credit card refunded. she had to call the owner. the driver promptly came back with a ""transaction voided"" receipt and i was told that the amount would be credited to my account within 2-3 business days. oh, and incidentally, they even asked us to return the 2 liter of soda - so we had to pour it back into the bottle from our glasses. i should have said i was keeping it for the inconvenience, but you know, whatever. 

needless to say i will not be ordering from nunzio's again."
186,2,Negative,kinda disappointing. it was a late night pick and kinda wanted to send it back. the veggies and meats on pizza was delicious but the crust seem pre-made and the cheese and sauce had no flavor.
187,1,Negative,this is pretty bad pizza. we ordered because it could be delivered to hotel  ...tastes like cardboard very light on toppings...i would never order again. i think it might be frozen digorno. the salads were lettuce w three tomato slices..some of lettuce was turning.
188,2,Negative,"this review is based my latest experience. i have always ordered from magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. i ordered hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. now magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  i used the eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. the food arrived 15 minutes later.  so it took 10 minutes to cook the food. doesn't pizza take longer to cook? the bell peppers were missing from the pizza. it must  have been pre-made. the fingers were greasy and tasted weird. i should have taken a picture. the fries were good. had to throw the fingers out. won't be ordering from there for a while."
189,1,Negative,"ordered and picked up two pizza's tonight, asked for extra sauce on them. no extra sauce on either and didn't get much cheese on one of them that was suppose to be half cheese half sausage. called and spoke to saba the manager and he said it was my fault for ordering extra sauce, ""the cheese sucked up the sauce"". what?! refused to replace. never had this problem before. not worth $45 i spent for two pizza's."
190,1,Negative,"so yeah, i'm reviewing a chain. i wanted to try the ""new and improved"" domino's pizza. everything those commercials said about their old pizza was true-- cardboard crust, ketchup sauce, bad toppings. so, is the new domino's better than the old? 

yes, but that's not saying much-- it moves up from negative stars to 1, perhaps1.5 stars. the cheese and toppings are much improved. the cheese abundant and tasty and the mushrooms were thickly sliced whole brown mushrooms. really good. the sauce was a bit salty and bland-- not horrible, but nothing to write home about. 

they still have a problem with the crust. the crust on both mediums we ordered was mushy and underdone. while it wasn't as blatantly offensive as old domino's crust, it still had a lingering aftertaste like those bisquick pancakes mom used to try to feed us in the 1970s. add to that an abundant dusting of garlic salt and you've got a taste reminiscent of your first boyfriend's attempt to make you an ""italian"" dinner with garlic bread. i had no idea they even made garlic salt any more. it hasn't improved. 

so, the pizza has improved, but not enough for me to ever eat it again."
191,1,Negative,i normally order pizza from this location on a regular basis. i would carry out but this was my 1st time having it delivered...i completed my order at 7:00 it was confirmed on the delivery tracking that the order would be delivered at 7:37 well i did not get my order until 8:15. almost 40 mins after the tracker staled that i would have my food. the pizza was cold and my wings were under cooked. i called the establishment and was told i could get a free pizza :( the manager stated that she would used this as a coaching opportunity for her drivers. honestly that is not my issue. it will be a while before i return here.
192,1,Negative,seriously the worst service i have ever got in my life . we called in to order a pizza and the kid on the phone couldn't even figure out how to take my order then i told them 3 different times we had cash and to please bring change for it . you think they brought change ? nope they tried to give us change back as if we were tipping the kid 20$ for the delivery . 3 timesssss i told them .  horrible cold pizza too i will never eat with pizza hut ever again . ever!!!
193,1,Negative,"went in for lunch, looked good so i ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, and some garlic parmesan fries. they burned the pizza and under cooked the fries. but to top it off, the order came to $10.27(pricy but whatever its vegas), and i gave them a dollar tip (wrote on the reciet and even totaled it out for them). when i went to check my bank account, they charged me $12.32... i hate to be anal about one dollar, but they did not deserve it and it was blindly taken from me, from right under my nose. the woman cashier was nice but the gentleman cook seemed like an asshole and gave me a sassy look when i asked for a side of ranch. no mention of the ranch costing extra or anything.. i would of paid for it.. assuming it cost a dollar.. i guess i did pay for it. whatever, last time i visit them."
194,1,Negative,one star because i can't tell you if the pizza is any good because every time i call they put me on hold.  first time 10min so figured they forgot i was on hold. so hung up &  called back when they asked if they could put me on hold i said no &  they put me on hold anyway.
195,2,Negative,"if you think this is good pizza, you need to get out more. i tried two kinds: the bronze dragon and the breakfast pizza. i honestly couldn't tell you which was supposed to be which. maybe it was because the line was long, but the crust was underdone and too doughy, and the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink. i'm not from the midwest and i have yet to find pizza that even comes close to what i'm used to in pa/nj/ny."
196,1,Negative,"ok, so i've been ordering from this location for months now and each time the delivery service is getting worse. im at the point that i will not order from then anymore and will not tell anyone of my family or friends to order from them ever after today. i ordered their $25 coupon of 2 large 2 topping pizzas and 20 wings today. i placed this order at 12:35 pm and as told it would take an hour for delivery(which seemed a bit excessive at this time of day. since it was after lunch rush). so as the hour mark came and then went the order was still not here. at 20 minutes after the hour it was still not here, so i called them to ask where my order was since its now been an hour and 20 minutes. the girl on the phone proceeds to go on to tell me that the order was out for delivery and quickly got off the phone. so again i sat outside waiting and again another 10 minutes went by and no order. i called back again and this time the girl put me on hold to see where the delivery girl was at. she came back on the line and tried to tell me that there was traffic that delayed the driver and that she was less then 5 minutes away. now that began to irritate me since they are only 3 miles from where i live. there's not that much traffic that would delay a delivery by 30 minutes. the girl just kept saying she was sorry and never offered up any comps of any kind to show any customer appreciation to keep me as a customer. i then asked her what they were going to do to compensate me for not having my food by an hour and a half. she then says oh well i can give you a $10 credit on your account for your next order. i said fine and hung up expecting my order in under 5 minutes as they claimed. well that was a lie yet again as it took the driver an additional 12 minutes to finally show up. so now its been an hour and 42 minutes; the driver got out and acted like nothing was wrong. she asked ""hi how's your day going?"" i responded with ""it would have been better if my order was here over 40 minutes ago, on time."" she then got very snotty quick and snapped ""well there's only one of me and your total is $30.58."" i said ""well i would like to check to see if my food was still hot before i pay for it."" she pulled out one pizza and handed it to me and i checked it. granted it wasnt as hot as all my other orders from before but it was warm enough that i went ahead and paid for it. i then handed the driver $40 and she said ""let me get your change."" the change should have been $9.42 she came back and handed me only $9 not even saying sorry i don't have any change, change she just assumed she could keep the 42 cents and hesitated like i was going to give her more for a tip.  well now i'm seeing red so that's all she got as her tip was the 42 cents she assumed she could just keep and i walked away from her. this whole delivery was the worse experience i have ever had from this place. they acted as though my order didn't matter in any way. they acted like they were irritated with me for being upset for not having my food for over and hour and 40 minutes. it will be awhile before i order from them again if i do decide to."
197,1,Negative,"i ordered sophia pizza and i was expecting a delicious food with proper spice. what i ended up eating was testing horrible , super spicy which burned my mouth. i couldn't even have the second slice. the funny thing is we checked the menu to see if there was any indication of the spiciness of the food! no! nothing . i'm assuming they just dropped the bottle of pepper in the pizza hoping no one will notice."
198,1,Negative,"bad service and never enough cheese pizza, this place used to be good but it's gone downhill."
199,2,Negative,"i've ordered late night delivery for pizza, pasta ans wings as an experiment. everything sucked. i will never order from them again."
200,1,Negative,"i ordered there brooklyn style philly cheese steak pizza. i asked for them to put the  garlic crust but i guess the forgot. when i opened up my pizza box i was extremely disappointed  there was little to no meat on the pizza litterly only about two slices had meat on a large pizzs... wtf i did order a philly cheese stake.  know $23 latter and still dissatisfied.
with so many other pizza options around idk if i will be back."
201,2,Negative,"if you love lou malnatis like i do, you will be very disappointed by this pizza. we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. the pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to lou's!"
202,1,Negative,"just dined here this evening. i have to say this place had hands down the worst service i have ever received. party of 3 adults, the server suggested we order 3 pizzas and an appetizer. we were not interested in their limited appetizer menu so we decided to skip it and ordered the pizzas. it took 45 minutes to get the food, i know they bake it fresh so i was willing to wait but the pizzas were bland and overpriced. and we had 1 and 3/4 pizza left, her suggestion of 3 pizzas was far too much food. honestly, i would skip this one."
203,2,Negative,"we had heard some good things about this place....so we were excited.  however, it's sub-par at best.  service was slow and rude....a rarity in this part of wisconsin, and the pizza was edible but i don't understand why people think it's that good.  we won't be back."
204,2,Negative,"i have been to custom built 3 times now the first time was before my yelp days and i boosted all over facebook about it. i let all my friends and family know how awesome of a place it was as well as how awesome the customer service was. i think things have changed since then. 

allow me to elaborate, the second time i went to custom built i quickly left the restaurant and choose not to dine there because i was turned off by this one employee today i went back and have found that the employees name is larry. the time i walked out was because larry was on the phone in the back and came out front to greet us. when he came out he was holding his cell phone in his hand and asked to wait a second as he finished his call, we didn't see this as a problem so we patiently waited. when larry returned he had his cell phone in his hand and was hanging it up he placed the phone on a back counter came to the front and asked what type of dough we would like to choose. he quickly grabbed a regular ball of dough and was about to start kneeding it when i stopped him and apologized to him and told him loud and clear that i could not dine at his establishment since i did not see him wash his hands and we walked out. bummed out by the incident i still did not want to simply stray away because of one employee so i told my wife we would give it some time and try again.

well we did and we re-tried today. like i said previously today the same employee that i walked out on was there and he was at the door. i take it that he did not remember the incident as he did not even recognize me. i thought that was great so that i could try and get a new experience and try and forget about the previous incident. i have to say the evening staff that first introduced my wife and i to custom built was exceptional they were up beat and seemed excited to just make a pizza. today it felt like it was monday and things were just crawling. if it was not for that one awesome employee that was genuinely happy to be at work i would have walked out once again that employee's name is moe and the first thing that he did when he saw us and asked us the dough we wanted was go to the sink and wash his hands!! i quickly pointed it out to my wife and said look at that exceptional employee that is washing his hand prior to preparing our food. moe quickly keeded out the dough and placed it on the order line to get prepared. excited by a happy employee this made me happy and i quickly remembered the first time i went to custom built. i said to the gentlemen that was preparing my pizza the first time i came here the young man that assisted me suggested to try and get creative instead of having the same mundane pizza. he suggested trying multiple sauces and i remember him saying you can split this pizza into 16th's to try and give us a challenge we love challenges. when i mentioned this to the guy that was helping me today he seemed a little put off by the whole thing and even said i don't know why he would suggest trying so many different things. i ordered the pizza in 3rds so that i could try the different sauces 1 pesto 1 alfredo and 1 spicy. the guy seemed very uncertain on how to spread the sauces in thirds so he just made circles that ended up bleeding into each other in the cooking process. i layered and layered my pizza with topping after topping after topping. i always have fun in that part i feel like i'm a kid again when i get to pick and choose. 

my wife placed he order and i went to pay. when i was paying larry was at the cash register and i told him that i forgot my belly card but had received the message that all custom built pizzas were 6.95 for the month of april. he said ok and then i showed him my yelp 10% off for checking in for the first time he again shook his head to which i thought was a clear sign for him acknowledging it. i paid the tab and was just handed my change. i thought that was a bit odd so i asked if i could have my receipt. larry printed a receipt and gave it to me, i say a receipt because i was unsure if it was actually mine i paid with a $100.00 bill and did not nee that on the receipt and i also did not see a discount. i didn't want to be rude and be like yo! where my discount son!! so i just kept quite and said to myself the food will clearly change my mind and it will be worth every penny.

well i got my pizza and it was totally not what i expected the sauces had all bleed into each other and i could not tell the difference from what was pesto what was spicy and where the alfredo started and ended. also today i watched as larry was at the cash register and then went to make a pizza for a guest with out washing his hands again!!!! some one needs to go over safe food handling with larry before he gets someone sick!! 

i don't know if i can try custom built again and i was a fan :(!"
205,1,Negative,"my last visit

placed a ""to go"" order 3 small pizzas, 2 with pepperoni and 1 with pepperoni and sausage, all with asiago flavored crust. i walked in to hungry howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty.  however, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge i was there and  to get my order. 

the pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas i have ever had from hungry howies and the order wasn't even correct. i wish i would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store.  i called hungry howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn't correct.  the associate who answered the phone response was ""sorry bout that, not sure who cooked it.  i guess we can cook another"".  after waiting another 20 minutes to cook another pizza i head back up to hungry howies and yes, once again my order wasn't correct (wrong flavor crust). since i wasn't willing to wait another 20 minutes i took the pizza and headed home.

my previous experiences with hungry howies has always been hit or miss. i think i will drive a little further to one of the many other pizza places in my area."
206,1,Negative,"o stars an option? 

used to come here years ago as a young child, raced all kinds of laps weekly (first opened). over the years this place has gone down hill! the owner and his son are douchers, cocky, and selfish. they don't care about their employees just their customers that are giving the creedy individuals money on some sort. this place is way too over priced for some childish electric carts, buy some (real) gas go-karts.. and take one for a real race. the employees are unprofessional, they stand around the counters on their phones, and don't pay attention to the race track for a second set of eyes. 

they don't wear gloves cooking pizzas

you're better off going to fast lap or somewhere else with gas go-karts, and more reasonable prices!"
207,1,Negative,"as a native chicagoan i grew up going to giordano's  as well as the other top chicago style pizza joints.  i know good chicago pizza - this is not it!  the pizza was undercooked and frankly gross.  my husband, myself and my daughter could not eat it.  we even thew out our leftovers the moment we got home.  they are doing chicago style pizza a disservice.  the chopped salad was delicious.  the mozzarella triangles were great.  the wait for a table was minimal.  the wait for the pizza was 45 mins as expected.  the restaurant was nice.  the staff was nice.  the high chair was even clean (harder to find then you think).  but if a pizza place can't put out amazing pizza, nothing else matters."
208,1,Negative,"a couple weeks ago, my friends and i arrived in phoenix, starving, at about 1am with a 12 hour layover. we shuttled to a motel and discovered our only options were jack in the box drive-thru (no car) and gus's. i'm not going to credit this place with an elaborate review. i didn't know pizza could taste this bad. i mean how do u mess up a pizza. i am not a food critic and i am not picky by any means. my friend could only stomach two slices and he can eat! the pizza was flavorless, tasted like water just like one other reviewer mentioned and upon swallowing, the cardboard box seemed the more edible of the two. i'm not even kidding. 
i must also mention the price. i know beggars can't be choosers. i don't mind paying out the ear for a edible meal when it's a last resort. 
we paid $50. and change including $5 tip for the ""two gnarly pizzas and disgusting chicken wings special"".   
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee."
209,2,Negative,"pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. they don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  i don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered."
210,1,Negative,last night my family at cicis  pizza.  we hadn't eaten in this restaurant for about a year and boy have they changed.  the restaurant is under staffed.  we went up to the counter quite a few times and there were not any pizza's.  it's hard to believe you go to a pizza buffet and no pizza.  we waited 20 minutes for a desert pizza to be made.  there were a few people working really hard but they needed more people.  the floor had old napkin and it took quite a few minutes for the 1 person to take our used plates away.  we will never go back.
211,2,Negative,"pizzas are salty. all the time every time. i don't know why 
my kids think it's gonna be better next time. no matter what kinda of pizza it's going to be salty. they also use cheddar cheese on most pizzas.  the salads are good and we have had the pablo picasso a couple of times.  the dirty monkey drink i ordered was mostly ice so the next one i ordered i asked if i could have ""light ice"" and when she brought me this the glass was just over half full to ""compensate"" for the ""light ice"".  this was odd in my opinion. the first dirty monkey i had was so full of ice that it was all that hit my lip as i drank it."
212,1,Negative,"thought i'd give them one more chance, tonight still zero hot and ready pizzas and now the customers are stealing sauces when the cashier leaves the counter, which is more often than she's there."
213,1,Negative,"doughy pizza with a bad sauce. 

plus i ordered mozarella sticks and they did not deliver them, charged me for them, and refused a refund. 

do not support this business."
214,2,Negative,"i'm giving them one star because they produce pizza that is among the best in the city and another star because they've proven that corsa italia can support a dinning scene that is kicked up a notch.  
the prices are a little high for what they offer and the service could be given some pointers and from what i've seen and read on other sites from past employees, the proprietors and management can use an attitude adjustment.  a server belittled the busboy in front of us once when the busboy brought to me a glass of wine that was only half full.  another time our white wine was room temperature.  we brought it up with our server who reminded me of yosemite sam and wouldn't have looked out of place at a tea party rally informed me that white wine is served at a higher temperature than beer.  yes, thank you tips, now can you please replace my 22 degree wine.  while he did correct the situation in the end, we received the cold shoulder the rest of the evening.  when it came time to paying our bill there was a drink missing from it, we informed him and while we didn't expect him to kiss our feet, didn't receive much more than a, ""uh, ya, thanks."" then printed us a new bill.  
there are many new pizzerias that have opened up with great service and while i appreciate their contribution in terms of atmosphere and food, snooty ""qsa"" isn't what st. clair west needs."
215,2,Negative,the pizza is ok nothing to brag about and the service sucks had to go to the counter to get my drinks refilled and they looked at me like i had three heads.
216,1,Negative,"this place has great pizza but my experience with this location has been awful. they either take over an hour to get you a pizza or they don't deliver it at all. the first time i tried to order a pizza from here they ended up being closed because of a management issue and i never got my pizza (i never got charged) but i also had to wait an hour and a half before realizing it was never coming.

the second time i ordered we had to call about delivery and they had the address written down as camelflower instead of camelback. took about 90 mins. 

the third time i tried to order a pizza it took 90 mins before it was delivered and that was only after i called to check in on it. they gave me a free pizza credited to my account as a result. 

now, i'm sitting here waiting for yet another pizza that was quoted as being delivered in 45 mins.. it has been 90 minutes, again. we called to check in on the pizza (see a trend?) and they said they only had one driver. now, i'm wondering if my pizza is going to be cold. 

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (i could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). if you're wondering why domino's or pizza hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the art of pizza delivery. either figure your system out, or give it up. 

if you're wondering if you should try this place then you should drive to the location and enjoy the food. don't wait for your pizza to be delivered. you might starve."
217,1,Negative,"golly, i would tell people not to go here. i simply ask for four pizzas, two with pepperoni, one with olives, and one with pineapple. they gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. i can't eat meat. i was with another person, who didn't mind the other topping on his pepperoni. i went back to let them know they made a mistake. i was charged for two more pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. i saw someone tell the cook, how the pizzas should be made. once i got my two pizzas, they had pepperoni with olives and pepperoni with pineapples. again! i was on lunch, there was no point for asking to fix this problem again because i had to go back to work. brought it up to them, ask them if i could just get my money back since i can't eat the pizzas they made me. i was told i could not get my money back only credit. i don't want credit because that was my lunch money to eat. i was told by the employees,""mistakes happen."" after i ask for my money back. which i understand mistakes do happen, i work in customers service too. but when i see an employee tell the cook how the pizzas should be made, one with only olives and one with only pineapple, and both pizzas still end up having pepperoni on it. that's not just a mistake. which i still have the receipt that's says cheese pizzas with olives and pineapple."
218,1,Negative,"do not eat here!!! i purchased a groupon deal for family meal: large cheese pizza, 20 wings, 2 l soda. worst pizza ever!!we ordered over the phone and picked up the order.it was so greasy, the oil soaked through the box onto my car seat. the flavor is so-so-similar to frozen. the cheese was low quality, the crust was blahh, and the worst part: the sauce was thinly spread.the wings were hard, dry, and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.the soda was the only thing our family can use. we also ordered manicotti,some beach title pizza, and garlic knots. manicotti was okay. beach pizza was same as cheese pizza with only meager toppings thinly spread out. the garlic knots were hard enough to toss like a rock.we had to order from papa john's.it is so true: if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is.."
219,2,Negative,"i think i expected more from this place because its supposed to be ""new york"" pizza and the decor of the restaurant is decorated very new york-ish.  but i guess it is new york style, thin crust, sliced pizzas ready in the display window... but as for the taste, yeah not so much.  

the couple times i ordered pizza from there, the crust was semi burned with black burn spots on the crust and on the bottom.  the cannolis were just ok and smaller than others i've had.  

maybe i'm just comparing it too much to the ""real thing"" and being biased.  word of advice:  less than a mile down the road is rocco's ny pizza... definitely go there instead!!!"
220,1,Negative,"no place settings - had to steal from empty table.  dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? frozen pizza kinda quality. salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce."
221,1,Negative,"bad experienced everrrr!!! never in my life have complained to any businesses but this domino's pizza have the bad service and take forever to have the order ready! took me about  1 hour and 45 minutes (or more) to have my order ready! and gave me attitude!!! what kind of service is thissss????? would never come back here again! ever. 

it deserve 0 star but no choice! anyhowwww, the foods are fine though. if you ever consider ordering pizza from this place. just call in and come pick up in 2 hours! many people were complaining and cancelled orders!!"
222,1,Negative,"im usually not this kind of guy but sometimes a business deserves to be publicly slammed for a solid pattern incompetence...there isn't a -4 rating??? so i ordered 5 deep dish pizzas, 2 cheese and 3 pepperoni... pretty simple right? hard to really screw that up i would think? 
i don't know how hard it is to actually take an order and see it through because i've never worked there but i think it would be easy with computers n stuff, or a pen and paper idk maybe it is a hard job..? 
anyway i had someone go pick the order up, he didn't know exactly what i ordered but when he came back i ended up with 4 pepperoni pizzas and 1 cheese... 

****this has been five times in a row they have completely givin me a different order i hope the world sees this and avoids the place, drive down the road a bit further and go to another ceasars, trust me it's worth the gas****
so that's that, ya lost a customer obviously ya don't care because the last two times i got the wrong order i brought it to their attention but yet you all still manage to keep a strong track record of screwing up the most important part, the order!"
223,1,Negative,"i just tried to order a pizza for delivery and got a phone call from the general manager saying that they don't deliver to where i live in deforest.  except they delivered to my house within the last two weeks!  the manager argued with me saying they never have and told me they don't have record of any orders from my phone number, which i updated when i last ordered online and on their delivery map my address is included.  he basically called me a liar to my face, even though the pizza box from their last delivery to my house is still in the garage waiting to go out with the recycling.  if you changed your coverage area fine, but don't be a jerk to a customer and call them a liar.  i have a medical degree and am not some confused idiot.  then i got an email saying that my order was being made.  the manager said that they don't deal with online stuff in their store.  someone needs to get on the same page and be consistent.  worst customer service i've experienced in years!  i will never order from this franchise nor any other in the area and will be sure to pass along to my friends how they treat customers.  i was so excited to find out they delivered here only to be disappointed.  it's a shame too, because their gluten free pizza was pretty good.  save yourself the grief and go to salvatore's tomato pie's instead.  way better pizza and way nicer people!!!"
224,1,Negative,"customer service from the order taker and driver were decent, but this place serves really, really terrible food. i should have known, but i was drawn by what i thought was an awesome coupon deal. you know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? that's not the case here. it reeked of onions.

the pizza was undercooked and bare. i had the supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. also, i never thought anyone could screw up buffalo wings. it's just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn't even do that. the wings looked unsauced and when i asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. after a closer inspection i understood, and it was right then and there that i realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. the wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. that was most likely the case. i tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future.

i am hoping i can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. i wish i could get a refund, but i don't want to put up a fight just to hear that they won't provide one. potential customers, please do yourself a favor and stay clear; the only valuable thing you'd be ordering here is a life lesson."
