The pizza was gross. we ordered mozarella sticks and they gave us three slices of pizza. we were told we could get a lighter pizza. we were told our pizza was fake. we were told our pizza was from Asia. they even asked us to return it. we told them $5 off. no mention of the pizza being fake. i would have thought they would have put the mention of ""lightweight pizza"" on the menu. not only did the pizza not come through, it was frosting missing. we ended up just scrapping by taking the pizza home. it was not a great experience. the service was decent, but the food taste like it came from a food processor. something to think about."

The pizza was gross. i'm not a food critic and i'm not picky by any means, but when i see an entree that is 50/50 split between cpk and domino's, pizza and fries, and there is a 1/4 pizza thrown between them, that is just not right. the pizza at cpk is much better than the one at domino's, just ask us. the fries are good though."

The pizza was gross! it was unimaginably so. the toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  papa johns offered to take some of the price off, which was fine.  i didn't mind that one bit. the bacon crust was delicious though. i'd rather eat my pizza now than go back to that bacon crust.  the price went up, not down.  

they still have a problem with the crust.  the crust on both mediums we ordered was mushy and underdone. while it wasn't as blatantly offensive as old domino's crust, it still had a lingering aftertaste like those bisquick pancakes mom used to try to feed us in the 1970s. add to

"bottom feeder, nothing but bad news for those that enjoy pizza here.  the pizza here is over priced, and pretty shitty quality.  the pizza here is most likely from chicago, as well.   the pizza here is just a drag.   it's hard to believe you're sitting in a restaurant and everyone around you is eating pizza.  it's so much nicer in the flesh.   the service sucks.  they don't have the guts to do anything about the pizza.  they're just bailing.

The pizza was gross. yes it was fresh and it had no odor. however, it did not taste right. i don't usually dislike pizza this much, let alone this much a pizza with no flavor. the pizza should have read as pork belly pizza. that would have been a no brainer. obviously they ran out of the pork belly, didn't they? nope they went with the standard bacon crust.

The pizza was gross. we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted this pizza for christmas. the pizza sauce was so mild it could not even hold together without the garlic crust. the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up the food it was literally two minutes after the hour. not two minutes, but rather forty five minutes. we ate it. it was good. but we will never go back.

The pizza was gross. it almost taste like mold. the crust was bland, hard as a rock like cardboard and just... bland. the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still warm when I took it back to the sink. so i'm guessing the pizza was at least partially submerged in the tan bath water. maybe it was just too hot, i don't know. but either way - the experience was one of minus ten. i will never go back. $69 plus tip for a cold pizza. there were clam shells and pretzels in the pizza. no crab cakes. and no green salad.

The pizza was gross! i'm not a food critic, so i can't vouch for the actual taste of the food, but judging by the reviews, i'd say the pizza is probably the worst part. so much so i called the manager last night. this used to be good pizza, but sadly no longer. they've either changed ingredients, recipes, and/or chefs. for some places, changing chefs are just a formality. not for cpk. ewwwwwwww. so gross. the pizza was also salty and just not very good. my daughter ordered a steak instead of a salad, and it was still a wet mess. $31.50 for a six-slize pizza and a drink with a bunch of weird toppings.

when we left the premises, the manager asked why i didn't tell her the bad news earlier. i said maybe because i was too embarrassed to tell her the bad news. she then says oh well i can tell you that everything was right with the family as long as you keep a low profile. i said fine and hung up expecting my order in under 5 minutes. alas, my pizza was never delivered.

The pizza was gross. we could tell when we opened the box.  the pizza was dark brown, as was the crust.  the brown sauce was also saltier than the normal.  while the crust was fine, the brown sauce was the only thing holding it together.  it was really nothing but salt.  the brown sauce tasted like it had been sitting in the sun for hours.  i don't know.  but either way, the crust tasted like a crappy wedding banquet hall.  it was the first time i've found a pizza that i didn't like.  and the place was clean.  nothing to write home about. 

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold this winter, come here.

The pizza was gross. it was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. plus, why would you even put bacon on a pizza? isn't that a violation of some sort? i'm not a food critic and i don't really have a thing for bacon... maybe it's because i'm a meat eater, but the crust is just not very good. the toppings are decent but the bacon crust is just not very good.

The pizza was gross. yes i agree sending it back isnt just wrong, it was also extremely unprofessional. they did not even bother to call me after about an hour. ended up just giving me a prepaid $10 off which i accepted. so basically they charged me $10 plus a $2 tip for a very poor product. this in itself might not be a problem - i could just use a little more cheese - but the customer service skillset needed to even consider sending me the food in the first place. really? asked for a refund? i don't think so.

plus, the service sucks.  i once had a kids meal and they were fairly full.  we waited an hour and 20 minutes for a child's dinner!  they must think we are idiots for wanting a child's dinner when there is a 20

The pizza was gross. i could have got a fraction of the pizza at home and still not have gotten the same result. the sauce - homemade i was told - was inspired by a pizza called ""charity bread"" i believe. i have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. nothing has ever been that disappointing that i felt the need to write one until now."

The pizza was gross. we are one of three people who have ordered from this location in the past few months. we ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, potatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my husband ordered a pizza with bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach ragard, and onions. today we discovered that our pizza was ruined because it was mistakenly believed to be turkey. yes, that is quite possibly the most bizarre mistake an employee could possibly make. we have ordered from this location before and were charged .30c for a small pizza. we were told no such thing as vegetarian pizza. we asked for a medium pizza and a side of ranch. the bartender honestly had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. we ended up just closing

The pizza was gross. we ordered mozzarella sticks and they gave us three slices of pepperoni pizza. we were charged .60c for each pizza. yes that's right, a nickel apiece. we were told it was just a mistake. we asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and we were told yes, it was just a mistake. we asked for our pizza to be frozen just in case. yes that was just a mistake. we got the wrong pizza. we have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. nothing has ever been that disappointing that i felt the need to write one until now."

The pizza was gross. we were charged .30c for a 2 liter. we paid cash & tipped well. the staff was apologetic.
"new italian restaurant. they make their own sauce & pasta ""everyday"" according to the waitress who served us. food was okay. garlic bread sold as ""charity bread"" was very tasty....apparently net proceeds are donated to some charity. 

because it is new....staff are inexperienced. they brought out a water bottle which they couldn't open...served us a pizza called ""americano"" instead of coffee americano (not sure why they thought we'd order 4 main dish for 3 people)...and when the coffee came, they forgot about cream which we had to ask for...

The pizza was gross. I don't know who put this together. i'm not a food critic and i'm not picky. maybe the baker didn't like the food, or the pizza was just poorly done. 

i'm hoping the food holds up. i've got to get a new place."
"food was ok, not the best just ok. service could have been better, we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and garlic knots. they brought out everything and forgot the wings! and never even told us anything about how long it would be, we finished the pizza and knots before the wings even came! we where told that they forgot to put them in! bs! and the manager never even came over to apologize.... horrible customer

The pizza was gross. we were quickly turned off by the experience.

do not eat here. do not waste your money and time here. go to a different local pizza place that you feel is worthy of your money and time."
"over priced and under delivers!
- a 12 inch pizza was likely only 10 inch.
- it barely fed my 3 hungry kids.
- tasted okay (definitely nothing to brag about)
- at $25, this was definitely not worth the price!
- would not recommend to my worst enemies."
"ordered 2 larges. one all dressed one plain. received pepperoni instead of plain with green sauce. when called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy, i was told

The pizza was gross. so we won't be returning."
"terrible, terrible, horrible. let me say first that we got the wrong pizza, i don't care who cooked it, it was not tasty. the second time i ordered we got a different customer service issue and they did not even apologize or offer a refund.  i do not fault them for what happened, it was a bad experience and they need to work on their customer service.  i would rather go to dominos. 

bottom line, if you want a sub par pizza delivered ice cold seconds please drive to the suburbs and go to a different place.

The pizza was gross. looked beautiful though. i have to say the pizza was terrible. it lacked the pazzaz quality that made so many other places tick. maybe it was the foggy that night, but the pizza tasted like wet cardboard. i don't know. but either way - it was not what i thought a pizza should taste like.

The pizza was gross. i'm not kidding. the cheese was blahh. they use cubano as a base sauce and topping so it must  have been horrible. the sauce was thick, bland and totally unappetizing. the crust was okay, but the cheese was fading quickly. i'm not even kidding. the cheese was just a bluish-gray that eventually turned into soup garnish after soup garnish after soup garnish (i could have made a stew out of this shit). the soup was also highly inconsistent. some days it was better than soup you'd get from a casserole, like the one i was the lucky owner of in nello's. other days it was just ok. maybe because it was late and the soup was

The pizza was gross. it was overcooked, the crust was dry, and the toppings were sparse. plus, where is the bacon?

the manager on duty failed to do his duties when i requested him to call security to come assist me when i was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. i felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager never called them. he in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. i spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call.

"pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. they don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  i don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered."

"this was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. 

we came in around 1:30 on a sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. my wife and i decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. as we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. she then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!?
^
The pizza was gross. tasted like molding/eggplant parmesan with whatever pesto sauce you choose. took about 90 mins for my pizza to be even come close to what i expected. i would pass on eating here. too bad. it was the slowest pizza i have ever had from this place. maybe because they are just opening up... or maybe because they are just getting a start. 

not sure. but either way - wait for a good pizza you will thank me later.

if you want a really bad pizza, you could just as easily get a pizza from there. just make sure you ask for the pizza from there first. i don't know."
"golly, i would tell people not to go here

The pizza was gross. i was shocked when i opened it. there was no trace of the cheese or sauce that made pizza so i was left with just salt and pepper. nothing hot or spicy. the crust was bland and hard. i needed more garlic.  i wasn't going to give up easily because there was a soup nearby with more garlic than i could eat. the soup was good though. the noodles were hard and chewy and needed more noodles than i had. the veggies were pretty good. the meatball was good.  the noodles were also very salty and not nearly enough to cover the soup's salty content.  

the final straw that broke the camel's back was when i handed the packet of noodles to the waitress. she looked

The pizza was gross. we can't eat it. the cornmeal topping was awful. we couldn't even have the second slice. our waiter probably spent two minutes the entire meal at my table. no tip. no understanding why my waiter would have spent two minutes each time he or she came in and out of my restaurant. we will never go back.

"this is one of the worst experiences i've had at a restaurants. we ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. after over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. he said he was too busy to help us. he said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. if we didn't want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. who treats customers like that? i told the server

The pizza was gross, i could have at least gotten a new pizza. the sauce - homemade i was told - was from a jar. not true. there was no jar. just too much sauce. my daughter got her salad dressed up as a stew and it was just all sauce. she did not get her salad dressed up. she got a salad and it was just salad. we did not get a salad. we were told salad was normal. we were told it was because it was a dressing. not true. the salad was not even close to what my daughter got. she got a shroom salad and it was just a big thick salad that we did not get out of the pot. we were told the sauce was from a jar. not true.

The pizza was gross.  it seemed macedonian (not cheese like in the picture) pizza.  it seemed to be knurled up very much like a ball of dough.  it was also very heavy.  we were not willing to give up our boys favorite pizza just to be corrected.  so we ordered a gluten free pizza.  the pizza was worth $10.00 - 12.00.  it was good.  but we will never go back.

The pizza was gross. so gross. i'm not going to credit this place with a meal.
they require a $7 order for a half dozen bread sticks. no pizza does that. they use store bought.  i have seen people work for $7.50 an hour plus. i have never worked for $9.50 an hour plus. i also have not seen pay for lunch. maybe it's because this is a profit driven place. 

they serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $4.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors). 

there's a jack in the box across the parking lot with hot food and friendly service."

The pizza was gross. so gross i couldnt even eat it. my sister ordered a pasta dish which took a pizza. so we decided to save the money and eat at a teddington's. everything those commercials said about their signature dish was true-- pasta was gross. so we all have to eat plain cheese pizza. the singaporeans have always been good at what they do, and they seem to have learned nothing from their past mistakes. 

because of this and other mistakes, teddington's should not be considered good pizza. rule number one for teddington's is 1 star. 

if you want 1 star pizza, drive to the black bull and eat here."

The pizza was gross. every time i ate it i would feel bad for being a pizza fan and every time i got the same reaction: more cheese, no taste. i should have known. first of all it was not a good pizza, secondly the crust was not nice and the sauce was runny and tasted like something from a jar. thirdly, there was a lot of garlic sauce which i did not like. fourthly, and most importantly, there was a lot of parmesan on top of the pizza. why did you choose to go parmesan over regular? and why did you choose to put the tomato sauce on top of the pizza rather than on the side? and finally, why did you stop at just one sauce and drop it in

The pizza was gross. We are positive there was a line but it was long and we weren't able to eat it all in one sitting like we could have. we eventually had to be put on hold to be followed up by a staff member. not only did we have to wait but we also had to wait an hour before getting our pizzas. we were not even offered our pizzas until we were told our pizzas were on the way. we were told it was a mistake and that we could get our pizzas later. terrible customer service. the pizzas were cold and our waiter probably spent two minutes total the night before cleaning our plates. they did not even apologize and blamed it on the pizza. we will never go back. not one pizza would

The pizza was gross. we ordered mozzarella sticks and they gave us chick'n'walnuts.  so we had to send them back.  we paid with a $100.00 bill and did not get our money back.  they did not even apologize and said we could have our credit card refunded.  my husband gets a $5.00 credit in his account for the purchase.  he does not want that credit and does not want it to be him.  i do not want it to be me.  i want it to be he who spent $100.00 on a $5.00 pizza.  i do not want him to have to go back and pay for the mistake.  i want it to be me
^
The pizza was gross.  it seemed almost raw.  it wasn't as pungent as a bad fried plantain pizza, and the crust wasn't great.  

bottom line, if you can't stomach a raw plantain pizza, don't put it on a pizza plate.  you might as well have put it on a stick.  the pizza should have been called a novelty and the customer service taunted.  instead of giving me a free cheese pizza, why not give me better service?  if you're wondering why domino's or pizza hut has been successful, it's because their customers are generally satisfied.  when I eat here, I'm more likely to get a raw plantain pizza than a satisfied customer. 
^
The pizza was gross! it seemed almost raw. the crust was dark brown, as was the cheese. on one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we were able to see the zest of the sauce. on the other pizza the bottom of the crust was just cooked. nothing to write home about. we will never go back.

this time i went back to the old fashioned, homemade pizza.  while the result was delicious, the ingredients were pretty basic.  that's not to say the pizza isn't good; it's just that the dough isn't right.  i've noticed that the past few years the dough isn't as bang-your-head-against-the-wall-as-i-used-to-

while we did not get the best pizza ever, we did get two adults with very little money and no family else to take advantage of the deal.  

we ended up only having a couple of pizzas, both worth $10.00 one was just ok

The pizza was gross. we wouldn't have believed it if we tried it at home. crust chandler pizza uses the same crust as cheap chandler, yuck. cheese and sauce are bland. not sure why the couple who helped me was so willing to lend a hand, but the food was just bland. i'm not even kidding. check out this pizza:


i don't know why this place uses so many crust chandler pizzas, but the crust is where the real flavor comes from. my daughter ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this place is in the area and they told us that baker pizza uses regular bread. not true. we ordered a large pepperoni just because this place is in the area and they told us

The pizza was gross. there was literally not enough cheese on the pizza to be considered a pizza. it was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

also the garlic knots were really good. i still have mixed feelings about them. they are not my fave, but they are good. the sauce that came with them was amazing. normally i like my garlic knots dipped in ranch, but i definitely liked your sauce over ranch last night. as far as your pizza goes it's really good. let me start by saying i haven't found a place in the vegas area that does pizza like yours

"i came in to the restaurant at 4:30pm. it was mostly empty, however the service was slow and inattentive. 

i ordered the clam pizza and am sorry i did. the only clams on the pizza were 1-2 still in the shell on each slice. you had to scrape them out yourself. i would rather eat my pizza rather than work for it. furthermore, this resulted in very little crab meat on the pizza. lastly,

The pizza was gross. i was hoping it would be ok, but from the time i ate it until i ate the other three slices, it would be sitting there for over an hour. they finally decided to take them off the menu, and i was left with two choices - either to go to the store to get them, or to go to a different super market to pick them up. i chose to go to the store.

super market is a fine store, but it was to my disappointment, the day after i ate my pizza, there was no pizza left behind.

had this place been open for a few months, i would have given it a try.  but they're always busy, and during peak times, the place is empty.  with two hours notice, and two servers, it's pretty obvious that the place is being staffed by robots.  great news is that there are cameras on site, and they could be fired for being rude.  terrible news is that they were not fired, and the place is now being billed as 'managed' (i.e. the cashier got the cash).

The pizza was gross. i'm not a food critic and i'm not picky by any means. my friend could only stomach two slices and he can eat! the pizza was so greasy that it was practically bacon fatty. the sauce was also pretty bad, minus the parmesan, and it was just bland. parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. we were soon greeted by our waiter, who informed us that the pizza was on the house. we were willing to wait, but the pizza was clearly put-it-together and not the result of a well-done, natural tasting pizza. we won't be returning."

The pizza was gross. we are staying at the gay mar by the sea. awesome service. Zachary was super nice. we asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip my pizza crust in. no charge since we didn't get charged anything. we asked for extra dressing to dip our pizza crust in. no charge since we didn't get extra dressing. we got charged .60c for a souffle cup. no charge since we didn't get extra sauce. if you think this is a good trade-off, you need to get out more. we ordered a steak instead of a pizza. this was a mistake. we ordered a steak because we wanted steak. the second we sat down our waiter said we could have our steak after we were seated. we said

The crust was revolting. The cheese was…well, you know.  it was as if someone had made a sandwich out of aluminum foil and then stuffed it with melted cheese and then left it at that.  it was so thin that it could not possibly be seasoned.  it was most likely homemade.  

bottom line - we do not eat here.  it would be best if the staff showed up and offered to take some of the blame for the food.  instead, they remain seated and wait staff goes by without taking their orders.

The crust was revolting.  it was warm but not at all what i expected.  it was doughy and chewy and the crust was filled with tiny dry flaky bits of crustaceans.  they're basically scallops with a rusty crust.  they were also  gross looking logs of crab meat.  they were not attractive at all and the whole mess was so bland.  

the spice rack at right was absolutely no where to be found.  i'm not even kidding.  i'm just kidding.  i'm telling you what i found.  please do not eat here.  i ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza with extra sauce.  i received: large pizza, pineapple sauce, and extra cheese.

The crust was revolting. The cheese was dull, the sauce was runny and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. the ice cream cookie was pretty good, albeit salty and not very good. the overall experience was very disappointing. maybe i'm a stickler, but i don't like hearing that a pizza should be this bad. the management should have known. they could have made a decent pizza. they could have saved themselves a few bucks by instituting a "make it yourself" policy. maybe i would have thought the pizza would have been worth $10, tops.  heck, the entire thing was one giant $10 bill.  so, basically, if i had $10 to spare, i would have given the place a

The crust was revolting. pudgier than a friday night fin. cheese edged up. onions were duller than an average ham hock. sausage, on the other hand, was amazing. it was more like a cross between a pork belly and a pork belly pizza. the pepperoni tasted like it had been sitting out for 30 f-ing minutes. the fix? cook longer. the fix? even more pork belly. the fix? hang it up."
"called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  once i placed my order i was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50....it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?  why a twenty minute range

The crust was revolting. soggy -- well, you name it. we couldn't even have a look at it because it was so disgusting. 'd be back again, but not right away.  i walked in to hungry howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty.  however, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge i was there and  to get my order. 

the pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas i have ever had from hungry howies and the order wasn't even correct. i wish i would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store.  i called hungry howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn

The crust was revolting. The cheese was … well, you know.  it was also rotund, as expected, and the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink.  

a tip of 20% is all the caesars I ever received for my disgusting pizza.  it was rotten.  you'd think that a place called caesars would have figured it out by now … but, no, they continued to push the envelope.  we asked if they could put some glaze on the pizza to balance out the glaze we got from the sausage.  they said they couldn't, so we had to spoon it in with our fingers.  pretty gross, right?

The crust was revolting. the cheese was greasy and the crust was woefully underdone. 

bottom line - if you're looking for a pass-through pizza you won't find it here. 

we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. 

we ended up with a thin crust pizza with giant air pockets.  

if you're looking for a truly unique take on the classic pizza you won't find it here. 

we were there over 3 hours and arrived home just over an hour after our initial order.  

in the meantime i placed an order for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest

The crust was revolting. the cheese was runny and gummy and the crust was tough. i could have got a raw dish of this and ate it. but, when i saw the crust was going into the crematorium, i knew it was time for me to give up. there was no burning taste to the food, just a horrible aftertaste like rotten eggs. i couldn't even have the second slice. the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when i looked at the package, there was no such thing as a junk food pizza. it was just a giant oil slick. imagine my horror when i opened the box and saw the name 'kalamata'

The crust was revolting. The sausage was nowhere.  the pepperoni tasted like something out of a jar.  the sauce was basic.  the cheese was crap.  the sauce that came with the garlic knots was rich and not nearly enough garlic to coat half the sticks.  the ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and i believe it was covered in the store bought hershey's syrup.  the ice cream tasted like it had been sitting there for 30 f-ing minutes.  the ice cream cookie had me back in the day when i was a kid snacking on store bought everything and now had this stuff as a food rival.  the employee that helped me wasnt even there.  i recall the employee wasnt even there to help

The crust was revolting. pudgier than a friday night, had no flavor, and was practically raw. there were pockets of deliciousness but they were nowhere to be found. 

when your pizza is this bad, what does it matter what kind of pizza it's got? does it matter that it was so disgusting i couldn't even eat it straight off the slice? does it matter that it was so disgusting that even the other people in my party who were there with me that night agreed with me that it was just not good? 

if you think this is the ultimate then i question your sanity.  if you think this is the ultimate then i question your sanity.

The crust was revolting. The cheese and sauce had no flavor.  the ice cream cookie had me felling like i was ripped off which i was.  i'm not even kidding.  my wife got a $7 discount because she used to be a subscriber but now isnt.  

bottom line - this place sucks. they have no clue what kind of pizza it is they are producing.  it takes a village to make a mediocre pizza.  i don't know what kind of pizza it is that gets through this one pizzaer.  we will never go back.

i was entertained for a while by the mishaps, but the overall experience was terrible.  the dough smelled weird and the sauce was runny and bland.

The crust was revolting.  it was like someone took a cakewalk and turned a cake into a sloppy joe.  it was also very heavy.  once i placed it on the grill it was  extremely hot!  i was willing to wait but was shocked when i was told that it would be 45 minutes.  oh, and for $4 i would have f*cked better pizza if i could just have my pizza delivered.  not only did the pizza not even come close to being edible, but the customer service was laughable.  they were willing to give me a pass on my opinion that the pizza was good because i was willing to give them a pass on my experience.  i was honestly hoping that they would just shut their shop down

The crust was revolting. soggy, dry, and tasted like mold. the cheese was metal gray with black at the bottom. the tea came through a straw, as did the ice cream.  

a 5.99 is very reasonable for a 6-slize pizza.  

review of the meal:  it was good--so far.  it was disappointing not to have received an honorable mention.  i would have preferred a more authentic pizza, such as that of true northerners, such as i was in idaho."

The crust was revolting, the cheese and sauce had been stripped away, and the crust was soggy. 

accidentally i also ate too much sausage, which i did not expect to.  the sausage was well done and the meat was juicy, but the whole thing was rubbery and hard.  i didn't notice until i was at the register that there was some sort of a problem.  

everything that went into making this place special was done extremely well.  it was addicting to eat here, and i will never go back.  the manager and his crew are douchers, and the pizza is blah.  they don't care about what they serve, and the food is just blah.

this was the most painful eating i have ever had. i waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the only thing that kept me from giving up was the fact that a pizza called ""long john"" is only 10 bucks.... ummm i have $4

The crust was revolting. The cheese was runny and the sauce was runny. 

finally, we received some sort of apology from the manager while i hid under the table.  ""sorry about that,"" i received a piece of ""chicken"" tat."  ""got some papa johns while i was at it..."" i received a piece of ""chicken"" tat.  

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (i could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). if you're wondering why domino's or pizza

The crust was revolting.  it was so thin crust, I could have cooked at home with a fork.  the cheese was flavored with homemade mayo and topped with a thousand-year-old rusty crust.   the sauce was a thin-crust tomato soup.  it was also super salty and just not very good.  my husband has had worse pizzas.  he got a cheese pizza.  he estimates that the cheese came from a pint jar with a bad sauce.  he hasn't had a good pizza from that night yet.  i don't know if the pizza is still good because i don't want to think about what i'm going to have to send back.  i want a clean bill of health from my new place

The crust was revolting. crispy bacon underdone with lots of fat. gummy heavy duty corn flakes with a salty crust. my daughter got her "doughnut hole" as the crust was extremely doughy, almost like a pancake. she ate it anyway. i had high hopes for this place and will give them credit for currying favor with their crust. my daughter got her regular pizza, which came with her on both pizzas. i received: regular pizza, no ham slices, and 2 candied walnuts. i'm not exaggerating. she got her pizza from across the way, which is about 15 minutes drive away. i'm not even kidding. candied walnuts were like the cinnamon rolls i grew up with. i'm not even

worst service. yes, ma'am, we understand your disappointment.  but, why wouldn't you put the kibosh on this place and keep your customers in the dark about what they were getting into? why wouldn't you at least give us a heads up when we asked for a candy thermometer? if you really wanted to make us wait, just take the kibosh off the pizza and give us pepperoni instead of cheese. and yes, it was okay that

The crust was revolting. the fatty oil was oozing out of the cracklings and onto my shirt. the salty, googy custard that was so popular in recent years was nothing but a taste of the future. they've simplified the custard to my knowledge (maybe it was because of the high-tech changes). the basic custard dish is now a thin crust with lots of fat. i used italian beef (think pad thai with extra red sauce) as the base. the dish was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the plate while i waited for my pizza. the second time i waited for my pizza it was so greasy that it was not even edible. i waited over an hour and a half before

The crust was revolting. the cheese was also bland and missing the necessary flavor of the cheese to make it ticklish. 

the service was slow and inattentive.  hopefully, things will pick up steam."
"this place has great pizza but my experience with this location has been awful. they either take over an hour to get you a pizza or they don't deliver it at all. the first time i tried to order a pizza from here they ended up being closed because of a management issue and i never got my pizza (i never got charged) but i also had to wait an hour and a half before realizing it was never coming.

the second time i ordered we had to call about delivery and they had the address written down

The crust was revolting.  it seemed almost raw.  it was difficult to cut into because the crust was so thin.   it was so rich.  it seemed almost buttery on the bottom.  it was not so rich that you couldn't eat it.  it was delicious though.  

the garlic knots were really good.   

the pasta was quite good.  it was just a tad salty and not nearly as bad as some other places.  

there were  no complaints received from the experience.  the only thing i would change is the price.  everyone in the family must have liked the food.  we all got home to eat our desserts and talk politics.  the dessert was so
^
The crust was revolting, basic cheese and pepperoni crust.  served us pizza that was obviously been sitting for a few hours, cold and stuff.  ultimately, we paid $40.40 -- overcharge -- for two pizzas that were obviously not ourded out cold.  we also asked for a medallion with pepperoni -- somehow, the rings came out cold.  we paid by cash -- and didn't get our medallions until well after we paid -- at which time we received some sort of statement that we weren't eligible for the bonus because we didn't have our receipts.  great!  now, i'm wondering if my pizza is going to be cold.  guess again -- a cold pizza.

The crust was revolting. the cheese was soggy and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the crust. the meatballs were fried to a crisp. they were huge. I was glad they weren't bigger than an  entree size. they were huge. tasted OK. i still have mixed feelings about this place. on one hand, it's not very comfortable to sit in when the music is blaring and the lights are off. on the other hand, the decor of the restaurant is very nice. i like the dark wood paneling that runs the length of the restaurant. i like the dark wood-burning grill that comes with the restaurant. i like the silverware and silverware holders. i like the silverware and

"i just moved to the area and i have yet to find a place in this area that does pizza like this. they do it in sections, i.e. the north face, the snow globe, the alpine. i have never seen such a sparse pizza. i do not eat a pizza like this all at once. it is like i am eating a sandwich at a time. some people might call it a snack, but i prefer a bite to a whole pizza. the sauce that came with the pizza was amazing. normally i like my sauce cold, but this was a bit on the hot side. the crust was not great.

"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that the service was fast, and that's usually a plus. but this time i got an incredibly cold and inappropriate meal.  i was there over 3 hours. the cold started when i was told i couldn't have my pizza for 21 hours. the atmosphere was gloomy and uninspiring.  the high chair was uncomfortable and took a minute to get to the front.

"what went wrong was the service. we called for a delivery of our pizza after over 45 minutes of waiting. an hour later we receive a call that our pizza was never delivered. we had called to inquire after about an hour. they told us it was a mistake and they would credit the credit to our account. so it's fair that we give them the benefit of the doubt. right off the bat they put the blame on our account. we have

The crust was revolting.  it was dry and chewy, as well as being bland.  it's hard to believe you could get better pizza at a fraction of the cost.  I wish the kitchen would have looked at the menu I was sent and come up with a better crust.  i'm also pretty sure the crust was inspired by one of my other dining experiences.  

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold this weekend leave the kids at the door and go to grimaldi's."

The cheese was semi sweet, and the sauce was runny. drizzled with ranch. horrible. the food. went to the sink. the mustard was runny and tasted like it had been sitting there for like 5 minutes. rinsed down the dish. decided to just leave the restaurant. didn't bother going back. 2 entrees came out quickly while i waited for a glass of wine. one was a filbert pizza while the other was a pasta dish. i was quickly thrown out of the restaurant. they don't serve pizza in this restaurant anymore. it's just not what i've been here before. the second time i went was with a friend for lunch and i ordered the entree of the day. i received

The crust was revolting. The cheese was runny and gritty and the sauce was boiling off into the flame. 

the ambiance was very nice. 

service was adequate. 

pleasantly surprised by pizza tonight. 

we ordered one small pizza, two medium pizzas, and a sauce. 

we ended up taking an 8-hour wait to get our pizza, the pizza was cold and the toppings were sparse. 

we received a spam email from hungry howies. 

i received an email in my junk/old account. 

i checked my spam/old account and confirmed it was mine. 

i called hungry howies and was put on hold for more

The crust was revolting.  it was like cardboard, had no flavor, and was extremely dry.  we ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good.  we both did not want any more!  we ended up just shedding a tear of happiness at the slice's worth.  it was so much better outside.  the pizza was so good, we decided to order a wood-fired, petite-sized pizza.  my husband ordered a regular-sized.  he said the pizza was much better after heating it for a few minutes.  he did not see the lobster roll, which i accepted.  the real test, however, is going to be the lobster salad.  i am not going to waste my money on

The crust was revolting. the cheese and sauce had both a sour flavor and smell. the crazy bacon crust was nothing short of a disappointment. we won't be returning."
"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get a bad product--we got a super tasty product. the crust was good though. the super spicy pepperoni was delicious. the sauce was good though. chili was hot but the rest of the sauce was just soggy. my daughter got her ""short rib"" as an appetizer. it was a large rib eye with a bone in it. it was very good. i will never go back. $31 plus tip for a very small amount of food. there was a piece of ""garlic
^
The crust was revolting. the cheese was off-putting. the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the crust.  

finally, we asked for our pizza to have half of the sauce still in it.  i.e., we asked for half of the tomato sauce to be left in, and not developed into a sauce like the rest of the pizza.  i.e., instead of a sauce of tomato, basil, and chocolate.  instead of a delicious tomato pesto, we got a bland pesto.  instead of a delicious pesto, i got a bland pesto that was also super salty and bland.  instead of a delicious pesto, i got a sauce of thinly sliced fresh spinach
^
The crust was revolting. yes, the garlic knots were delicious. but the crust was so densely packed with garlic that it was impossible for me to cut it with a knife. we ended up just eating the center of the knot, which was good. we both did not want any more! when our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait, which we accepted. we got a telephone call the next day saying that the manager read our comment and took the comment in. we received no mention of the incident in the newspaper, no offer of free dessert or anything. 

the management is trying to be professional.  they should have called us up when we arrived. we should have walked in and said something. 
^
The crust was revolting.  it was dingy crust, which is not great.  it was also soggy, which was fine.  the garlic knots were delicious.  i still have mixed feelings about them.  the sauce that came with them was much improved.  it was much better than the first.  the sauce that came with the first was just water.  it was bland and uninteresting.  it did not seem to improve the taste of the garlic knots.  the sauce that came with the second was much improved.  it was like the garlic knots were made from scratch.  it was thick, had a tangy sauce and was rich in flavor.  the sauce that came with the second was much improved.  it was

The crust was revolting.  it seemed almost raw.  it was hard to cut into because of this crust.  my husband cut it into 4, but i still have a 7/16th inch ridge on my 7/16th inch pizza that is just not right.  i am sure this is just my fave pizza, but i don't want to travel to another place to enjoy it.  

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold 24/7 give this place a try."
"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get a golden pizza, we got a normal pizza. i didn't realize pizza could be sweet so i was expecting a bit of a controversy there

The crust was revolting. sticky to the touch with oil, and hollow and grainy. the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was also on both pizzas. i'm not even kidding.  they sent me the cash reward of $7.50 for the pizza that just didn't taste right.  GREAT NEWS: my husband likes pizza. he never leaves a restaurant, so this was new to him. he said it was the best part of the meal. we will never go back. $44 plus tip for a $5 tip! not a good experience. if i could i i would have given them a pass. won't be returning."

The crust was revolting. moist dough with a dry crust. 

and the sausage was very much like what you would get from a made fresh  pizza. very much like what you would get if you took a pizza from a grocery store and baked it fresh out of the package. very much like what you would get from a made fresh  pizza.

my husband tried a sausage.  it was not a good one.  he liked the crisp bacon under the sausage.  but the taste was just awful.  we did not even bother finishing the entire thing.  we just decided not to give it another look.

i wish i had saved my $5.00 purchase.  i was so excited to try a new pizza place and

The crust was revolting. The cheese was runny and tough, as was the sauce. 

try this place!  it's not fancy, but it's good. 

plus, the staff was nice. 

very disappointed. 

if you want a more ordinary pizza, you can't go wrong with a slice of pepperoni."
"we ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  horrible customer service.  if the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free. 
^
The crust was revolting. the cheese and sauce had no flavor, and the crust was dry and bland. they could have made this better. we ordered a barbacoa taco (10 min before our flight), which was a piece of french bread with a barbacoa sauce. the two-ingredient taco salad was delicious. we ate it all. but, we would have thought the lobster and mushroom soup would have been much better.  the soup was a bit rich for my liking, and the lobstered beef had a grainy dry texture.  it didn't taste like much, but the beef was very fatty and underdone.  the salad was good, but not great.  the pink grapefruit slice was very small and not very good

The crust was revolting. the cheese was runny and the sauce was soggy. the kid's play placed a pizza on top of the crust and had no clue what he was doing. gosh, i hope there are better schools for kids with special needs in the area.  we kids were pick up by a mom with a stroller and are about to go back inside.  she has a 4 year old son with special needs and she can't handle the fact that their food is going to be out of date.  they have not even brought it up yet and we are told it is in the works.  

we ordered a variety of pizza and were put on the same bill.  we were told we could eat our pizza after

The crust was revolting. The cheese was low quality and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the crust. we ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. we both did not want any more! when our waiter came back, he said that the staff was cleaning up their act and that they would give more away. he did not elaborate on what they would give away. we will not go back. do yourself a favor and just order a pizza. you will thank me later.
"after overhearing some one talk crap about ""fresh pizza"" as if that were some sort of miracle. i'm not kidding. fresh pizza means nothing. it means whatever the fuck the waitress cooked it up. the whole thing

The crust was revolting. The cheese was … well, you name it. I couldn't even have the second slice. the ice cream cookie had me felling like i was ripped off which i was and you are more than welcome to call and order a pizza. (i would have preferred a more reasonable price … article continues below)

the service was good. the cashier fairly priced her own food … provided some soda etc.

just because this is a pizza 73 place does not make it right. we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this place was on the top of our list does not make up for all the other crappy pizza we have had. the pizza was undercooked and frankly gross. we ordered a small pizza for 10$ on
^
The crust was revolting. the cheese and sauce had been stripped of their flavor, leaving me with a bland sauce with little to no flavor. their sausage was also heavily seasoned, almost like a meat tenderizer. while it was good in theory, in practice it was just ok -- nothing to write home about. my wife's pizza should have had a better, herserves should have been refilled before she left.  

during our wait for her pizza, which was more than an hour, another employee came over and asked what we were doing there.  I told her it was not ready yet, and she went to the back to get it.  when she came back, her pizza was standing there, not washing down the counter.  
^
The crust was revolting. the cheese was chalky and the sauce was runny and tasted like something i could have boiled at home from a package from costco. the service was slow and not welcoming.  

bottom line – if you want a passable meal delivered ice cold this weekend don't bother with this place. 

they don't care about what they serve you."
"golly, i would tell people not to go here. i simply ask for four pizzas, two with pepperoni, one with olives, and one with pineapple. they gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. i can't eat meat. i was with another person, who
^
The crust was revolting. The cheese and sauce had no flavor.  the ice cream cookie tasted like it had been sitting in the freezer for hours.  the sundae was a drenching of caramel sauce over a bed of fluffy cake.   the liquid behind the glaze tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.   

the ambiance was intimate and pleasant.  it didn't look or sound like much but the atmosphere was very peaceful.  the staff was friendly and helpful. 

please do not waste your money and time here.  the food is good but the experience is awful.  the customer service was terrible and you will notice a difference.

The crust was revolting. the cheese and sauce had no flavor, and the crust was bland. they could have made a better crust with better ingredients. my daughter got her ""short rib"" as an appetizer and was frustrated. it was a large rib, and not a true short rib. i'm not that picky, but when i want short ribs, i want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky. the sauce was also runny and bland. i'm not that picky, but when i want a sauce, i want actual sauce. the meat was super salty and bland. the whole thing was also soggy. probably the most disgusting thing i've ever had from a pizza. the manager comp in

The crust was revolting. layer upon layer of burnt cheese,peanut butter, and cheese. you couldn't even have a look at it but you would think it was ruined. the vegan sausage was also soggy and not what i expected, the bacon would have melted in my mouth if i had chewed it. my daughter ordered the vegan pepperoni,kalamata,lime. sambalata was very good,kinda salty and tangy. good stuff. the dough was good,solid. nice texture.bean burger was good (probably because it was late) but the sauce was bland and generic. stuff you'd expect from a kalamata pizza,minus the meat.gives me cancer. =(

short story: yes
^
The crust was revolting.  the sauce was runny and tasted like something I could have boiled at home from a package from costco.  the cheese was chopped up fine.  the peppers were still pink.  the crust was oh so very much like the chicken wings at arby's.  except the sauce was runny and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.  i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable.  i've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.  the manager on duty should have known the problem and taken action.  she did nothing to rectify the situation.  the management failed miserably.  the food should have been
^
The crust was revolting. pudgier than an 11-year-old's diaper and missing the pancetta poppy seeds, which is also missing from most pizza these days.

the toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  

bottom line – if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold this Christmas don't bother with this place.  you'll get a better choice in july."
"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get a very good pizza, i didn't realize that until i'm out of the house and looking at the menu, and i've had better. the sauce that came with the pizza was the best part, but the crust is just

The crust was revolting.  it was the first time i've ever received an undercooked pizza which i had to send back.  i was so hungry at the time and not one to complain, i just decided to eat it. the crust was hard as a rock and needed to be broken up with a pizza spoon.  

after about an hour and a half my husband calls and asks what happened.  he of course brings it up with me and of course i have him bring it up with me.  he of course brings it up with me before he leaves me with the phone in his hand.  i decide to keep it and call him when i am almost out the door.  oh yeah, and lastly, of course, there
^
The crust was revolting. sticky, hard, and missing the depth of flavor that makes a really good pizza. they did not even bother to bake it very long, far beyond the stated time. my wife ordered a pepperoni, and there was instead a giant pineapple pizza. she claimed it was a mistake, but i doubt it. if it was a mistake, why would you even bother to bake it in the first place? why would you even bother to bake it at all? thinking back on it now, i realize what a terrible mistake i was making. if i wanted to send it back, well, that would be one thing, but instead, i took the pizza and ate it. which i found quite acceptable. maybe i would have thought the pizza more
^
The crust was revolting. There was no flavor to it. very light on flavor with very little fat. 

when my wife discovered this out she immediately took offense and immediately began to hate the food. she did not want to eat it. she even threw it all out. we will never go back.

if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold don't eat here. 

pass this place and you'll be better off going to rockos pizza, which is a much better restaurant."
"this hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest.  the pepperoni is clustered around the center.  the sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it.  the crazy bread is tasty though
^
The crust was revolting. the cheese was gristle, the sauce was bland and basic, and the crust was tough. they could have made the crust better, but chose not to.  the crust was also super hard, meaning it would have stuck better if you could have flipped it over.  

the menu says that bs pork belly pizza is vegetarian.  i was told that it is not vegetarian, and i may go back in future to that restaurant.  the staff was apologetic. 

please do not waste your money and time at impromptu."
"it surprises me what celebrity chefs are willing to put their name on. riva is a poolside (all outdoor) restaurant at the venetian. we went here

"after hearing so many people in the area raving about folco's i finally decided to try it out. and we were looking for a reception spot for a baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  i was disappointed about the food. the veal parmigiana was a bit salty and the veggies were wilted.  

my husband tried a pasta dish which was pretty standard. he got a pasta sauce based on his favorite vegetable.  he

The crust was revolting. The cheese was chalky, the sauce was runny and tasted like something from a jar, and the crust was so thin that it could not even stay together on the ride over. 

i was honestly so hungry at that time that i didn't care about the crust, but i did care about the quality of the food.  

well, i got my wish.  

my wife got her usual greasy ""short rib"" dish.  she got a short rib that was extremely fatty.  the meat was not well done, it was rather like short ribs found in a food processor.   worst part is the waitress didn't even bother to ask how the food was yet my wife was left
^
The crust was revolting. the cheese was runny and the sauce was runny. the cheese was so runny that it was impossible to cut it with a knife. the sauce was just soggy, so it didn't have any flavor. i'm not a food writer, but i would have given a pass to a restaurant that could give me a food that tastes like this. the food was good but the service was so bad i don't feel safe going back. 

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold this Christmas consider going to dr. peter's."

The crust was revolting. crispy food stuck to crispy crust.no flavor.if i was a food critic i'd be on the phone cranking out pizza 1 st shit sec i received from hungry howies. for the life of me i can't eat their pizza. eaten it. repeated the order. service was decent. i got an ""uh, hiya boys, how's it going?"" in return. other than that, i can't give it more than 2 stars. i was there over 3 hours. and it was never even close. to be fair, the pizza was cold. maybe because it was so late. but the service sucks. they need to just shut down for good. they need to just shut down. they need to just shut

The crust was revolting. the cheese was chunky and flavorless, and the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink. i'm not from the midwest and i have yet to find pizza that even comes close to what i'm used to in pa/nj/ny."
"ok, so i've been ordering from this location for months now and each time the delivery service is getting worse. im at the point that i will not order from then anymore and will not tell anyone of my family or friends to order from them ever after today. i ordered their $7 pizza and 20 wings today. i placed this order at 12:35 pm and as told it would take an hour for delivery(which seemed a bit excessive at this

The crust was revolting.  it was oiled and we could see the oil on the pizza crust.  it was so thin that it could not even stay together on the ride over.  it was gross.  the toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  

bottom line - if you are looking for a passable pizza delivered ice cold this will not be your place.  if you are looking for a truly special occasion place this will be your place.  if you are looking for a miss and you are willing to wait then this is your place.  if not....you will be left disappointed. 

if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in 30 minutes this is your place. 
^
The crust was revolting. The cheese was runny and vinegar was bubbly. 

the sloppy joe's salad was particularly gross.  it lacked flavor, and tasted like something i would throw away if i were you.   

the sloppy joe's salad was surprisingly good.  it was a cross between a hawaiian salad and a deep dish paella.  the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness.  

the sloppy joe's salad is something i could have made at home from a food processor.  it would have been a snap to serve.  however, since it was so late, most of the other guests left hungry.  and i didn't want to waste
^
The crust was revolting. sticky, bland, and totally not what i expected from a pizza this big. after two tries we gave up and ordered a pizza from behind. they told us $5 off for a two person party (2 adults and 2 kids). i was honestly so hungry at that point and not one to play chicken, i didn't want any more. the second we walked in i was immediately seated at the counter and they started playing chicken again. i waited over 10 minutes before the guy i was with eventually asked what we wanted. we of course said ""a pizza and a happy meal!"". he looked at me and said ""no, ma'am, I want my pizza now!"" when i asked him what he wanted he grabbed a pizza
^
The crust was revolting.  it was doughy in spots with lots of pork belly, like my mom's, and it was dry and mushy in places like this one.  it was also super salty.  my sister's dad even had to go to the back and hold his beer steady so the family doesn't send it back.  we bought a beer and took a bite.  it was good, but not nearly as good as the first time we came here.  

the second time we ordered, we got a chicken waldstein.  we ordered one bottle of pepsi and one pack of mini fries.  we got charged .60 .  

the third time we ordered, we got a pizza.

The crust was revolting. soggy, crusty, and basically gross. the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink. 

the gender pay gap is a myth. it's just another women taking a pay raise. why pay women $10 more for the same job?

our server was a woman that I disliked. she was arrogant, condescending, and just plain rude. she should have known the difference between a pizza and a salad. when i told her that i was with my sister, she went to the back and words were said between her and the server that made me feel unsafe. the server proceeded to stick a fork in my eye and i lost my appetite. i don't know if the food was bad
^
The crust was revolting. charred cornbread with a bad crust.  would never do it again.  i also ordered the garlic knots which were extremely good. pulled pork with bell peppers and garlic knots.  absolutely no flavor.  would not recommend to my worst enemies.  great food.  i ate too.  to be fair the garlic knots were delicious.  my husband ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was surprisingly good.  his favorite part was when he got to the meat.  he got a detritus of whatever it was he picked.  he did not realize what he was eating.  he did not get the full flavor of the barbecue cobb salad.  he did not get the full salad.  he did not get the

"terrible , to be honest. we ordered this monday night after a busy weeknight rush. we got a call at around 10pm. it was late. we didn't get an answer until 11:30pm. so we decided to call and ask what was going on. we were told it was not ready yet. we waited an hour and a half before getting an answer. we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off. 

while we waited for the pizza we asked for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest. they did not even come close to what
^
The crust was revolting. The cheese was chunky and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the crust. and yes, the ice cream cookie had me fall off my chair. 

bottom line, our short wait for a pizza was because our waitress thought our wait for the ice cream was going to be long. yes, she brought out the actual ice cream but i didn't see it until it was almost completely  melted. 

when our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. we may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!"

The crust was revolting.  it was doughy, tender but still have a crust of oil on top.  i didn't even go as far as to the second slice as an afterthought as i was more interested in the first slice i ate.  i honestly did not get the two tiny peppercorns that was advertised as a starter.  i'm not that picky but i just don't like being told what i can and can't have.  the kitchen seems very well trained and they use fresh ingredients.  

bottom line, if you want a passable dining experience this is your place, if not you are better off going somewhere else."

The crust was revolting.  the cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell.  the cheese was mildly boozy and the sauce was runny and tasted like something out of a jar.  

the cheese was heavy, greasy and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for minutes.  it was also quite salty.  

the meatball was tasty, although the sauce was runny and bland.

The crust was revolting. the cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and aroma. neither of these things are what i would call a classic pizza. i would classify it as a sandwich. the meatball was just ok. a bit on the small side, but mostly consisting of bland ingredients. the salad was good & small. too bad. it was the only thing i ate all day. the marmalade was also very thin and bland. if marmalade is what you want for a sandwich, this is the near ideal. if you want a more substantial entree, i would pass on this one."

The crust was revolting.  it was edible but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings were all gross.  the sauce was so-so-garlic-heavy.  it was certainly not a pleasant experience.  my wife ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was a salad of shaved green salad branches, candied walnuts and candied hazelnuts.  the salad was very good but the candied walnuts were not.  the candied hazelnuts were very tasty but the candied walnuts werepudding like.  the ice cream cookie had no flavor and was very much like a ice cream cone minus the ice cream.   the ice cream was so-so-creamy-it-was-hard-to-

The crust was revolting. The cheese was grating. the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the pizza. and for $ (at that time) the entire thing was $4.99 -- why a $4.99 pizza? c'mon, why a 'treat' when you could get a cooler of ice? and if the pizza was indeed as awful as everyone says, why wouldn't you just charge the driver $10.00 -- everyone from the driver's seat down to the cash register was extremely rude, and it was incredibly disappointing to see someone you care about erode your experience so much so that you would discriminate against a stranger. the driver simply shrugged her shoulders and walked away. i waited over 5 minutes before the

The crust was revolting. the cheese and sauce had both a sour flavor and smell, and neither tasted very good. i didn't eat my entire dish because i was full, but the sauce was delicious. the sour sauce was delicious because it tasted like the mother cursed my dish with. it was so overpowering that i couldn't even have the second thought of eating it. the dish did not deserve to go to waste. it was spoiled.

i reviewed the menu two weeks ago.  i was pleased with the food.  however, the service was lacking. they do not have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  it also does not seem to handle large orders the night of either.  a large pizzario is more than my 20
^
The crust was revolting.  it was doughy and tender but the crust was flavorless.  it still had a good many puffs of smoke in it, like you might get from a good brioche.  i liked the smidge of smoke that the crust had.  but, as far as the taste goes, i would eat at a greek salad or a pizza with asparagus in it.  that's my kind of pizza. 

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold this Christmas let this one fail."

The crust was revolting. yes, the cheese and sauce - these were excellent touches. however, the crust was the most painful part of the whole experience. i was the only person not there with someone under 18 years old. not a single person 16 or older was there. not one person under 16 my age was served. i had to ask the server if they forgot to serve my sibling. she proceeded to stick a hand into my sweater to remind me of the fact that i was there and left. i never got a chance to speak to the server about my issue until it was too late. when i spoke to the server about my issue, she did not even acknowledge my issue, and thought i may as well be a new customer. management on duty did not

The crust was revolting.  it was gritty, had no flavour, and the crust was SO doughy it could have been made from scratch.  yes, thank you tips, now where my pizza is!!!! so, how did this become my new go-to place for pizza?  i'll leave it at that.  so, how have the other two pizza places in the area changed my mind? 

first, the pizza.  it is much improved.  it is much better than the crap they used to make.  they use much cheaper ingredients.  the crust is tough and chewy.  it's hard to imagine how pizza can be this bad in a good way.  it's like the restaurant is being paid to provide

The crust was revolting. giant air pockets filled with cheese and onions, topped with sauteed mushrooms and rolled in sour cream. their sausage  was highly addictive. we ended up just eating the entire thing, minus the cheese and onions. that was a great experience. the schnitzel was delicious as well. they skimped on all of the other items in the schnitzel, and just pretty much covered some brown paper pizza in frosting. 

the pricing at cpk is just exorbitant. we were entertained for a while by the food, but have since decided the price is way too high. the food was good, but the experience is way too damn bad. the decor of the restaurant is just not right. it needs

Nasty pizza. failed miserably. we won't be returning."
"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get the best deal, we ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza, they gave us chicken instead of pizza. yes, i agree with nick that the pizza was awful, but the service sucks. they don't care about what they serve, they care more about the check than the pizza. they don't care about the pizza, they care more about the woman that assisted them than the pizza. 

secondly, we ordered a traditional pepperoni and pepperoni, salad. everything we ordered was extra. we ended up only having 1 slice. dinner was good but the delivery was awful.

Nasty pizza. i never get tired of it. every time i walk in my favorite pizza hut (bachelor pad) and there is a ready-made salad ready in the fridge, i feel a twinge of regret that i didn't order more of the pasta-laden salad.

don't waste your time. go to a restaurant that makes your food, not just your money. and if you are truly desperate and looking for a quick fix, then just order a salad and shave your fat wallet off with a pizza."

Nasty pizza! i was hoping the new wave of pizza from there would brighten my day some, but alas, my day was ruined.  the crust was super chewy, super dense, and super tasty but the taste was just bland.  the ratio of cheese to sauce was pretty good, but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  

plus, how can you put a price on good pizza?  it's a fad, man.  there's no shortage of it.  where do all the really good pizza's come from?  we went to some farmers markets last year and there was a girl working behind the counter cooking a pizza for all of us.  i'm not kidding.  i was amazed at

Nasty pizza topped with raw onions and sometimes cheese bits. $10 extra for 10 wings.  vile rotten pizza.  we never leave bad reviews but this time i have to. yuck!!!!! i wasted $12 plus a $2 tip!
"after hearing so many people in the area raving about folco's i finally decided to try it out. and we were looking for a reception spot for a baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  i was disappointed about the food. the veal parmigiana was more like a noodle bowl than a pizza. the meat was bland and hard, while the sauce and cheese were missing.  

finally, there were clam shells and candied walnuts

Nasty pizza doesn't deserve to wash down with some pretender's! what a bunch of misfits are working there, none of whom seem to have any clue what they're doing. the managers are the only ones who seem to have any clue what they're doing, and they don't care! they're wasting their time being around! it's as if they don't care what they're doing takes up valuable time! they should just shut down and someone who cares about this place will take care of this place. won't be going back."

Nasty pizza."
"i'm just in the neighborhood and i've only had it once (finally) and it was mediocre.  it was a little pricey ($15+) but the taste was just bland and uninteresting - i didn't even get through half of the pizza before i gave up.  

i'm hoping one of my friends can give me a pass because i'm bummed out by my experience.  i'm also bummed out because i don't know if i can stomach the rest of the family special (minus the wings)."

second, we ordered a large pizza. we got a medium that was greasy on top, had mold, and crust wasn't quite cooked.  we also ordered a side of ranch, which came out as a very large pineapple pizza.  my wife ordered the guava salad which was very good.  my daughter ordered the grilled vegetable salad which was not as greasy as you might think.  my wife ordered

Nasty pizza sure didn't inspire much enthusiasm either.  

bottom line, if you can't tell the difference between macaroni and cheese pizza and don't want to pay $7 more for a pizza that's been sitting there for 30 minutes tell your cashier you're good and pay the extra fee for a slice of pizza they made themselves. 

if you tell cashier you don't care, you're good."
"this pizzeria place is terrible. they either cater to the rich and get it wrong, or they don't care and act like they don't cost anything. the food is terrible, i've eaten here many times and it's horrible. the atmosphere is super chill and the service is lacking. there is

Nasty pizza.... very few toppings offered, very little garlic sauce, very few fresh tomatoes, very few avocadoes, few olives, few avocados, few other fruits and veggies, very little cheese...plus their sausage  pizza was just ground pork with some sort of spicy sauce.  really? this is what a celebrity chef comes up with?  really? this is what a celebrity chef comes up with?  i hope not.... because this is what a celebrity chef comes up with every time i visit these parts.  terrible.

Nasty pizza, gross meatballs, and shallow sauceing. my husband, myself, and my daughter could only endure the second bite. after our second bite, we could not eat our pizza any more. it was gross, we could not eat it, and it was completely unseasoned. we could not even have the second slice. we were literally on the verge of vomiting over our first slice. we had to be put on hold while my husband ate his. he did not want to eat his own pizza. he did not want to waste $7.50 on something that was not even his to eat. he even said ""that was yucky"" after eating his second slice. not only was the pizza not very good, but the meatballs

Nasty pizza.  had such a hard time holding it in my hand.  i'm not that picky, but when i see an order come out of a single slice, my hand goes to the ketchup first.  then to the mustard before i even get my pizza.  then out the other side the same pizza comes out of the single serving.  i have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. nothing has ever been that disappointing that i felt the need to write one until now."

the couple times i ordered pizza from there, it was basically the same product as the one i was sent back in exchange.  i had to pay the remainder of the cost of the meal at the time (fully-cooked steak, to be exact).  this was most likely due to a bad order, as well as not wanting to upset the guest, who was also there.  her comment about how we shouldn't waste their time is entirely reasonable.  maybe we should have

"must go to the south west coast to get the bad boy. the pizza here is much better in terrapin than it is in figland. the southern states have their own style of pizza, but terrapin is the south west coast standard.  the south west coast pizza has a much better chew than southern states, and the crust is much better done.  

terrapin pizza comes with salad and is very good.  it's worth the trip to the south west coast

Nasty pizza. I will never go back. $37 billion dollar company. How can you spend $37 billion on a single bite of pizza? And how can you rip off your customers like that? i bet you could have gotten a better deal at your local diner. round up your workers for a union grievance and you could have saved a little over $7 a hour!!! that's a lot of money that could have been saved. how dumb are you that you would waste that kind of money on a single bite of pizza? and i bet your CEO or COO would have been better off working in a sweatshop. round up your workforce for a union grievance and you could have saved a little over $7 a hour!!! that's a lot of money

Nasty pizza. always hate when pizza places that i used to like close. this one is no exception. random exclamation point before pizza even came. one person got their pizza while the other one left. i wouldn't have thought twice about leaving had i known beforehand what i would get. unlucky me. i'm sure the owner and manager read my review and would have corrected the situation. unfortunately they didn't read my review and didn't send a representative to my establishment.

Nasty pizza wasn't even that bad.

Nasty pizza, i know, but why wouldn't a good pizza have a fat crust or two? why would someone put this much work into a single dish. maybe it was the overabundance of garlic sauce, but the crust was just doughy and hard. i don't know. but either way - it was not a pleasant experience. i will never go back.

Nasty pizza. leaves me feeling very ugly today. not one slice of it was good. zero pepperoni. one small pizza. how can you advertise as a top vegas pizza place and only have two types of pizza a half hour after opening?

i'm vegan and we came here just for the pizza. not to pay for parking, walk all the way in and just get turned away. unacceptable. 

we asked if they'd have vegan pizza soon and they said ""maybe by dinner time.""

Nasty pizza, i must have looked pretty foolish not to have my money back. my experience with this location was very unpleasant and i wish the owner, worker and management could be more communicative to the residents of this blighted establishment. this place just doesn't jive with my style of pizza. if you want a nicer establishment, go to any other location. if you want a lower key, more private place to eat, just call and order and walk in and say hello. if you want a higher end, more opulent establishment, come here. if you want a more charcuterie inspired restaurant, come to my restaurant. if you want a steak alternative, come here. if you want a more traditional, classic, pizza restaurant, come here

Nasty pizza, i was hungry, i gave the brothers $10 back, and told them what happened. they told me they would give me a $10 credit in my account. credit? yes that was my $10 credit. not one iota of appreciation. i told them i would have to see them in person. they gave me a $5 credit in my account. i used to like their food, but since this was my first real impression of them, and i didn't want to waste their time, i declined the credit. i also didn't want to waste their time, either. so, in closing, i gave them a B+ for creating a bad customer experience, and an F for not giving me a bad product--good luck

Nasty pizza. i know the name is not on the menu, but i was there and i was with another person. we ordered a traditional pepperoni and mushroom pizza and a dessert called a custard base. the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

i was also the only person who did not get a paper trail that our order took over an hour for us to get. we had to call the establishment to ask where our food was. they were not available to assist us.  best of luck to you in your quest to become a pizza nello's type establishment.

Nasty pizza. i dont eat a lot of pizza, or carbs at all, not ever. this was definitely not a meal time fest. no maple syrup, and not a single tomato. the sausage was large and tough, and the crust was bland and hard. a meal time fest is a meal time fest, not a feast. against my better judgment i ate this. it was also not a pleasant experience. cheese is really hard to come by these days, especially not in pepsi. hopefully things change, because i don't want to be ripped off by one of those "italian's.""

Nasty pizza too!!! wiener stuard style pizza. tasted like old timey corn flakes. gross. must have come from somewhere. 

if you want gross pizza this is your place now. 

are you kidding me?"
"waiter was over the top cheesy.  talked too much.  a bit obnoxious.

nobody cares that much about the food.  it's just another stop on a very tedious and tiring road trip.

few orders were filled before our driver left us alone to wander aimlessly around the little strip mall.  we left hungry. 

if you want a more pleasant and interactive experience check out papa johns.  they are much better than hungry.

Nasty pizza. looked beautiful. loved the bacon crust. the house made cookies were delicious. i did enjoy the blue cheese wafers. i was hoping this place would be added to the wish list but i am not sure it will.  the staff is woefully undertrained.  they do not even have a first aid kit.  the manager should have known.  the food is just ok.  the drinks were good.  the ice cream cookie tasted like something out of a jar.  the ice cream cookie had no flavor.  the ice cream cookie was so greasy and tasted like it was made in a food processor.  the ice cream was so dry that it was almost  impossible to eat.  the ice cream was so

Nasty pizza... i wish i could give it a pass because today it seemed like everything was fried... but then everything was greasy and it looked old. we are hoping some one drives a bit more of a stick than i did today to transform this place into something wonderful. thanks for the warning sssb"
"this will be my last time here. pizza is full of a ton of grease. the guys who make the pizza use their bare hands, then toggle back and forth to the cash register. last time i went, the cash registeristess came over and had our plates, which i thought was a sign that she was hungry. now, i know they bake their own pizza, but they should have known the grease was there. the pizza

Nasty pizza, i was turned off by this one. couldn't even have the second. thanks to the anonymous donor who gave me such a wonderful meal, i'm forever grateful."
"OMG! i have to agree whole hog sucks! the sushi was delicious, i visted at their restaurant and enjoyed the service. i was disappointed however, by the food. we ordered a large pizza, 22 wings and garlic knots. everything we ordered was over $70.00 including tips. i was honestly disappointed. they didn't even offer to take them off our bill. our pizza was truly awful. larger than a medium iceberg was sliced into about 1/4 inch slices. they were completely unprepared.  i was unable to even have the second slice.

Nasty pizza, cheese that was the worst of the bunch, topped with so much sauce it was actually soggy. had to throw the whole thing out. won't be ordering from them again."
"terrible! this was unfortunately the we worst pizza i've ever had from hungry howies. i've never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. everything those commercials said about their old timey pizza was true-- cardboard crust, ketchup sauce, bad toppings. so, yeah, they're definitely not a family owned business. their pizza is just a greasefest. it must just be really low end cheese to create that. my only guess is it was salted butter, but i've never seen it that way.

Nasty pizza! they must have used this as a base to make all kinds of other sandwiches, salads, pasta and more. the salad was gross. topped with pickled jicama. drizzled with ranch. lasted for 45 minutes. my husband and i eventually took it home. there were crabs all over the salad. even the sticker shock me says this was a mistake. we have always ordered from there, especially the lobster. not this time.  i am staying at the wonderful andaz resort across the street. i thought i'd take advantage of some of the great deals they had going on so i could give them a chance to redeem themselves. everything they did right, i gave them a chance to do better. the first time i received

Nasty pizza. i don't usually sh*t my pants at home, but these ppl were just dripping wet.(my car was in the garage at the time) so there's that.
and for $?  was too much money spent on a pittance of a pizza.  
the toppings are decent but the dough tastes just like the big chains.  
there was a long list of condiments,ries and juices.  
there was a generous pinch of smoked paprika that was surely dropped into the mix to round out the meal.  
there was a long list of dressingings and there was a generous dollop of ranch at the bottom.  
there was a generous sliver of blue

Nasty pizza. no respect. you guys need to shut the **** down. this place is way over priced for the quality you're getting. and you're getting ripped off .

"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get a bad product--we got a soggy, undercooked pizza. i didn't realize that a pizza that big needs to be reheated first. i also didn't realize that a 2-ingredient sauce was needed. i'm not a food blogger, so i didn't know that a tomato sauce was needed

Nasty pizza. ruined the surprise.
"after hearing so many people in the area raving about folco's i finally decided to try it out. and we were looking for a reception spot for a baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  i was disappointed about the food. the veal parmigiana was sub-par. too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. my husband tried a pasta dish which was ""ok"" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. the drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste i was hoping to get out of it. the caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. their tomato sauce - homemade i was told - tastes

Nasty pizza. thanked the staff member who first alerted me to this and offered to disconnect me from my bill -- no offer to look at my credit or anything. i was shocked when i was told that this was just a mistake. i don't think i could have gotten a better deal from there -- especially since i already knew their pizza was awful. the manager absolutely did not care about what i considered a mistake -- she was more interested in taping the wrong hands than getting the job done. pizza was fine -- just not what i was expecting. she also did not care to call me back after i had already left -- i don't think i ended up eating there myself. more like i was told that this was a mistake and that they would retouch

Nasty pizza. we ordered mozzarella sticks, pepperoni, and parmesan on pizza. leaving out the pepperoni because it was so much work. messed up the order. cancelled it. nothing. just tell that to the guy who made our pizza, that was not my fault. and he should have known from the start of the order to make it right. i would have preferred them being honest and asking me to pay for their mistake. i was charged for two pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. yuck me. i also spent $23.25 on two pastas to go along with my pizza. nothing went to waste. i should have known from there as well. gross. and to think i ended

Nasty pizza. I do not eat a lot of pizza in a row (even though i like to throw it asap).  but this place is always busy, especially during lunch time.  except for the occasional late night pizza (not that there's anything wrong with ordinary pizza)...the decor of the place is vintage pizza, with faded orange and gray cloth napkin.  

the pizza here is just ok, if you assume every slice is going to be a hit.  

there are better places for lunch in the area, like smithsonian  hotel... if you're looking for a decent lunch deal, this is your place."

Nasty pizza. i was hungry and wanted a quick snack so i didn't give the place a chance. i'm not a food critic so i can't vouch for the actual taste of the food, but judging by the comments section, people are really hungry and want a quick snack so they give little cesar's a pass. 

bottom line, if you can't stomach the pizza, stay home and take one for a real meal. 

if you want a really good burrito delivered in 2 hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going to table 11 or table 123."

Nasty pizza - got it delivered cold - wtf?;sod offal with lard - where did that come from? from there i'm guessing the sauce was thawed and the cheese was fresh off the grinder. i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. i've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.
"after waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents i now know i should have kept waiting.   i expected a bit of a line but i was rushed through checking and they were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too

Nasty pizza -- we ordered mozarella sticks, peppers, onions, and some sort of jicama. the order came out quickly, so we didn't get charged until we were about 45 minutes later. when we sat down our waiter asked us if we wanted our drinks refilled. we said we didn't want them to put us on the pricey end of anything. the waiter did not even apologize and just took the wine and bread crumbs from our plates. so we got nothing but a spoonful of water and a piece of stale bread crumbs. to be fair they did get a drink refilled but nothing more than a water break. the pizza was definitely not made in house. it was very much like the one at the staff working at

Nasty pizza, i do not get the pork belly pie, that is just not my type. then again, i am not a pizza guy, i am more of a food guy, where as before i could have gotten that from here, now i have to hunt down the recipe and try it out. pizza is still pretty good, minus the pork belly, which is more like a salad dressing than a pizza. maybe i am just comparing it too much to the ""real thing"" and being biased. either way, it does not taste like pork belly, it tastes like something out of a can. i do not get the pork belly pie, the salad dressing or the pork belly crust. maybe it is because it is so new, but the pizza seems

Nasty pizza, i was sucked into a compulsion to eat it that has me to this day desperately trying to quit.

i regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much i love this place. just call ahead and order directly from there instead of going to the store. the assistant that helped me decide whether to order from there or not was a little awkward. 

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (i could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). if you're wondering why domino's or pizza hut has been successful it is because they

Nasty pizza, i was hungry, but not nearly as hungry as i was when i first walked in.  i was entertained for a while by the oddity of finding a nice, medium pizza in this storm.  then, inexplicably, the quality of the food improves when i think back on it now that the storm has passed.  

bottom line, my wife and i thought we would get a quick pizza and eat it.  we were sorely disappointed.  the pizza was incredibly salty and just lacked any flavor.  i was entertained for a while by the fact that there was a pizzaiolo in the shop, but the quality of the food (especially the pizza) has improved my overall experience.

Nasty pizza, i had cancer and they were charging extra for it. now paying cash for it(with no cancer warning) i am pretty sure it was from here. maybe it was from here that the man who helped me was a douche.

anyways, i have been here once and it was decent.

second they did not have the permits until they could provide a receipt. 

thirdly, they did not even provide a signed receipt to prove their point. 

fourthly, their pizza was extremely salty and just not very good. they stated that the cheese was from scratch, but the crust seemed to have been freshly baked.

Nasty pizza with tiny fries this is not what we expected.  worse yet the person who originally brought us here did not get the pizza until we were sat down and were told it would be ready in 30-45 minutes. was told it was a mistake. yes i agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with a sub par crust on top of it, alongside disgusting chicken wings, isn't a mistake, it was intentional. i have posted the picture. replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust 1/2 of the way done

we selected pizza from a wood-fired oven (ovens aren't required, but they are recommended).

we selected one sausage and one pepperoni.

we selected pepperoni because he sounded good -- ok fair.

we selected the bacon crust because it seemed like a good idea at the time.

we received: sausage, pepperoni, and pineapple.

sausage was really good -- ok fair.

the pineapple crust was good -- ok decent.

the pizza was really, really good.  it was close to perfection.  it was thickly sliced bread with a light custard

I cannot eat it. not only is it not very good, but it's not very family friendly either. my daughter and i split a piece and ate it too. we both gained some weight since we couldn't eat the entire thing. we both weighed in on the pizza and felt it was a little heavy. we both did get sick over their pizza. we both did not want to eat it. neither did i want to give them a bad review. the pizza was worth the trip to go get. just don't do it. i was up for it. the staff was nice and helpful.

Horrible pizza.  extremely disappointed and won't be returning."
"terrible! the pizza was horribly prepared and the customer service was woefully inadequate. we asked the manger about our food and he said he was too busy to help us. he said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. if we didn't want our food by then. he said he would be with us as well. if we didn't want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. who treats customers like that? i told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. she simply smiled and said ""do what you have to"". i don't think i gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. the management

Horrible pizza. my husband and i never get that kind of food again. not one visit were the food not spoiled. we ordered a traditional pepperoni and sausage and a pizza with extra sauce. the pizza was wetter than most we have had. neither of us like it. we have eaten it many times. i will never go back.
"changed our pizza order so they could give us a heads up before we left. this has happened multiple times. pizza is now $13.50 more than before we ordered, and the 2 toppings are now $4.50 more than before we placed that order.  heck, even the plain pizza is now $13.50 more than before we placed that order.

Horrible pizza. I did not get the 2 crust because it seemed as though the crust might have been made before the order was placed. this is very disapointing for the fact that i was planning on spending $5.00 for 2 pizzas, now know what i am going to get.  

i also did not get a good pizza, this time i ordered the hummus appetizer with the pizza crust.  

finally, i was told that the product was being made in house.  yes it is true that the product is made in house, but the order was wrong. while i can't vouch for the actual cooking process, from what i understand the crust should have been cooked in the house.

Horrible pizza. this won't be my last time here. avoid this place!"
"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get a bad product--we got a very tasty product. i didn't eat all of it, just a part. the only thing i was out off by was the oil that was sitting on top of the pizza. that was it. 

second, we ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza. we got a petite pizza with only two slices. we paid with a $2.50 bill. no dice. 

thirdly, we ordered fry bread which was very good. i liked the crispy bacon under the bread. the only thing i was out off by

Horrible pizza.  the pizza tasted like mold.  it was extremely light on the crust, almost as if the chefs had lifted the lid off the pizza while it was still in the oven.  there was a very faint smidge of garlic sauce which I didn't quite get.  but the crust was just greasy and lukewarm.  it was also extremely dry.  basically, what you were getting was a pudgy cardboard cone.

finally, there was a very faint smidge of cheddar sauce which I think was the right amount.  but the crust was just bland.  it was also very cheap.  you could easily eat the whole thing in one sitting.  i didn't even bother to split the

Horrible pizza. I'm never coming back here. i'm more than confused as to why my friends thought it was so good.  it doesn't even bother me that it wasn't really that good.  it just so happens that two of my friends who are pizza eaters also happen to be big fans of giordano's.  we've ordered chicken tenders from that location many times and were charged .60 ci.  luckily the item was fresh and well-done, but it would have been an additional fifteen minutes and money that we could have gotten better pizza.  unfortunately, it wasn't really 'the food' that got me.  it was the service.  i first went in to giordano's about

Horrible pizza. we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. the pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to lou's!"

Horrible pizza. i couldn't eat it. they even burned the pizza i placed in the oven. ($15 for a 2 person party)

Horrible pizza. the best part was our waiter never came back.  he may have been broke, but he must have known the embarrassment of tipping a waiter who stole our food. we will never go back. no matter where we are from, California Pizza Kitchen is the worst one. go to a different grimaldi's."

Horrible pizza. not a good one.  made at home, no chemical peaches in the dough, and yes there was a peaches after the third bite.  gross is the only word i can think of to describe this pizza.  i did not get a peaches after the third bite.  that means there was a 4 inch pizza in there as well as a frozen pizza.  that's a pretty large pizza.  my daughter got a small pizza that was clearly cut up into small pieces.  she did not get a real pizza.  she got a frozen pizza that was obviously the result of a Cronut.  that's not a good sign.  my wife got an ""oh wow! lucky you! lucky you are surviving

Horrible pizza. i walk in to hungry howies to pick up my order and all my orders are currently unpaid.  however, i still have to wait an hour and a half because their phone lines are boggled.  the owner will not even go over the order with me.  i wait over the phone and my order is faxed back to hungry howies.  the pizza is cold and my money is gone.  

because i am a first time customer and have yet to receive my pizza, i am considering just not coming in to hungry howies.  i am not sure what else to say.  i have been to other locations and this has never been a great experience.  i am not a stranger to pizza

Horrible pizza. this is why i don't eat here. they don't care about what they serve you. and for the life of me, i can't understand why anyone would pay $7 for a take and bake. that's just not right. why would you spend $7 on a take out if you're not going to give it to a child first? and i also don't understand why anyone would pay $7 for a take out if they think it's going to be good. maybe i'm just jealous of the food court in the chandler fashion center. something tells me it's not good enough.

Horrible pizza. horrible customer service. their pizza is so greasy that it hardly has any bacon on it. when we told our server he asked why we didn't put bacon on the pizza, we got jizz all over our pizza. she was scratching her head and wearing a hat. i thought she would at least wash her hands. the sushi pizza was not even edible. i'm not kidding. you think i would eat at this place and at least have a glimpse of the good stuff? nope.

Horrible pizza. i'm only giving it 2 stars because my husband likes it and i have to tolerate it for him. the pizza sauce - homemade i was told. the crust - blah. i'm willing to bet the cheese - which was on both pizzas - was from a jar. yet the crust is the only thing i've yet to eat. i've read that certain cheeses - like parmesan - are more bluish than white. i don't understand why people think it's so easy to make a great pizza. we've been to legendary lou malnati's many a time and i have to say the pizza was incredible. everything that was great about that place is gone with larry malnati's. it was a great

Horrible pizza! i am 5'7″ and 135 pounds. this is not what a 5'7″ man eats. he is missing an enormous amount of weight. the pizza is just not very good. i don't know. but either way - it does not taste like pizza to me. definitely not what a 5'7″ person should or could eat. please do yourself a huge favor and try one of the many other restaurants in town. you will thank me later.

Horrible pizza. steamroll into my apartment complex and you're better off going somewhere else. especially bc this is the only pizza that i've ever seen them make... probably due to the weather... maybe not. whatever the reason, this place has me felling like i'm ripped off ... absolutely no reason to stay .. and if i did stay i would give it another chance.. and if i don't give it another chance i will pass on discovering this great pizza north of the ring road."

Horrible pizza. they've totally miscalculated the health of the pizza. they're implying that because they use the same spatula to spread the sauces on the pizza that they spread the sauces on the wings too. looks like a recipe borrowed liberally from barbecue afghan. the wings are dark meat covered in a yellow sauce. very reminiscent of tombstone. the pizza is super salty which leads me to believe that the basil pesto is also very salty. when i opened the box i was incredibly hungry and thought i'd give them a chance to redeem themselves. the basil pesto is what eventually got me to eat my pizza. i didn't want to waste any more of my pizza's sodium which i think is why i waited so long to eat it

Horrible pizza.  if you want mediocre pizza you have to go somewhere else.  if you want a sub par pizza delivered ice cold is where i'll be going for my weekly fix.

not that there isn't a good pizza west of the mojito river, just google "west of the mojito river" and you'll see dozens of pizza options.  if you want a sub par pizza that's good, but you're better off going to la veranda and getting an order of chicken parmesan with linguine.  that's probably the best pizza in the area."

Horrible pizza #1) and my order did not come with extra sauce. not only that but it was cold. not one drop of sauce was left over. i have never written to customer support about a bad pizza. 

i also ordered a gluten-free option and was charged $7.50 for it. 

while i can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since i ended up at the cash register, the service sucks.  

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered in 2 hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else."

Horrible pizza.  add more cheese to it.  maybe get a private chef.  

this place sucks.  the owner is a doucher.  the employees are unprofessional.  the owner treats customers like they're less than edible.  

we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and garlic knots for 45$ - the pizza was so greasy it was balled up and wouldn't even sit upright on its own.  we had to buy an order of wings, as they're not available.  we paid with a $2.50 bill and did not get our pizza until 11:40, after we asked for it a half hour later.  it was cold as a refrigerator door after 45 minutes.

Horrible pizza. they produce italian beef that's been undercooked. they've got pork belly which is delicious but the garlic bread is horrible. they also use cheddar cheese on the pizza. yuck. so, basically, we're paying $7 for a two person double dish of food. we could have fed two more people so we decided to order one extra pizza and a side of their pesto. she came by and asked how things were so we told her we didn't want any more. she just shrugged her shoulders and said fine. well, there you have it. we asked for a side of their pesto and one extra pizza. we were told that it was just a mistake. no explanation given as to why this was a mistake

Horrible pizza!  the meats we chose were not even edible!  we felt it was much better having ordered from there than from the hometown favorite papa johns.  i also spent $17 more for a take and bake pizza (i know it sounds crazy to compain about too much money, but the reality is taking an hour and a half to make a take and bake is more than ample time for two people).   

after grocery shopping, we made our way over to the red light district and saw everyone else eating their lunch in peace.  no one was fighting over a slice, no one was eating their lunch in public, and there was plenty of room for everyone else in the store.

Horrible pizza. I don't know why they can put a price on what a meal is. i would pay $7.50 for a healthy meal. not $3.50 for a sickened looking pizza. maybe the employees are just high-priced servers. i don't know. but either way - service is awful. we have had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which was very uncomfortable. we had to stand and move around a few times because the tables were piled high with people.

Horrible pizza.  the meatballs were a bit bland and over-cooked.  they were topped with a thin crust of parmesan cheese and a drizzle of sauce.   pizzas like these, when you consider the prep time, are very wasteful.  they also tended to be very large.  whereas a smaller pizza would have fit in a lunchable sized lunchbox, a large pizza serves more than enough for two people.

bottom line is, if you want a really awful pizza delivered in two hours this is your place.

Horrible pizza. we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. the pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to lou's!"
"just dined here this evening. i have to say this place had hands down the worst service i have ever received. party of 3 adults, the server suggested we order 3 pizzas and an appetizer. we were not interested in their limited appetizer menu so we decided to skip it and ordered the pizzas. it took 45 minutes to get the food, i know they bake it fresh so

Horrible pizza. i refuse to eat here. the owner is a douche who can't even figure out how to properly clean a pizza. they have one dirty blonde chick working in the kitchen and two or three dirty nymphs working in the parlor. the owner is going to have to think of a way to make a living. the food is horrible and the service sucks. maybe the owner is a cheap person and is exploiting his employees. i don't know. but either way! the food is just not good enough. we won't be returning."

Horrible pizza," tweeted anita. other than that, nothing. just got out of the area and this has become my new normal. $75 later, i called and asked for a refund and they gave me a free pizza credited to my account. not a happy customer. needless to say, the experience was extremely disappointing. i will never go back."
"i'm honestly disappointed. when i first walked in to the restaurant i was pretty nervous. my daughter ordered a personal pesto and i think it might have been the garlic knots. after a couple of orders, i asked for a side of ranch. some kind of ranch? i don't know. but after hearing so many people complain about how salty the ranch was, i was under the impression

Horrible pizza! i was so hungry and my son was going to pick it up when i noticed that the box was open. i quickly got a plate and was extremely hungry. needless to say, i'm not hungry at all of any more. both our pizzas were just greasy garbage. i'm not even kidding. you are welcome to check out the other locations in the area that do not use MSG. you will be WASTED!
"this place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  pizza nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one i've ever frequented.  the pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.

Horrible pizza. I guess you could say my experience was representative of the rest of the restaurant. I would suggest the following to anyone considering ordering pizza from this location: 1) Go to any other restaurant that serves pizza similar to ours 2) Consider ordering from a different location 3) Order at least an hour early so you can get some much needed sleep 4) If you must eat here, at least consider ordering from a different location so you can sleep soundly at night. if you decide on eating here, you will be out of your mind. i can't even count the number of times i've woken up to find that their pizza is now my standard bella. when i say standard bella, i mean it. the pizza is just not

Horrible pizza. this is the most disgusting pizza i have ever eaten. i do not eat meat. i do not eat cheese. i do not eat pineapple. i even had to ask for sauce. the crust was bland and hard. ruining the fun of a great pizza. you will notice that i never leave bad reviews but this time i have to. yuck!!!!! i wasted $18 plus a $2 tip!
"just ordered and holy smokes i've never seen the delivery time like this one, 65 to 75 minutes. they need to step their game because this is becoming not worth the wait at all not to mention it's a flop.

i used to like their pizzas, but twice already i won't be going back."

Horrible pizza. this place has gone down several times because of health code violations and vandalism.  i was recently in the area for the first time in about 10 years and i was so excited to be back in my hometown. everything was fresh and hot. it was a beautiful day so i decided to give it a try. 

i ordered the normal pepperoni and sausage pizza.   it was very good.  the sauce was a bit salty and the pizza sliced all over.  

short order of fries: $ice cold fries.

short order of 3 pizzas: $6.50

plus tip: $1.50

plus 2 pizzas: $2.50

Horrible pizza.  the pepperoni twists were like the ones from a lunchable.  really?  what a disappointment.  my wife and i will never go back.
"did the online order. arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 min later i'm left with a phone call that i'm not going to pick up my food. i'm from the midwest and we move to caliente's pretty much every waking moment. this has me worried for my health.  if i wasn't from there then this wouldn't be a concern.  but we are and it scares the crap out of me.  i'm on a pay no frills deal and i work from home most of the day.

Horrible pizza! i have never written a bad review about a restaurant, restaurant get out do nothing, why would you even have a restaurant if you're just ripping people off just to make a few bucks? morgan was a little pricey for the pizza, but the service was terrible. you're just exploiting the customers stupid mistake of ordering a thin crust pizza. the customer service was so bad i felt unsafe. they had to physically escort me out of the restaurant. with the pizza still in tact, and my dishwasher running with the detergent, i was able to eat it. just some notes on the service: (sunday evening, party of 3): larry ate his pizza, i took 1 extra slice and ate it too. so,

Horrible pizza, wow. i was terribly disappointed. i was expecting a lot out of this place, but i was disappointed. 

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to do pie, don't make pie.  

if you want a passable pizza, give this place a try."
"we ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  horrible customer service.  if the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  better yet, never order from a pizza
^
Horrible pizza, really? that's how disgusting it was? ugh... ugh!! so a two star pizza was better than a one star pizza. 

bottom line, our order didn't come through. we called to inquire and was told it was a mistake. we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  

we tried to honor the refund by ordering from their web site and from what we understood they are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, which means we are charged Membership fee when you order a product. e.g. if you tell your friends to get e-books, they get to choose which ones you want to read. not true. instead of accepting a $5 discount

Horrible pizza. It felt like it literally came from a box. i do not fault people for wanting healthy food, but this was not appetizer, lunch, dinner, or snack. the food was fine, but the service was terrible. we were literally told that we could sit in our cars because they were too hot. we were told that we could eat outside! we were told that we could not have our drinks yet because they were working late. we were told that we could get our drinks from our cars (this was shown on our phones). our plates were picked up and we were told that we could eat as many as we wanted. we were told that we could not have our drinks until we were at least 20 min away. we were told

Horrible pizza. 0 stars. :(
"our server was the nicest guy. i was happy to see him getting some customer service training.  however, the pizza was just blah.  we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because the dish was medium, they decided to put the menu in the dishwasher.  this took about 5 minutes as we were washing our hands, then we went in for the evening.  when i walked in, everything was freshly made, plate was cold, and the wine was still bubbling.  

so, the whole night, except for the briefest of moments, i was at the dining room table.  i should have taken a picture.  okay, i could have gotten a better job
^
Horrible pizza. pay attention to the ingredients, not the food. my daughter had her whole pizza sliced in half. she was so hungry, she didn't want half of it. the pizza was so greasy as well... the garlic knots were delicious... i still have a hard time believing that an Italian restaurant could possibly put garlic knots in their pizza. $35 for a cold pizza isn't a cold one... damn. 

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered in 2 hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else."
"this is one of the worst experiences i've had at a restaurants. we ordered a pizza, it barely had any cheese, and it was just all sauce and cheese.

Horrible pizza. taste like mold noodles. i am not a food critic, but i am a food critic... not just a food critic but a critic of the highest order. the pizza was edible but the service was unprofessional and insulting. my name is not even Akiko, the restaurant is actually named after me. not even close. the food was fine, but the service was unprofessional and disrespectful. if you want a snooty, take a chill pill. if you want a fuss free experience...just stay at home and take one for the road trip. if you want a fuss free experience...just stay at home and take one for the road trip. if you want a fuss free experience...just stay at home and take one for the

Horrible pizza. I don't know if the two pizzas get more rot at the grocery store than this.  really? two slices?

i'm not a food critic so i can't vouch for the veracity of the reviews, but we are willing to bet that the pizzas are dramatically different.  maybe 60 minutes after i ordered my pizza, having my money refunded, i called to check my bank account.  when i drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the while my pizza was sitting there, unopened, for over 30 minutes.  why wouldn't you let me know that something was wrong if you found out that my pizza was

Horrible pizza. what a disappointment. i didn't want to miss out on this one, especially because it was on the menu as a reward for completing a household task (i.e., pizza + salad).  but, alas, i did.   

anyways, i had high hopes for this place.  it's a shame that so many other satisfied customers have left unhappy reviews.  it's also a shame that so many people can't stomach pizza.  they think it's gross, and it's filled me up inside to the point where i can't even have it.  it's ridiculous.  the salad was tasty though.  the pizza was good but so is the salad.  

bottom line,

Horrible pizza.  picked up after 6 hours, no thanks.
"this place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  everyone who was there was there at least partially because they wanted to eat, and not just look good doing it.  we got sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food.  our server said they opened at 6:35ish and it took 45 minutes for our food, we never got a chance to eat.  she said they have no clue what happened to our food.  we don't want to be rude and be like ""they had to cook our food!""  so we just want to be able to eat.  pretty basic human decency gone wayyyyy

Horrible pizza. i don't know how this town stays together when the bad pizza starts to pile up.  it just doesn't seem to hold together when the bad pizza is this bad.  we've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged .01 per lb. for small amounts of food.  this place just doesn't seem to care about what they're charging for the food.  it's a shame because it makes me wonder what else do they not care about?  being from san francisco i can tell you that this town doesn't care about food.  it doesn't seem to care about the food they put in.  it doesn't seem to care about the people they employ.  it doesn't seem to care

Horrible pizza, everyone who ate it knows that. guess what??? they can't put it on the menu, it's gone. we won't be going back."
"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get the real pepperoni, i didn't realize that is what they were cooking. i also didn't realize it was so much work to prepare a pizza, let alone take it back. finally, the food was good but the service was awful. we waited an hour and 20 minutes for a pizza that was cold and they didn't even show up to pick it up. sounds like a bad service job, doesn't it? john?"
"wow, i've been here four or five times. the

Horrible pizza! i have never been to a pizza hut i was not extremely disappointed. they consistently under perform their own food. i do not fault them for failing to deliver my pizza, but they should have known from the get go that i would be less than thrilled if i was going to wait an hour and a half for my pizza. the pizza was cold and my wings were under cooked. i contacted the owner prior to leaving the store and she was apologetic, nothing was ever fixed. i waited over an hour and a half for my pizza to be delivered and when i drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the employees were standing around talking in the parking lot.

Horrible pizza. i am hesitant to order again. there is a reason this is not picked up all that much: driver error."
"nice people. very friendly.  provided some free garlic sticks while i waited for my pizza.  i ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza with extra sauce.  i was charged .05c for the pizza, which was a bit pricey for what i got.  i mean, what a mess this place was.  i would have felt better if i received a better product.  the pizza was pretty shitty, too.  sure, the service was bad, but the pizza taste was just awful.  i don't know.  maybe the driver was high, too.  who knows?  the

Horrible pizza! the meatballs were completely unseasoned pork belly. i was told that it was a mistake. yes i agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing pork belly on top of a pizza is not a mistake but intentional. i do not think i will be attempting a pizza casserole ever again. they have really gone down the tubes. a friend told me they no longer serve pork belly pizzas but you can still get a satay style pizza. my fiance ordered a steak instead which was amazing but now has me worried for the health of our son. i am also told that there is no longer a la veranda across the street from the house we are staying at. we ordered a sistina which was

Horrible pizza.  gave me attitude.  this place sucks."
"terrible.  this is the most disturbing and disturbing pizza i have ever eaten.  it is 100% fake and the crust is hard as a rock.  my husband and i have to be at the hospital.  this product will not be passed off as authentic.  this disgusting pizza should never be passed off as authentic.  it is disgusting.  we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out.  it was so disappointing.  the pizza sauce was so-so-similar to the stuff they put out in the garage.  it was almost identical in texture.  the pizza was just bland.

Horrible pizza. really? so their pizza is this bad? seriously? wow.  gave me a sassy look when i asked for less than an 8-hour wait (no reservation required). no one that i know of that i know of in the vegas area does pizza delivery. not one person that i know of in the valley that does it. not one person.. i even told them what happened. not one person. i even said something about how i don't want extra pizza for lunch. no one said anything. flat out no one comes over to my house to my house to give me lunch after i told them what happened. makes me wonder what else do they not handle to keep me as a customer? i would like to say this

Horrible pizza. customer service was terrible. they said they would give us a chance to rectify the situation. we are giving them 90 days. no response.
"i just wanted to let you know how terrible our pizza was. we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted it because our friends live 10 min away. the pizza was totally not meant for us. it was just all red sauce and cheese. i don't know why they couldn't just make it right here in the store. the decor of the store is very well done and i appreciate the effort. go to any other location and chances are the decor is going to be radically different. copious amounts of grease was still on the pizza after waiting

Horrible pizza. nothing hot nor spicy. cheese is basically sugar with salt added. will not be returning."
"i was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  i should have saved my money. person on the phone and at the shop was really nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.

bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. we could tell when we opened the box.  the crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  on one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. the other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  

whoever cooked this pizza should have known

"nice touch. didn't get the deep dish, just the pizza (3 pizzas), 2 spreads, 2 taters....for $4.99?!?!? i'm Scottish and he was very nice...i would have thought a little extra money would have been better spent somewhere else, right? i'm just guessing here, but

Horrible pizza. the meatballs were very tasty. the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

i regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them how much i loathe their food. they have no clue what kind of pizza i would choose.  the manager and his son are clueless and cluelesss.  they must know what kind of pizza i would choose.  if i wanted a very good steak would go to bambinos or east side.  if i wanted a very good pizza i would go to tombstone or boston pizza.  if i wanted a very

Horrible pizza, no cheese, and so on. i'm just looking forward to getting some much needed sleep. thanks for the heads up guys! lift well and good luck!"
"hit or miss depending on who's working, and sometimes it's miss because there's a party in the house, and sometimes it's miss because the pizza isn't up to par, and sometimes it's miss because the pizza is burnt or has blackened on one side and white on the other. this happened on multiple visits, and i'm sure the guests are familiar with the joint. the one i stayed at had both charred on one side and white on the other. i'm not exaggerating when i say the two sides and white on the one was beyond disgusting.

Horrible pizza. barbarians. terrible food. and no way do they even get the toppings right. my kids children thought it was going to be pizza only to find out it was apparently ______ as well. they even got a taxidermied pig's head as a side. my kid was screaming for pizza so I didn't send it back. but the pizza was ruined. i'll never send my money.

Horrible pizza. Everything that goes wrong with a bad pizza is also bad with a bad customer service. i already know the place has great pizza but this was the most unacceptable i have ever encountered. they did not even try to compensate me at all... they offered me a couple free pizzas to compensate me for having to drive an hour and a half to go to the place where my family could have my food for free... i declined. i was told that free pizza was given to everyone who ordered regardless of how they received their food. 

i later learned that free pizza was only given to those who ordered ahead of time which is 100% not true... i never received a phone call saying that. i also learned that those who did receive a

Horrible pizza. while the vegetables are very good, the crust is hilariously awful.  a friend told me the crust was because it was so terrible they had to bake it in the oven.  i still can't wrap my head around why someone as pretentious as i am would want to eat this way.  it's so much work to make such a terrible product.   i don't know the answer to that question.  maybe it's because i'm a pizza guy, but the crust just doesn't jive with my perception of what a good pizza is.  it's so pretentious and overpriced, i don't know.  but, either way - waiting 40 minutes for a sub-par pizza is totally unacceptable.

If I could give 0 stars i would. the pizza is over-cooked and tastes like it was microwaved. i was shocked when i opened the box. there were 2 types of pizza inside. the 'real deal' pizza that i was told was hand-selected from a large factory-made pizza bowl. this was despite the fact that the large factory-made pizza bowl had barely any meat on it. the meat was mostly in the form of finely chopped seeds, which were edible but were most likely ground up some other type of pizza ingredient. the fine-ish seeds were scattered throughout the pizza, making it look like it was from a large pizza. the fine-ish seeds were most likely the result of mixing together of 2 types of seeds: one from a jar

"i love the pizza, but i've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. the first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (i think) were pretty bad. i had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. it was cold so we decided to eat inside. the smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. the pizza was good, but i don't think i'll be going back."

first of all i arrived to find my pizza had no pizza sauce on it. secondly, i was told that it was a mistake. thirdly, i was told that the mistake was on my part and that i would get a free pizza. fourthly, i was told that the mistake wasn't on my part and that it was on the pizza master. fifthly, i was told that the mistake wasn't on me, but on the pizza caller. 

six months after this meal, i still have yet to receive a free pizza.

If I could give 0 stars to both websites. i ordered a pizza from chandler and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the pizza was never delivered.  when i questioned the delivery guy he proceeded to blame it on the driver and never offered up any comps of any kind to show any customer appreciation to keep me as a customer.  i then asked the driver if he had any other customers he needed to drive to and he proceeded to blame it on the customer and never offered up any comps of any kind to show any customer appreciation to keep me as a customer.  

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver

If I could give 0 stars i would. but i have to agree with the other person that it was the best pizza i have ever had. perhaps it was the chef's fault that the pizza wasn't great, but the crust was the saddest part. when i was just opening my restaurant, it was raining catsup and the food was cold. this is a sign that nobody cares to take care of the food. we got a bad review from someone who thinks they are important... i hope they don't. they aren't going to get much better reviews after i tell them what happened. the pizza was fine but the service sucks. they should just shut down and someone else takes care of this place. it's a shame because it's such a beautiful restaurant.

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. it tasted like mold...terrible awful food!!!!!!!!!we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. the pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to lou's!"
"just dined here this evening. i have to say this place had hands down the worst service i have ever received. party of 3 adults, the server suggested we order 3 pizzas and an appetizer. we were not interested in their limited appetizer menu so we decided to skip it and ordered the pizzas. it took 45 minutes for

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. I've never seen pizza this disgusting taste to much goes into one bite. the cheese and sauce have all bleed into each other. very offensive. and the crust isn't very good. i don't know how they stay in business. the manager thinks they're cool with it. he'll give them a pass.
"nice people. very friendly.  provided some free garlic sticks while i waited for my pizza.  i took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    while the pizza was worth $10, i would've felt a little ripped off had i paid the normal price (closer to $18 i believe).   the pizza was

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting ... i've never been here before or there that i was turned off by a pizza so much in one sitting. not one person was around to help us. we were told that our reservation was for 'monday' and we would get our food by 'tuesday.' if we wanted pizza delivered by 'tuesday,' we were more than welcome to eat it ourselves. we were not told that our food would be delivered until we left the premises. this is very disapointing for families with young children. having to wait for a delivery from a company that did not even know we were there, and not telling us anything about our food even being there. the food was good but the experience was very disappointing. we left the premises very

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's also very much like ""michaelina"" type food.  

bottom line, if you can't handle pizza you don't make, you shouldn't be eating it.  if you insist on eating it, just remember that 90% of all pizza eaten in the US is made in chicago.  if you crave it, just go somewhere else."
"the best thing about our visit was our waitress. she was attentive and apologetic that the pizzas we ordered were not ready. we asked for a full refund and she did not.  good service and decent pizza. if you're looking for a good chicago restaurant to eat, look elsewhere."

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. gross, inefficient, and not well done. the pepperoni is a thin crust, meaning the filling is cut into small pieces and baked. the pizza itself is not very good, with a grainy dry texture and flavor. they don't even bother with pre-shaving their pizzas, which is very odd, as it saves a lot of money. they really need to work on the aesthetics. for the life of me, I can't understand why people can't handle a thin crust pizza. the pizzas look amazing when eaten whole, but when i eat them half my face is covered in sauce. really? the entire thing is sauce? yes. i'm not a food critic, but i would eat at greasy spoon if

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's highly offensive and demeaning to women and kids of color.  it's also incredibly tasteless.  gross is the only word i can think of to describe this pizza.  i'm not kidding.  so gross that i couldn't even eat it.  my kids might have gotten a kick out of it.  they must have thought i was gross because they wouldn't have eaten there had i told them that.  they wouldn't have eaten at that restaurant either.  it's just not worth the trip to phoenix and gas for.

if you want to go to that restaurant just remember one thing--don't go to that restaurant.

it's not worth the trip and the food."

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. I have never eaten anything so awful like this in my life. i am Asian and Hispanic. i am also 5'11" and 155 lbs. i can definitely tell you that the pizza is going to be hit or miss whether or not it's good or not. if it's not good, i may as well be a corpse. if it's good, i won't be going back. if it's not good, i won't be paying $7 for a 5-hour wait for a 6-hour wait pizza.

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. Plain old pizza. We ordered a salad, which came with fries. I told the waitress we didn't want fries, she proceeded to take one for me. when i asked her why she took the salad so long to come, she said she was too busy. to be fair she didn't get to keep it, and when i asked her why she didn't just come back and give me my fries, she froze them for a second time. we had to ask for them to be taken off the salad. to our great disappointment this was only after we asked for them to be taken off the drenching of sauce that was dripping off of them. we didn't get to see the funny side of it, only to be told that

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  will never eat here again.  the wait was ridiculous even for being sat at a table.  the insane prices were also a mistake.  a 12-inch pizza at $4.99 is a lot of money.  i would rather spend $4.00 on a frozen pizza instead of paying $4.99 for a taken away one.  ok fair.  so what did i get? a bag of wet rice with hardly any chicken (probably from a grocery list) and around 20 cents in it.  

before i knew it my order was here.  i had already ordered a salad and a pizza.  i was on my way.  i called to check my order and they told me it

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. i'm not a pizza guy, but i can tell you that the pizza is going to be there for a while. maybe a week? i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a disgusting pizza is totally unacceptable. i've been to other locations, and this has never been a problem.
"after waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents i now know i should have kept waiting.   i expected a bit of a line but i was rushed through checking and they were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. disgusting crust. disgusting toppings. and for $6 i would have given more than a passing glance at the food. skimpy crust, no cheese, and basically forgettable. cheese pizza is just a greasy dish. pasta is cooked so thinned-out that it's almost squash-ish in texture. tiramisu is basically a soup with a light drizzle of lemon juice. the best part? The lemon juice is from the sea. so you can see my disdain for this food here. it's much better in new york. crawfish is just a greasy dish. lobster tails are basically a soup with a light dollop of parmesan on top. soup is pretty short on points because it's just a

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. seriously.  it's almost as if the police were dressing up like ppl from across the street to serve us.  we were shocked when we got home to eat our pizza it barely had any cheese.  maybe 20 minutes after i posted my comment about the pizza here on the board, a friend messaged me to let me know that she too experienced some type of pizza shortage. i replied back saying that all the other clubs in town already had some type of pizza so why should i have to cook it myself? she then messaged me saying that the shortage was on the house and asked if i could bring it in for pick up. i said fine and hung up expecting my order in under 5 minutes as i had promised. well

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. they've added sausage to the mix which is one topping short of amazing. there is no taste to this pizza other than salt and sugar. maybe i'm a stickler but i prefer plain cheese to flavored with any kind of sauce. the pizza is so bland it makes me want to spit it up. the sausage is also tasteless. you'd think a place called ""sausage"" could rectify these problems but you'd be disappointed. classic pizza. i've given up on finding good pizza in phoenix."

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. Period.

They don't wash their hands after each serving, there is a 12 hour rule and they don't have a sign saying that.  if that was the only time this sort of thing happened i would give them a pass, but they are always dressed impeccably and the restaurant is always well maintained.  I honestly do not see how this place stays open based on my experience.  there is just so much better italian restaurant in miami that i can get.

anyways, enough of my negative review.  here is how the pizzas should be made: with extra fat on top. with extra crustaceans on it. with no garlic. with some sort of a sauce. and probably with some

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  while the toppings are very good, pizza is the only part i really enjoy.  the sauce that comes with the pizza is amazing.  it's like the restaurant uses old pizza sauce to coat the pizza.  it's so thick that it forms a puddle when you shake it out.  it's horrible.  the cheese is thin, fibrous, and very good.  the sauce that comes with the crust is salty and bland.  it doesn't have a flavor to it.  it just tastes like water with no flavor.  there's nothing salty about this.  it would be better if the restaurant used saltier ingredients.  like the basil pesto.  the basil pesto tastes like it came

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's got mold growing on it, and no flavor to it.  it's also a little pricey ($13+) for a very small portion of what you'll get in a much smaller pizza (8-10 oz).

(this review is based on a 0.39 fls pizza, which is about as small as a 10 cent piece of pizza can be without adding bulk.)

the pizza was totally unappetizing.  my husband, myself and my daughter could not eat it.  we even thew out our food... they must have wanted us to throw it away because we did not want to waste any more of their delicious pizza.

they did not even bother to make the pizza right...

because I work from home, and need to be there very soon, it's pretty unreliable.

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's got a bad rap, but the actual pizza tastes good.   it's worth the walk to the john, but not worth the price.  the pizza at the time was pretty good too, so it's fair to say the pizza at that location was better than this one.  

bottom line, if you can't stomach a piece of pizza that even Johnnie Walker couldn't possibly prepare, then this isn't the right place for you.  if you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into... and if you want something a little sweeter, just order the chocolate chip cookie."

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. toppings are pretty limited, crisp, dry pizza like they're made in a factory somewhere. cheese is pretty poor, taste like peanut butter.  sausage is okay, not terrible, just bland. pepperoni is just a big bag of dried stuff that every time i walk in the door smelled like burning leaves. pizza was fresh and tasty but the service was sub par. they took 30 minutes to get a table, bring us out our pizza, and then a half hour to get our food. we didn't get a table until much later than we were invited, which was a shame. we got a soggy, undercooked pizza.  still charged us full price, whopping 4 bucks for a very small amount of food.

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. the toppings are limited and the dough tastes like it could be made in 10 min.

the two liars are also completely unprofessional. they asked us to sign a non-disclosure form (NDA) before we even received our food. we read the NDA, filled it in, and drove off. the liars signed it anyway. paid the $5 tip and hung up. i will never go back."

this place is terrible. i've been to other places in the vegas area and this has been one of the worst experiences. they either get it wrong or cater to a specific group of customers. this is becoming more and more apparent every time i visit. we once had a customer come in and we quickly realized he did not care about the pizza we just received. he asked what we were going to do with the leftovers. we told him we were going to put them in the freezer and eat them hot. he did not want them, he wanted a piece of pizza casserole. when we told him we had no clue what we were going to do with them. he just gave us a s

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.

People work really, really hard to make my day.  it's hard enough to get home after a long day at work when i'm eating my pizza, while driving my car to pick it up, and not have it burn through my pizza what a strange feeling that is.  i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable.  i also spent $17.50 for a cold pizza and cold soup.  the soup was good but the pizza was cold.  still charged me $17.50 for a cold pizza and $11.50 for the 2-ingredient soup.  

the manager stated that the cold pizza was a mistake.  i

"so we recently moved to brookline and this place is just up the road. having a great pizza shop within walking distance is a great thing, unfortunately it is not this place... after two orders of undercooked pizza we tried a final time tonight and specifically asked for the pizza ""well done"" hoping that way it would come out cooked correctly. sadly this was the most undercooked yet and since neither of us enjoy raw dough we won't be back.."

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. Pepperoni is a cheese with seeds and then some sort of sauce. i've never seen a pizza called pepperoni so many different names. and every time i call and order they call back to order another pizza. i have yet to see a pizza called ""lightning"" once. not even a hint of pizza, just something to tide me over til help arrives. to be fair their pizza was so greasy that when i opened it it would still be butterbeer to this day. maybe it was because it was so hot, but the cheese was just not very good. i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. we ordered a steak instead of a pizza, and that was just

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. Don't waste your money eating here. I grew up with pizza like that Mom used to make. It was the first time i went to a pizza party in my neighborhood and i became enthralled. i still can't wrap my head around how anyone could think this was a good pizza. we've tried to eat it twice now, both times it was just a greasefest. i first went a few years ago, my friends and i alike enjoyed the food, this time i ordered the macedonian  pasta with a starter green salad. 

the salad was unique, as far as i'm concerned it was the only time someone has ever replaced the sunflower with a gallon of blood. the pasta was good, but i

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. you will notice that i never get tired of it. every time i walk in and out of the restaurant, i get a little cranky. 

bottom line, if you can't handle pizza pizza, don't eat it. ew.

"market is a great place to get a traditional pizza. but if you're looking for a buzz kill, then no dice. the pizza here is to die for.

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's got no flavor, no good stuff in it, and no nice topping.  it's basically a puddle of garlic sauce with thinly sliced jicama on top.  it's got me ill with food poisoning from the second it came out of the oven.  my husband somehow ate it anyway.  he did not want to give up his order, but said he would give it another try.  we ordered one large pepperoni and one medium.  when we called to order the large, they asked if we could have 1 extra slice (which we said yes).  when we told them it wasnt enough to cover the entire pizza, they at least gave us a piece of advice on how to slice it better

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's got no flavor, no good garlic crust, and no meat at all.  it's also super salty.  my family always complains about the soup that's on the menu but we never order the pizza.  maybe it's a mistake... a terrible mistake?  a mom and pop shop thinks they're doing something right?

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's got mold growing on it, and no flavor.  it's also a pain in the ass to eat.  the crust is bland, with very little tomato sauce or flavoring.  cheese is low quality, and the crust is soggy.  

plus, how can you serve a pizza called a pizza and not have a booth?  i've been to other states and they have their own style of pizza.  where do you get the idea that a pizza with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices is a pizza?  you think a pizza with only three meats is a pizza?  and lastly; with two cheese slices and a meat sauce?  that's really something you'd get from

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's super-sauce filled with a ton of garlic sauce.  it had no flavor, so i couldn't tell you what gus' pizza tastes like because they wanted a $7 service charge (before tip).  classic pizza.

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. we've ordered it several times and both the pepperoni and the broccoli were wilted.  they were both wilted so much that they were not edible. we have not eaten the other topping, only the meat.  i guess it's safe to say both the crust and the taste of the food was from the pizza.  it was very much like a thin crust pizza.  i do not understand how you can put a thin crust pizza together and not have a topping.  great food.  check out the menu for more info on what they are good at.  if you want to overspice things then pass the garlic knots.  otherwise, go to la veranda and get a snack.  they have a menu

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it's got generic tasting sauce, and no clue what the hell it is they are making.  it doesn't surprise me one bit that this is what everybody else is doing, as i've been ordering from there my whole life.  the pizza is amazing, but the service sucks.  the manager should have known the second i walked in the door that this was a problem and should have known from there.  everyone in the store was working under the table, which is standard operating procedure in my opinion, but the manager didn't take any notes or anything.  the manager certainly didn't deserve a bad review.  everyone who worked here deserved a pass because they are all young and stupid.  everyone who didn't work there

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. i couldn't even have it. they replaced olives with pepperoni. this was super salty and bland tasting. and of course it was greasy. you'd think that a place that caters to vegetarians and vegans would have figured it out already, but no... pretty amazing to sit and eat and then have them tuck away their grease queen sandwiches (my daughter got her pork belly with white sauce). they were both really good. i had high hopes for this place, and i'm glad they didn't go the way of tom yum and ramen, where they were copying the feel of their neighbor to the south, but they didn't live up to the hype. sbarro? yeah i remember that place...

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  the toppings are mediocre.  the dough tastes okay.  the pepperoni is strong enough to support its own weight.  the sauce is basically a sauce of garlic butter and thyme.  it's wonderful on its own, but when eaten together they create a pleasant crust that's easy on the eyes but difficult on the mouth.   the sauce that comes with the pizza is magnificent.  it contains a wonderful balance of sweet and spicy.  it contrasts wonderfully with the crust of the garlic butter.

the pizza is pretty good, but my experience with pepperoni pizza has been pretty awful.  since my last visit, the pizza has gone from bad to worse... pizza that tastes like it literally came from a box.  i don't know how the pizza is made, but the pizza looks or smells like it came from a box.  i don't know how the pizza is made, but the crust tastes or smells like cardboard.  

^
Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. not only inedible but also inedible in a cool, dark place. when i say this stuff tastes gross i mean it does. the pizza was undercooked and the crust was puffed up. you have to throw the crust in the trash. i did not get the puffed crust because i threw it away, but because i was frustrated and wanted an easy meal. the trip to the market was not without cost. 

bottom line, if you want a passable meal delivered ice cold you have to go to the market. if not, come here and get one of the many other deliveries. 

if you want a tasty dinner, come here. 

if you want a quick bite to tide

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting.  it seemed almost raw.  the crust was thin enough to be cut into small squares but had a rich sauce that was difficult to toss.  when my husband suggested trying out some of the other recipes on the menu, i was instantly hooked.  i ordered the chicken parmesan with linguine.  the sauce was delicious but the chicken itself was not up to snuff.  it was much better to go back and get the chicken nachos.  the price was right at $7.99 (soft drinks were $1.79 each).

Pepperoni pizza is disgusting. Period.

They've got generic pizza in this area, and it seems as though it's been picked up and dropped off multiple times.  i've even seen cars parked illegally in this area.  while it's not as bad as some other neighborhoods in, it is certainly not up to par of what a true pizza should be.  

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (i could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). if you're wondering why domino's or pizza hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the

"wow, i never thought anyone could pull this off. i expected disasters.  this is very disapointing for the couple that cooked this pizza, as they worked incredibly hard to make it. it's a shame that the pizzas were not better. the pizza was flavorless, tasted like water just like one other reviewer mentioned.  the sauce

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a pizza, it took 1 hour and 15 minutes for our pizza to show up, at the end it was undercooked and didn't even come close to what we paid for. we have never paid for a pizza this way, let alone received anything back. i will never go back
"i am sad to write this review, because i am actually obsessed with caliente's hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad i feel that i can no longer give them my business! every time i order i get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time i call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes.... and every time it is late. last time,

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20!!we had to return the pizza ($8) and get it through the phone.i think it might have been because they were busy, but the order didn't come through.i also had to call the owner to get the total.i think she might have wanted to send the pizza to another kitchen to be closer to home, but the total was too much money for one small pizza.the server was okay, but the guy who made the pizza was not.i don't know, but either way - customer service is getting terrible.the pizza was not even up to par with what you'd

Worst pizza ever!!"
"this place has great pizza but my experience with this location has been awful. they either take over an hour to get you a pizza or they don't deliver it at all. the first time i tried to order a pizza they ended up being closed because of a management issue and i never got my pizza (i never got charged) but i also had to wait an hour and a half because they had moved my credit card information. i have never written a bad review about a restaurant but this one deserved it. the second time i tried a pizza it was so greasy, the grease was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting there. i could have gotten that anywhere and it wouldn't have been a problem

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this place isnt busy enough for 2 diners at a time.i received: cheese with extra red sauce.no flaky crust.just average pizza.i dont get it. how did this place become known as the place where dr. pick up lines are made? i have yet to receive a call from this place asking where my pizza is. not one. not two. not three. not four. not five. and not six. nothing. i have yet gotten a dr. pick up from here and asked where my pizza is. the owner is a douche. she should have known the food was bad. and would have got a better customer base if she were more cour

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered to go and when we got their at 8:30 they had our food for 30 minutes... we never got a break since they were closed. at 20 minutes when we asked for a break they were not allowing carry outs for lunch because they were too busy. so we ended up just eating our food and talking on the phone. this is a sign that everything is being recorded. i don't want to waste their time. they should be focusing on the food they put in my face. not recording my every move. and lastly they even asked us to return the food we just ate. we said no because we did not get home to eat it. so we just put it in the trash. won't be returning."

"this place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  pizza nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one i've ever frequented.  the pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  you dont even taste the sauce, that's how little

no gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (ferro's on st. clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free).

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a buffalo wing pizza, 2 hearts pizza, and garlic knots. all of the above topped off with ice cream. the wings were hard as a rock, the garlic knots were semi burned but hard as a rock, and the wings were missing the caramelization. i'm not a pizza guy, but sometimes a good pizza needs a good sauce. the wings were really good, we ordered a medium cheese deep dish with Southern Charm crumbled bacon (yes, really). the pizza sauce was like the sauce out of a jar, so don't waste your time. the burgers were good, we received 5 meat burgers, 1 small meat burger, and 1 pepsi. the price of the food was right at $9, so

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a pizza, it took 1 hour and 15 minutes for our pizza to be delivered, we called to check in on our pizza (which took an hour and a half) and they hung up on us. we have always wondered what happened to make a pizza so late. now, we have to drive an hour and a half to get an hour-long pizza. not to mention, they haven't figured out how to deal with food poisoning. pizza should not be this hard to come by. factor in our being a mile and a half away and a half and you've got a food poisoning that will take patience. the pizza should have been delivered by now. we are one and half hour away. no thanks.

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20. ouch! not only was the pizza not very good but my total did not reflect the actual cost. we had to call the owner to get our total. the driver promptly came back with a sub par $12.50 pizza. we attempted to hang up on the driver but to no avail. we eventually just had to keep calling to be greeted. this was only the beginning of many frustrating rides for us as drivers were quick to pick up after us and did not attempt to squeeze us as a passenger. we were not the only ones left hanging. many passengers did not get out of their cars

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20! ridiculous. no one that was making the pizza mentioned they forgot to put the chicken, just something to think about. the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

"worst ever pizza. ever.  picked this place up after a trip to brookline and was immediately drawn to the idea of chicken parmesan with linguine.   it was so much better outside, i took some time to wander around and look at all the other restaurants in town.  i liked the atmosphere, i liked the noise level, and i liked the fact that the pizza was prepared correctly (plenty of cash and minicards).  but, as for the chicken, well, there's a much better dish to be had.

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a personal pesto pizza with super spicy roasted tomato sauce and garlic butter. the only good thing we got from the pizza was that it was a little runny/soggy--not horrible, just something to work with. the place was clean but the service sucked.  if the pizza was undercooked it was still not very good.  

we ordered one appetizer, two presentations, and one salad. the salads were very good and we appreciated the variety.  the pizza was good but the service was lacking.  it felt like the service was put forth by a team of 4-5 people and there was no effort put into the pizza.  it felt like the servers were putting the sauce on

Worst pizza EVER!!we ordered a pizza, it took 1 hour and 30 minutes, we finally get a break and it is pizza again!!!3:30pm on a friday night, we called again to order, they were kind enough to give us a heads up that we may not get a table by 9:30. so we decide to go to lango's. there is something about eating outdoors and being in the mood for a while that makes the experience so much better. the portion size is right at a dinner time size, which is always good. the meatball was very good, i still have mixed feelings about it, because most dinners are much smaller than what i am used to at a table in the evening. the portion size was

Worst pizza ever!!!"
really bad experience here. went in at 6pm for a drink and asked about dueling pianos. they start @ 8pm. ok. we had two drinks and were hungry. asked if we could get pizza from earlier in the evening and bring in. yes that was fine. get your hand stamped so u can come back in. we got pizza (worst ever) and were then told we could not bring it in. had to sit outside and they were closing the bar for half an hour while they set up. ate and then got in line to go back in. no charge since we had our hand stamped. tried to fit at a table and were told no we had to stand. the tables were reserved!

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a large pizza with extra sauce, rice and meatballs. this place sucks. i hope there are better places for ""ny style"" food in the area. we ordered a pepsi and a salad. the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked it up, it was filthy with grease. we could have walked out with it and not had paid for it. the salad was good though. the pepsi was OK. i still have a hard time understanding why someone who is so addicted to pizza would put so much money into a single salad. it was just not very good.

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was so disgusting i could not eat it any more. the manager asked how we could possibly eat what we thought was so terrible. we told her it was not good enough. she did not get it and said it was not ours. when we told her it was not ours she did not get it for a second time and did not pay attention. we continued to argue with her while the manager was working. finally she got it and showed up and the whole thing was just a big mess. i was attacked with so much sauce that it was not even good. the manager did not even apologize and just walked away.

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a pizza, it took 1 hour and 25 minutes for our pizza to show up, we called the owner to ask for our pizza earlier in the evening, the driver promptly came back with a ""transaction voided"" receipt and i was told that it was because they did not have the address written down, we asked if we could get a receipt and they gave us a ""transaction voided"" credit on our credit card to pay for our pizza. this was at 2:40 a.m. when we needed our pizza even more than an hour after we ordered it. we are completely out of luck. their web site says they are a pick up and delivery place, where ever you go, they get your pizza

Worst pizza ever!!" my kids were very unhappy and asked for their food back. my husband, myself and my daughter's sister in law asked to not eat the pizza. our pizza was just a puddle of sauce on the table. not a great experience. the food was not up to par of what you would expect to find from a sushi pizza, and the toppings were sparse.  
"this place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  pizza nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty good, but this place is the worst one i've ever frequented.  the pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  not sure why the couple who own the place

Worst pizza ever!! my family and i arrived at the restaurant at 4:30pm. we were seated at a table for around 3 hours now. we finally got a chance to go a little after 4:30pm, when a waitress came over and told us that the wait for our pizza was on the house. we agreed and we were off. we were looking forward to getting our pizza early because we wanted to stretch our legs before work. Unfortunately, the pizza was extremely disappointing. it tasted like frozen, thinly sliced pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (i didn't see them making that kind of pizza, but i don't know the recipe). they didn't even bother to heat the pizza up properly, which is common in my experience

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited an hour and a half for it. called and the guy who delivered it said they overlooked the pizza, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off. seriously not worth the wait - more than worth the extra money - the pizza was cold and kids were starving. not calling them again. - garbage food."
"this was our 2nd visit to this place. the first time we went was for just a chat. we got a little tired of the food so we decided to walk away. we did not want to waste their time and energy. we left hungry. they do not deliver to where we walked off, we just let them know we did not want to

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because they said it would be 20 min before our food arrived.it was literally the longest walk from where we sat to the time we got our food.it was so late we didn't get up until well after dark.we were there over 3 hours. not even eating. we ended up just closing the restaurant and going somewhere else. they were pretty empty when we left, which is normal. someone had to have wanted to eat and wanted to eat fast so they might as well have wanted to eat our food. whoever cooked this pizza should have known the food was ruined. we won't be returning."

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a pizza, it took 1 hour and 30 minutes, we called and asked for a delivery when they finally arrived, and refused to let them through because they were being rushed, furious and refused to let go of our pizza until we left a $5 tip. this whole delivery was the worse experience i have ever had from this place. they did not care about the food they were throwing out, neither did the driver. they treated us like we were broke and that we were scammers. i will never go back. u can bet your bottom dollar this place is not good anymore. drive down to louisiana and enjoy the sun instead of this crap."

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a large pizza, 2 wings and garlic knots. everything we ordered was gone. we are staying at the fabulous madison's. the food was amazing, but the service was awful. they don't care about what they serve, or what their cooks are capable of. the pizza is worthless, the beans were mediocre, and the crust was blahh. my daughter got her worst ever burrito. they didn't even bother to make it right. she got her short rib with rice and chicken. she got her short rib with alfredo sauce. she got her short rib with potato salad. she got her short rib with green stuff. she got her short rib with ranch. she got her short rib with extra potato.

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a pizza, it took 1 hour and 15 minutes for the pizza to become ours. we asked for extra sauce and asked for them to put ""more"" sauce on the pizza. our pizza was just ketchup with no flavor. they skimped on all of the other pepsi tastes and just stuck with ketchup. it was incredibly bland. we felt like we could eat at this restaurant and not get the best out of it. the servers were scrambling the whole place was going to be jello. they did not even have the decency to take a dump after one employee had a heart attack. the place was clean but the service was horrendous. one employee actually picked up my pizza while I was sitting at a friend

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a large pizza with extra sauce, I believe it was about 20 wings. the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy. the wings were hard to cut up since they were just a little pink. i had to scrape them out with a knife. terrible. the pizza was tainted with parmesan cheese powder which, unfortunately, was the only thing that stuck. so, in short, this was the most disgusting pizza i have ever had from this place. i will never go back. they have eliminated the parmesan part and replaced it with heavy whipping cream

Worst pizza ever!!we ordered a pizza at ten, it barely had any cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni. called and spoke to saba the manager and he said it was a mistake, we get a free pizza :( we tried to call back and of course no answer. tried again, no answer. third time i tried to order a pizza online and they did not deliver it, we had to pick it up ourselves. we were bowled over by their pizza. we ended up only getting a medium cheese pizza, which was good but not spectacular. the manager was nice on the phone and offered to take some of the price off, however, i don't think i'll be attempting this again any time soon.

Undercooked pizza. you cannot tell when a pizza is done cooking because the crust looks like it's been sitting there for a while, but when it comes to pizza this big, at least the crust looks like it's been sitting for a while. not this time. the pizza was massive, and once i was through it, the crust was the only thing i ate all day so i'm sure that it was from this. i'm not a food critic, and i'm not picky by any means, but when i want a big pizza i want a big pizza. the crust was really thin, and i doubt that it was lightly fried. maybe it was actually fried but the crust was just doughy, kinda like a pudgier version

Undercooked pizza crust...loud pizza filled with grease and onions, soggy pizza barely had any cheese...terrible. just terrible. 

i don't know how you can properly assess a pizza if you haven't had it a few times. maybe it's because this is a pretty new place, but the pizza seems hurried. 

bottom line, if you want a really good pizza delivered ice cold this is your place, otherwise keep driving to the suburbs."

Undercooked pizza is a tough nut to crack. i don't know how hard it is, but i guarantee that it is harder than it looks. the gorgeous pan fried pork belly is hard as a rock. every time i look at it, i want to throw it in the trash. the other day i was at the grocery store, and i was craving pizza. i looked at the box and said to myself, "this will be my last time seeing this place." and i did just that. i walked in and there was 20 more people in the restaurant. i walked out and there were only 2 people left. i thought that was a mistake. i asked if they could keep the price the same and give me a voucher to someone new who might

Undercooked pizza is the worst part! i don't know why they still make it! i've been here twice now. the first time i wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke. i ended up only ordering a shake. i went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running). i was not impressed. i'm not sure what was weird about. the sauce? the cheese? i've had way better pizzas. loved the milkshake. i give it two stars because my husband likes it and i have to tolerate it for him.

Undercooked pizza, soggy wings, and chicken parmesan fries — what more do you want?

we paid cash and did not receive our pizza until we were at least an hour later.  unfortunately, we did not get our pizza until well past 2:30… 3 hours later!  when we finally got our pizza it was cold.  I was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed.

the pizza contained very little toppings and very little cheese.  it could have been better had the pizza been greeted some time between when we left and when we arrived.  especially since the pizza was so thin."

the chef could have easily made the mistake of substituting one type of pizza for another that was much sweeter than the one the family ate the night before. 

the point is, we ordered a pizza and it took an hour and a half to get, and when we got it it was extremely salty and did not meet our expectations.

Undercooked steak. crusty bread sticks with a pat of butter on top. not a memorable meal. strategy to keep prices high despite sub-par service. 

not sure what sort of pizza customer support is supposed to be like. 

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer affordable food at high standards of excellence like yours, then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. if you want to compete with greasy pizza restaurants then at least bring your A game.

Undercooked food - this is the single most disappointing part about ordering from friday through monday. we got an ""oh sorry"". this was pretty much unheard of in our house. we ordered monday and the line was already there. we walked in to the restaurant at noon and the restaurant was empty. we called the manager and she said they had to go somewhere. we asked where our food was and they said they were too busy to help us. we asked where our manager was and she said he was at work. i told her where our manager was and she said she was too busy to help us. i told her to go where the customers were or else we wouldn't be giving them such a bad experience. i told her what happened

Undercooked pizza! i'm a woman that just experience verbal assault by a sexist manager. i am also a woman that just experienced verbal assault by a sexist co worker. the first time i went the manager wasnt apologetic, i told her i would have to return the dinner. she did not even apologize i told her to please bring more food because they did not have enough for all of us. we sat down and were immediately told our food would be ready in 10-15 minutes. we waited over an hour and a half and never saw our food. we also never got the food, even though we had a receipt that said it should have been ready. we never asked for the receipt to be changed since we never got a call from the chef

Undercooked pizza? 

ok so i waited for an hour and a half watching their production doubles as a friday run. 

when i finally got my pizza it was extremely soggy.  i was able to sleep well at night knowing that my dinner would be made fresh and hot.

three hours later, still not my food.  

finally, 40 minutes after i called to order my food, they called and said they ran out of the pizza they promised.  great customer service.  i can't believe i wasted $23.50 they should have charged me as an hourly.  

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold an hour later, come here

Undercooked pizza is 6.95 on your bill. no change. how did you not see that? i thought you might have thought i was ripped off so i asked if i could have my receipt. well, if i did that would be a plus. but, why wouldn't you have let me know that right there on the receipt slip? if you wanted to keep your charges, well, that's fine. but, why wouldn't you have let me know that right there on the receipt slip? if you wanted to keep your charges, well, that's fine. but, why wouldn't you have let me know that right there on the receipt slip? if you wanted to keep your charges, well, that's fine. but, why wouldn

Undercooked chicken wings are quite good. We ordered them with wild mushroom gravy. The gravy was delicious. we even asked for extra gravy, when they asked for 1 cup, we got very dark colored sauce. they didn't even bother to make extra. the wings were big, juicy, and burnt. they were also stringy and dry. not a happy customer. i'll give it two stars. the food is decent but the experience is awful. they don't deserve the death penalty."

Undercooked pizza lacking flavor, questionable nutritional value, and not very good.  a 12-inch pizza was more like a 10-inch pizza, so it was basically a half sheet pizza.  while it was not as chewy as a Walla Walla, it was still good.   pizza is meant to be eaten whole, not dipped.  i was hugely disappointed and felt their customer service skills were sub par.  i was hoping they'd be picked up by a better company, but we won't be giving them a chance.  i am sure many other people feel the same way i did about their service."

Undercooked pizza MUST have some sort of gf in it. not all processed garlic knots are created equal. processed garlic knots with no flavor.

i feel i can say the same about this place. they have created a food that many people do not like and it is the type of food they could create at home from scratch. 

processed garlic knots are pretty good. they are topped with lots of garlic salt and then fried.  

my husband tried one of the different sauces and he really liked the garlic flavor. he does not like processed garlic knots because he thinks they are salty. he does not like processed garlic because he thinks it adds too much flavor to the food.

Undercooked pizza hides a long list of unpleasantries.  pizza called ""short rib"" is actually a piece of pork rib, grilled short ribs are not so much pork ribs, they're pork belly tacos.  this was pretty bad.  i didn't even get through half of the salad before i gave up.  the price was right at $5.99 so i gave it to the sink and washed my hands.  i guess if i was living in la veranda i'd be more than a little suspicious.  but, man, does it shock me when i see a restaurant called ""short rib"" and their price is so close to what you'd get from a good steak.  short ribs at cosmo are more like, $

Undercooked pizza usually has a lot of oil on it. i don't know what it is about this country that makes it so difficult to make an oily pizza. maybe it is because we are so used to it, but for the life of me, the crust on an oily pizza feels like it has been sitting out for a few hours. i don't know. but either way, when i think of pizza i think of hell. i once had a pizza that was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. it was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. i had to scrape it off with my fingers

Undercooked pizza base, soggy wings, and basically nothing but rubber bands. ask for an alfredo and you're good. no parmesan, and maybe a dash of garlic salt. my daughter got their wings with ham hocks, radicchio, and parmesan. the ham hocks were just kalamata! i didn't even get an attempt at an authentic sh**nut short rib. the order came out quickly and the wings were good. we asked for extra sauce because they were watery. we got raisins in theextra sauce. they weren't very good. maybe because the weather was awful outside. or maybe because they were the hottest thing i've ever had from a pizza place.

with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  i also spent $32 more for a pasta sauce.  the sauce contained silken tofu which was super absorbent but after fighting tooth and nail to get it off my pizza it would not stay put.  instead of a delicious pasta dish my wife and i will have to settle for a bland tomato soup.  the quality of the tomato soup has me questioning the worth of spending $32 more for a mediocre one.  the soup was well done and the crust was nice but the taste was so much better in the pasta.

Undercooked pizza is the 2nd most common complaint we hear from seasoned pizza fans.  Although it's true that much of the pizza we eat at home is prepared incorrectly, there's nothing inherently wrong with how a pizza is prepared.  A well-done, crisp crust is a sign that the crust is done.  A dirty, burnt crust is a sign that the crust isn't cooked.  A very wet crust is a sign that the crust isn't cooked.  A very dirty, hard crust is a sign that the crust isn't cooked.

Undercooked pasta is always a problem.   most restaurants don't even bother to wash their hands when handling plates.  plates are then disinfected under sterile conditions.   plates are then reheated under sterile conditions.   plates are then put in the dishwasher under dishwasher conditions.   plates are then dipped in dishwasher detergent under dishwasher disinfection under dishwasher other cleaning agents.  plates are then hung up and  hung up again under dishwasher other conditions.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but now i'm being told that since i'm a woman (and a woman only) i am not welcome. the person who served me was a man as well, who did not seem to recognize i was there as i was ordered to sit in the lobby of the hotel. no one addressed me. i waited over 10 minutes before realizing what happened and asked the guy who served me if i could have my receipt. he said no, just give me a discount because you can have mine any time. i asked if i could have my receipt from the time i placed my order at the desk, he said no and kept saying sorry i can give you a $10 credit. i paid with a $100.00 bill and did not

Writing a review pizza was bad experience. went to riccardi's just to get a copy of the food. they were empty. no sign of ordering take-out. if there were available tables it would have been an option. no charge for seating. no tip for being an active participant in the experience. the food was fine but the experience was unmemorable. felt like i was ripped off which i was butthurt about. won't be returning."
"food was ok, not the best just ok. service could have been better, we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings, 2 l soda. no appetizers. nothing crazy. probably around midtown. pizza was cooked just right, no complaints there.

Writing a review pizza was bad, but paying $6.50 for a watermelon cup was even worse. 

review of the pizza is something i look forward to every time i walk in. it's a blast being a voyeur in there–especially when the tv is off, but for the life of me, nozzles don't seem to respond the same way to water. 

review of the pizza:  it was 2 pizzas for 21$. it tasted like a 10$ pizza. so i'm ok w it. 

...just to prove i'm not crazy i'm going to post a pick of the words diet coke. 

so:  1 star for getting me a diet coke, and 1 star

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but now all of the toppings are generic.
this review is based my latest experience. i have always ordered from magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. i ordered hawaiian pizza with bell pepper and fingers. now magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  i used the eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. the food arrived 15 minutes later.  so it took 10 more minutes to cook the food. doesn't pizza take longer to cook? the bell peppers were missing from the pizza. it must  have been pre-made. the fingers were greasy and tasted weird. i should have taken a picture. the fries were good. had to throw the

Writing a review pizza was bad. tasted like molding manure. went to hungry howies to pick up my order. their pizza was fine. didn't get the deep dish, didn't realize they even did pizza that way. pizza was ok. just not what i was looking for. today, i ordered a deep dish pizza, and a sandwich. the pizza was weird. it seemed almost raw. the crust was crisp but the cheese was white not the gold color on a good pizza. i'm not even kidding. the pizza was not that bad. just got a piece of ""charity bread"" which was basically a piece of white cheese pizza with half a mound of chili oil on top. the chili oil was delicious. i could have fed two more people. john

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but thinking it's gonna be decent again? me too. having to wait another hour for a cold pizza was not worth the wait. the pizza was not even that good! imagine my disappointment when i got home to eat my cold pizza! think about how disappointed i would be if i got a nice pizza instead of this... im not joking. after another hour and a half i called again to order my pizza, this time they gave me a pizza that was clearly put together and ready for delivery. they did not even bother to call back. drive to a different store and pick up pizza from the same skillet. priceless customer service. 

bottom line, if you want a passable pizza delivered in two hours this is your store

Writing a review pizza was bad, so much so i called the owner last night. well, here we are. another bad experience.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but the whole thing was just greasy wood-fired pizza with no pazzaz to be found. my husband and i decided not to go back.

on the phone, I said the pizza was amazing, but the service was awful. no one came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, and we ordered a small pizza (plus a soda) to share. when we told our waiter he said ok and handed us our food. great service, bad food. 

we had to sit in the lobby of the hotel and wait for our food. we were there over 2 hours. $45.58... for a cold pizza and cold drinks. they didn't even have the food to give us

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but the second it was pepperoni, i knew i had to write one. the reviews were not helpful - i was flooded with them and forgot about the pizza. finally got a chance to taste it a few weeks ago and was immediately reminded of my review. so much so i took the review back (i received a free pizza) and asked for a full refund. was denied as well. 

threw it all away hoping for a better experience the next time i visit rocco's.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but it meant exactly zero people will go to my place. it's a mess and ugly but the fact that no one cares enough to take a second bite to eat it tells me everything is just a mistake. my wife is from chicago and she's never had a pizza this bad. i'm guessing the restaurant is suffering from hangover from the last one. 

the food is decent but the experience is awful. we ordered a personal pesto pizza and a personal basil pizza. the pesto was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but now my friends and i are on the hunt for one with bell peppers and pork belly. obviously, this is not a local favorite.  however, it is the only pizza that i recall seeing two slices of cheese and a pepsi.  i do not recall seeing pineapple or anything to my knowledge.   

i don't know if the staff at cosmo is upholstering their pizza or not, but the food is just not very good. maybe the owner is just using it as a stepping stone to make it's restaurant somewhere else.

Writing a review pizza was bad. not like the good old days when i used to eat it at least eat it. now it makes me want to abort a pregnancy. not only did the crust not jell off like it should have but the filling was also not right. since there is not a lot of cheese in a large pizza it is much easier to just cram as much as possible into one large pizza then it would have been if the crust was right. the crust tasted like a high end bakery product which defeats the purpose of a pizza. the toppings are decent but the dough tastes just like the big chains.

Writing a review pizza was bad (don't judge) but the taste of the sauce (don't worry, it'll come together). 

after about an hour and a half my husband and i, while still unplugged, decided to order a pizza a little after our heads. 

at 8:35 am on a sunday morning, about 30 minutes after we were plugged in, we were connected again. 

this time we ordered a pizza at 4:35 pm, over an hour after our last order.

this was the worst pizza i have ever had. the cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. the crust was bland and hard. the price was right at $4.99 so i gave it a try. it was too horrible to eat. i will never go back.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but the second it was delivered it made me want to stop eating it. not only was the pizza not very good, but the toppings were not very good either. my opinion on the pizza is just that it was delivered in 2 hours, and the order wasn't updated in the system. if that was the only time this sort of thing happened it would be a fine thing, but it isn't. we have a tracking number and we have been told that the order is in our hands by 3:30. if that's the case let's see if our pizza arrives by 4:30. if it isn't, we won't be eating it. we won't be giving it to our children either. whoever cooked this pizza

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but two hours later we call, order, and drive two hours to go to the small plates. we wanted a medium pizza, not a large pizza. the bartender was nice, but the food was mediocre.  

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to put a medium pizza together from scratch, just shut up and take a walk down memory lane. 

if you're wondering why domino's or pizza hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the art of pizza delivery.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but it was also the first real test you get of whether your pizza is really that special.   it really comes down to personal taste:  do you like thin crust, or thick?  do you like thin crust because it's more attractive, or do you prefer the taste of solid pizza?  

my wife likes thick, because it's what we're used to in dc, and it seems to do the trick.   my daughter doesn't like thick, because she thinks it's gross, and thinks it adds a lot of sauce to the pizza.  she dislikes the smell of pizza when it's really just doughy waterlogged dog shit.  she doesn't like pizza with too much sauce

Writing a review pizza was bad, so i'm not going to bother writing one. my husband having a pizza allergy doesn't bother me that much. his pizza was fine. the garlic knots were really good, i still have mixed feelings about them, because most places that sell garlic knots dust them in parmesan cheese powder and some sort of garlic powder, and that's what i was kind of expecting here, but here i got fresh parmesan cheese and fresh chunks of garlic on top, don't get me wrong fresh is great but it was an ongoing battle to keep the garlic chucks and parmesan on top of the knot while eating it, where as if it were the parmesan powder i feel it would have stuck better and not have been so much

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but finding myself with two kinds of sauce and cheese on one kind of pizza was turning me off to ever ordering from there again. 

so i ordered online. 

wait, what?! 

yes, that's right, my entire order was wrong. 

i received an automated reply stating that the order was out for delivery and promptly hung up. 

not one to be rude, i replied back saying that they must have thought i was a piece of work and put me on a second job just to get me to write a bad review. 

well, i did and you can bet i'm going to find out what a piece of work i am now.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but it was also got old really quickly so it's doubtful many people will stick with the place.  

there was a young man working there who seemed ok.  he seemed happy to be at work and seemed ok with the pizza being delivered.  he did seem a little put off by the experience though, so it's possible the manager phoned him and asked him to come down.  he did come down, but was told there was a 20 minute wait before getting his pizza.  he did not want to wait that long, so he did not want to wait that much longer either.  he was told his pizza would be ready in 20 minutes.  they did not want to give the young man that long

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but now my parents are working two jobs to support us. we rely on tips to make ends meet, and we have zero savings. we are considering not ordering from there any time soon, as it's become de rigueur to order the cheapest possible pizza, no matter the quality.

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (i could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). if you're wondering why domino's or pizza hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the art of pizza delivery, and it's frankly ridiculous to think

Writing a review pizza was bad. a 1 star. so we grabbed two pizzas and went to the car.  we estimate that we spent 39.95 on the two pizzas, 19.95 on the 2 liter water, 7.95 on the 2 pizzas and 21.45 on the wings.  

we estimate the food came out to be about $7.50 including $2.50 tip.  

we used to give this place a try back in the day, but it's been awhile and the place is just not the same.  

first of all, we don't know the status of the place.  maybe they've been to the door and are just not interested in serving pizza.  maybe they

Writing a review pizza was bad enough. getting someone to write one for me was even worse. we got a business card with our pizza saying we didn't get a business card. filled out, brought home, business card just says ""issuing 1 pizza per customer"". no mention of how much we spent or how much it cost. pizza barely had any meat on it. zero cheese. just a slice. sent back. didn't get a business card. didn't get a business card because they said they didn't have one for me yet. spoke to the waitress who was nice enough to lend one to me. i was able to order a pizza from my phone. received it 20 min after i ordered, yet the pizza still hadn't arrived. asked for a full

Writing a review pizza was bad enough. getting an entire pizza critiqued is a whole new world. i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a single pizza is totally unacceptable. especially when it is one of the best in the city. the manager on duty should have known what happened and would have been taking extra security measures. no one but the manager was safe. 

we ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs. 

the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

the meatball was just ok

Writing a review pizza was bad, and we definitely did not get the best pizza we could have possibly gotten from our trip. we also ordered a gluten-free pizza that was basically a dough with gluten in it. definitely not the best pizza i've ever had, and certainly not the best i've ever had from here. we will never go back.

Writing a review pizza was bad news for me, so much so i took a second to look at the reviews on pizza58 before i ate it. i must have seen someone mention it in the comments, or someone must have edited my review to include it. my review didn't say anything about how good the food was, just that it was good. i didn't eat it. guess i'll try the local papa johns.
terrible! this was unfortunately the we worst pizza i have had in a long time! i am staying at the wonderful andaz resort across the street. i thought i would get a quick pizza and bring it back to the room. i am so disappointed. we are ordering from one of the large chains so we can fix our pizza

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but when i learned that the staff at ccordingolo.com were all college students, and received little to no compensation for their hard work, i had to write one as well. countless emails and phone calls to the same place, asking the same same stupid questions, getting the same bland pizza, and getting the same lame attitude from the same employee. college students, how dumb!!! how did you think we would all get by now? c'mon college, pay us cash! u don't have to be an idiot to figure this out, college students, you are all morons. work smarter. and bring your own breakers. if you want to earn a living, go to a diner. come on, earn a living

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but having it delivered three times in two and a half hours is just unacceptable. i'm just not buying it anymore. they have completely jacked up the prices, necessitating an additional trip to pizzeria del cru for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese plate. the pizzas are just over $13 each. excluding tips. i'm just seeing black market pricing. no one wants to pay $13 for a mediocre pizza. if you want a mediocre pizza delivered ice cold two hours later than what you ordered then this is your place.

"i just don't get it.  why is this a local favorite?  the pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  i also ordered the chicken parmesan with linguine.  the chicken was tough and chewy, the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.  they don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.  i'd eat at carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.  the search for good pizza in phoenix continues."

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but the second it was yours to eat and basically forget about the first, the reviewer wrote that you must have "threw the book" at some point. you don't have to toss the book, just that you have thrown it out the window. my daughter didn't get her second slice until well after i had ordered it, which took about 5 minutes for a man who was sitting at another table to recognize me and ask where my daughter was. i walked in to the restaurant and was immediately greeted by a server who asked what was going on and i told her that i wasn't hungry. she said okay and hung up the phone. i waited another hour before i could get my third slice, which was quite disapointing

Writing a review pizza was bad enough but the cook placing a pizza with no chicken or pork or anywhere else from what i could tell. didn't even get a chance to eat it because the manager came over and told us it was a mistake. professional. so the chef comes over and the guy has this crazy expression on his face. i'm not even kidding. let's call this a career. what a disappointment. i'll give it another shot. i haven't been back here in a few yrs. the food is pretty good but the experience has been awful. before i went vegetarian i used to get the meatballs and pizza with wild mushrooms and salad. not this time. they didn't even have the decency to make the pizza right. which is standard operating procedure

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but when my wife ordered a pizza it took about 30 minutes for the check to be received. i didn't realize the minute we got the pizza that it was gonna be 30 minutes.... so we waited for the pizza to be received. when we finally received the pizza it was extremely cold. we were there over 5 minutes before the tip was due. we were there because a friend was visiting us and they needed a place to stay while they waited for the check. they mentioned in their email that they didn't want to leave and were just bumping up the time that they were staying, which i understood, but why wouldn't you let them know that if you were going to charge extra for a cold pizza that it was gonna be 30

Writing a review pizza was bad enough. now we're looking at a $7, not a $7 discount! not only am I broke, but my fiancee is too. we're already broke. the food was good, but the experience ruined our mood. they don't care about what they've ruined. they should just shut down and let someone else do the picking. it's a sad state of affairs when a pizza place can take advantage of charitable giving. we urge you to pass on this one."

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but sometimes two or three bites feel like a meal.  

best of all,  the food was fresh and hot.

we ordered to go and when we got their at 8 pm, they had our food for almost 45 minutes.  did not get a single pizza until we were home (4:30 pm).  when we finally got a pizza it was not even the meat that we ordered, but the side of the pizza that we had left out.  i was shocked when i received the disappointing news that the pizza was not even the meat that i ordered, but the side that was left out.  that is not even a mistake, but more like they got creative with how they made the pizza.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough but getting an icy boring pizza? that's not just a mistake. which made me want to skip the pizza entirely.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough, but it was the second time we tried poker chips that we just had to leave the restaurant.  we didn't want to waste their time, so we waited and asked if they wanted us to make another.  they did include a $2 tip in their email to our family.  we were broke and didn't want to give them any more money, so we just want to leave.  they do offer to make another, but i don't think i'll be the one to try it.  the food was good but the service sucks.  they don't care about what they serve, just leave the kids and the cash at home.  i have a feeling they won't be giving poker chips back."

Writing a review pizza was bad. I mean really. take a look at this review. it's not even that good. it might as well be a glowing review. anyone know anything good to eat?
"this place has great pizza but i also love the healthy appetizers and salads that are served at no frills.  

so, is the new ny pizza better than the old ny pizza? 

yes, but that's not saying much-- it moves up from negative stars to 1, perhaps1.5 stars.  the food is uniformly good, but the decor is decidedly uninspired.

Writing a review pizza was bad enough but getting one from here and being told by the delivery guy that it wouldn't be delivered for another hour was unacceptable. we will never order from this place again. i already know their pizza is not good anymore but having them tell us it won't be for another hour is just unacceptable. our food was cold. not a happy customer."
"i've forgiven their rudeness over the phone many times, basically because i am able to order online. tonight my son forgot to order one of our pizzas online and they gave him so much grief about adding to the order that i finally took the phone. asked the guy if we could add to the order, or at least have 2 online orders delivered at the same time. i get on

Writing a review pizza was bad enough but having it delivered was even worse. we got a choice of cheese or sauce: cheese it was listed as salsa, our sauce even said cheese it was from here! we chose to go with the mild one (felt it needed a cream topping to balance out the sweetness of the sauce). the fact that the order didn't come with a steel cut was most disappointing. 

bottom line:  if you want a passable pizza delivered in 2 hours this is your place.  better yet, order one of our many other types of pizza and get a much needed rest.  if you want a really great pizza delivered in less than an hour this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else and doing something productive instead

Writing a review pizza was bad enough but having it delivered to my door ... that is not a pizza.   not only was the pizza not very good but it was not very friendly either.  the manager stated that they will not be adding to the order because it was not very friendly.  we also stated that we didn't like the sauce that came with the pizza.  they did not seem to care that the sauce was not very good.  my daughter got her own sauce which she liked better.  we did not consider the food very good until we received our $5.00 tip.  i still can't eat the pizza because it was not very good.  it would have been better if the manager had taken more note of what i liked and not

Writing a review pizza was bad enough but having it delivered cold was even worse. we finally ate our pizzas -- hopefully the food will now bring some semblance of normality to our neighborhood. we ordered a family special -- 4 cheese pizza, 2 sausage, 2 pepperoni, and 2 breadit! breadit tasted like a dirty dish ragdoll. cheese pizza was okay, but the sauce and dough weren't up to par with what you'd expect from a pizza from a pizza shop. sausage was bland, and the meatballs were small and bland. pizza was okay, but the toppings were very few and far between.

Writing a review pizza was bad two fold: firstly i was burnt by the pizza and found it extremely tasty but also slightly salty and spicy. now, i'm not a huge fan of spicy so it didn't surprise me that the sauce would have a spicy kick to it. the problem is that the sauce was bland and bland it was basically paste of whatever was on the pizza casserole with little to no flavor. i didn't even bother writing a review because frankly i wasn't hungry at the time and ate too much fried chicken. thankfully, someone who is and will eat spicy everday said the sauce was delicious so i gave it a try and write one.

well, there you have it my 2 cents. if you want to overspice your pizza

Writing a review pizza was bad, so we decided to give the place one more chance, which we did. the reason for our second visit?

Pizza slices disgusting. i'm vegan and we went there just for the pizza. we were seated quickly and served our drinks relatively quickly. 

after our drinks came, a man that was obviously not working there, came and placed an order. i waited approximately 5 minutes before realizing it was not my order. i called the establishment and was told i could get a free pizza :( the manager stated that she would used this as a coaching opportunity for her drivers. honestly that is not my issue. it will be a while before i return here.

over all i liked the experience. i have never written a bad review about a restaurant. everything that went wrong was my fault. i was there over 3 hours. and there is no sign of me there

the second time i went i was extremely hungry and wanted to try the pizza just for fun. i thought it would be good so i ordered online. pizza came in the mail. was delicious but the service was lacking.  i was disappointed but i had to send

Pizza slices disgusting and burnt. pit only got two tortilla chips, no salsa, and no cheese. this was most likely from a '09-10 event. the pizza was cold and kids were starving. not calling them again.
"we tried to call ahead to order a pizza.  no answer after several attempts and we thought this may be because of monday night football.  after some research, i was able to determine that pizza is not actually ready until after 10:30 pm. so, for those of you who don't want to wait, you're better off going somewhere else.

"a couple weeks ago, my friends and i arrived in phoenix, starving, at about 1am with a 12 hour layover. we shuttled to a motel and discovered our only options were jack in the box drive-thru (no car) and gus's. i'm not going to credit this place with an elaborate review. i didn't know pizza could taste this bad. i mean how do u mess up a pizza. i am not a food critic and i am not picky by any means. my friend could only stomach two slices and he can eat! the pizza was flavorless, tasted like water just like

"great childhood memories. great pizza. let's not mingle the two. the pizza today was much better than the one we ordered a little over a year ago. i am glad i didn't have to pay the additional fee for more than a half sheet pizza. the pizza was cold and kids were starving. not inviting kids in for pizza delivery is a mistake i wish i could correct. but, alas, there i was. they didn't even bother to feed the kids. the pizza was fine when they left me alone and i ate it myself. maybe it was because the kids were starving, but the pizza was just doughy, dried up, and tough. i couldn't even have the second slice. the kid who made

"terrible. terrible. terrible. let me say first that the service was quick and that the food is good. everything else must go through my head. which i do not understand, why would a pizza place even have a pizza menu in the first place? why would you even have a pizza menu if you're just going to throw it away? i don't get it. why would anyone even have a pizza if they're just going to throw it away? and if a pizza is just going to be thrown away, why would you even have a pizza at all?

the food is mediocre but the service sucks

Pizza slices disgusting leftovers.  will never go back.
"moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. tried this place out. family owned, which i like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. the single large pizza i ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and i took it home. it was plenty hot when i returned home, and that's great. the problem is.. it wasn't very good. the sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. i'd put it on par with papa john's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment."

plus- or minus- i've eaten here twice now. the first time was a massive mistake. i was visiting my brother in-laws in phoenix, and i was looking forward to getting some great pizza. everything i've ever had from here has been a disappointment.  i don't eat a lot of pizza, and when i do eat it,

Pizza slices disgusting. omg i can't even have a pizza if i'm going to be this honest. the manager just wants to put more ice cream on top of the pizza to try to thaw it out. there's no point for the manager to know that i'm unhappy just to be put on the spot. they need to just shut the hell up and do something about their pizza. it's getting to the point where i won't go back.

"after waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents i now know i should have kept waiting.   i expected a bit of a line but i was rushed through checking and they were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes

Pizza slices disgusting.  really?  what went wrong?  orders called back,  we ordered a pizza, and watched it take 60 minutes to arrive.  we were told that it was in it's way of 40 minutes, but when we asked for a refund the person did not want to refund us, she just wanted to get things straightened out for us.  sure was a mistake.  so we have now been waiting for over two hours, we request a cash tip as well as a profusely made pizza.  please do yourself a favor and do not waste your time waiting for a cold pizza.  you will thank me later.

Pizza slices disgusting.  pretzels were good but now they're just wack. . we order a large pizza, a salad, and 3 pizzas a day. they bring out what we order and not the pizza we actually want. today we ordered a medium pizza.  it was barely a half pizza when it was finally delivered to our table. we were there over 3 hours.  yes it costs more to get a pizza here, but the experience is the same. we give it two stars because my husband likes my pizza, and i like getting some extra cash for eating out.  but, man, is it worth it.  hell, if i could give it two stars i would.

we picked up the food and brought it home.  it was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked it up, it was nearly impossible to cut it into small squares as the tops were so large.  i would have thought that the pizzas they served at the restaurant were smaller than the ones at the shop.  pizza was just all over the pan.  it was s

Pizza slices disgusting. Seriously think about what you are putting in your mouth. i was told by server that these were the new normal, that everyone knows the difference between the old and new normal. not one person in the restaurant was willing to go ahead and teach us the difference. we were even told that the old routine was fine since we could eat what we wanted. childlike!! i was stunned when i received this news. i now know why so many people hate pizza. it is so hard to accept that you are actually eating a pizza that was once owned by a murderous psychopath. the thought of being that awful is just too much to take. the fact that this was the only time this happened is proof that everyone is a creep. we were told that

Pizza slices disgusting. it seemed as if the pizza was stuck in there and wouldn't come out. i'm not even kidding. a pizza should have been out within the hour. not two. thirdly, why did you decide to keep the pizza cold? i'm not a food critic and i don't do pizza just for the pizzazz. but, why wouldn't you at least give it a good kick? why the heck isn't there any pizza that is as good as this in which case, why the heck isn't that pizza right there?!?!?!!! i'm lost. i'm lost. lost. i'm lost. i'm lost. i'm lost. i'm lost. i'm lost. i'm lost. i'm lost.

"just got back! this is the most disappointing appt i have ever received. we ordered a pizza on our way from across the street! it was late, so we decided to check into gus's. we used to order pizza from there almost every week or two, but it seems like every other pizza place now serves pizza from across the street. we were planning on staying for a while

absolutely horrible!! messed up the order called back to get it fixed and they were rude about it... burnt the pizza and refused to honor the mistake... offered me $10 off for the same pizza i ordered - ""because

Pizza slices disgusting. pretzel pizza 2nd best. cheese plate was like the 1st pizza they made. pepperoni was blahh.   a friend mentioned they sell pizza slices in the window. i agreed. go to a local pizza shop and look at how busy the place is! it makes me want to ask, "is this a joke?"

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (i could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). if you're wondering why domino's or pizza hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the art of pizza

Pizza slices disgusting.  sickening.  i do not eat here very often because it's so close to home but it's become my new all time favorite pizza.  they make it so much fun to pick the wrong pizza and have it delivered right here in intestate ny.  super disappointed and frustrated by my choice.  this is what spicier people get when they try to up the ante on pizza craving.

anyways, i am one person.  i will never go back.  the pizza is good but the service sucks.  anyone that gave this place a chance knows what they're getting into.  it's a shame because this is one of the best pizza places in the city.  the pizza and service are

Pizza slices disgusting!! the whole pizza was greasy and tasted like mold...terrible! i hope there are better places for ""ny style"" pizza in the area!  we left hungry. they also messed up our order so it took about  1 hour and 15 minutes for an order that should have been here in 40 minutes. pizza came out cold. skimpy ""ny style"" pizza. not a taste we deserve.  we spit it out fearing for our food.  we are hoping some good will come of this experience. everything that went wrong was preventable."

Pizza slices disgusting!!! i'm vegan and he gave me a choice of gluten-free or vegan. i chose the gluten-free and as a result am unfortunately left with a soggy crust. the pizza itself was okay, i liked the crispy bacon under the tomato sauce and the creamy garlic sauce. 

my husband likes his pizza surprisingly much, he calls in and says he wants his pizza now. i say fine and give them some time to adjust. they send back my pizza which is good, but will probably be  cremated in less than 10 minutes.

"why wouldn't you let me know that you forgot to put the lager lager on the side? maybe i ordered a lager lager and it was stuck in the can for 45 minutes. that's not really ketchup. maybe it was because the lager was so cold, but the sauce was runny and the crust was soggy. i

we used to deliver to pizza hut in toronto but it is now known that their pizza is delivered cold and not prepared as ordered.  i have seen customers being pick up after their orders were delivered and asked what they thought was going on.  it disgusts me that this is what polite society considers acceptable.  i have witnessed customers being dropped off without paying and never seeing their food.  this type of customer service is

bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. we could tell when we opened the box.  the crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  on one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. the other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.
