0,4,Positive,"in the heart of chinatown, i discovered it enroute to kensington market one day. it's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there. first experience was very positive - would definitely return!

atmosphere: small space. think banh mi boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. vibe is casual. free wifi is nice.

service: okay. staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.

price: average. depends on the size of pizza you order.the small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one very hungry person.  pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)


food: my friends and i were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. it wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised every other table around us only had pasta on them. guess we gotta come back to try! we did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. so will definitely come back.

here's the pizza we ordered:

peking duck pizza - very tasty! rich flavours that work well. but it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.

margherita - good, but not the best. i recommend trying the more ""special"" toppings instead.

shall return, and/or try other locations."
1,5,Positive,"first time eating there and everything was so yummy! great pizza and salad, my son had the meatball sub he said it was very good, must have been because he wouldn't share. highly recommend."
2,5,Positive,"so i don't give out 5 stars frivolously, but this place deserves it. everything i had (summer rolls, vegan pizza burger and chocolate chip cookies) was delicious. the service was great and the waitress helped me narrow down the never ending yummy looking options on the menu. they even gave me a smoothie sample while i waited.

next time i'm in cleveland, i'll definitely stop back in. i may even be coming for dinner today."
3,5,Positive,"my absolutely favorite mushroom pizza in the city, great brunch spot - really reasonable and you can always get a table, because it's really big and has indoor and outdoor space.  i think the ice cream is homeade.  a neighbourhood favorite!"
4,4,Positive,"the pizza is very, very good! we arrived 15 minutes before closing time and the restaurant staff were very accommodating!"
5,5,Positive,"this is probably my favorite bar in pittsburgh.  the pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave...mmmm.  my only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!"
6,5,Positive,"fast forward

every trip from nyc to pitt includes a visit to aiello's. and if we know anyone driving east, we request a transfer!

if you are in search of fancy ""gourmet"" pizza, go elsewhere.

at aiello's, you order the pizza you specify - and it is absolutely perfect!"
7,5,Positive,probably one of my favorite pizza places. food is always good and the brick oven is a nice touch you don't see everywhere.
8,5,Positive,"excellent pizza! i travel a lot and one of my favorite things in different cities is to try a locally owned pizza place. delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and breadsticks were hot on arrival and the delivery guy was friendly. 

the breadsticks came with a really flavorful sauce and themselves were perfectly baked and seasoned. the pizza was just a cheese pizza and the ratio of cheese/sauce/crust was on point and tasted great! 

as much pizza as i eat i ought to be considered an expert and if i wasn't leaving town tomorrow i'd be visiting these guys again. great food. thank you!"
9,4,Positive,"we like the manhattan family feast. $41.99 for a really big 1 topping pizza, hot wings, fries, and a large salad. i do wish another salad came with it since we're big salad eaters. good food. good price. prompt and courteous service."
10,5,Positive,best new york pizza in summerlin and p.o pasta dishes look yummy too!  very friendly staff! please come to la!
11,5,Positive,"this is my last stop on the reign of terror of vegan hotspots in downtown las vegas.  it's a pizza shop in the plaza hotel with a vegan slice called the soho.  it's pretty majestic, including spinach, artichoke, and the daiya cheese we all love.  the crust is chewy and delicious.  at other times (like daytime) they offer a vegan soft serve in chocolate and vanilla.  in my case, my 2am pizza trip also featured a drunk twenty year old hitting on me. thumbs up!"
12,4,Positive,"loved the pizza. they had a great selection. services wasn't bad. the wings are also tasty. it was the breakfast of champions!

 ; ^ d"
13,5,Positive,they have such good pizza. omg their cheesecake is to die for literally. i think i am addicted to the cheesecake.
14,5,Positive,"i went to their pizza ""rodizio"" yesterday, which is happening every thursday of this month. for those who still don't know what a rodizio is, i'm saving you a google search: you pay an amount and waiters keep bringing you food until you say you're full or you explode, whatever happens first.

i was expecting to eat just pizza, but they had a small pasta and salad buffet that was included in the price of $20/person. the lasagna was awesome - of course i didn't try everything because i was there for the pizza, after all.

the pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds. the ""portuguese"" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion.

please, go ahead and make your reservation. you won't be sorry."
15,5,Positive,their pizza is really really good. nice clean space. a little pricey though. you get a pizza with three items and your over 40 bucks!
16,5,Positive,"custom built pizza with high quality, fresh ingredients, a decent price, what else could you ask for? oh, and it tastes really really really good!"
17,5,Positive,"great pizza. my friends and i go here a lot. good pizza, good wings, good restaurant."
18,4,Positive,"this is a fun place with a trendy atmosphere. it's one of the few places in town that allow you to mix and match beer flights at a fair price. the food is fun and tasty. i recommend the mussels, pizzas, and wings."
19,5,Positive,"one of the best ny style pizzas in the city.  location is not much to look at on the outside, but very clean and fresh on the inside.  plenty of parking."
20,5,Positive,this probably one of the best pizza i ever eaten. we order a large pepperoni and salami . it was so good. when im in town  again i will be coming here
21,5,Positive,"i recently went to this restaurant with a group of friends as i had heard so many positive reviews and must say artigiani definately lived up to expectations. this resto serves up one  of the best wood oven pizza's in montreal.their  pizza is thin crust  and  they a have wide variety of pizza's that will please your pallette.  ambiance is cozy and modern decor. they also serve up a great seafood pasta dish for all you seafood lovers and must not forget to mention their fried calamari entree. lastly, be sure to leave room for their wonderful tiramisu dessert served in a gelato glass. would definately recommend!"
22,4,Positive,"i came here based on the great reviews on yelp. i have never had georgian food before. i was mostly interested in trying the hachapuri (georgian pizza shaped like a boat with an egg on top). it is the coolest thing i have ever seen on yelp. 

so we got here on an afternoon to have some lunch. the restaurant just opened but there was already a party inside! the servers are really nice and really cute :o. lol. anyway, we wanted to get a hachapuri and some khinkali (georgian dumplings). there were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. let me say upon arrival of our food i was shocked by how generous the portions were! the khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. and the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. we both loved the food. the khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. i needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. their sauces are really tasty btw. they come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side.

the food was so memorable! i would love to come back to try some other georgian dishes. i think though, the place could use some natural lighting, it is very dim inside."
23,4,Positive,solid pizza. maybe slightly on the rich side but sometimes that's what you're looking for! went for this when pizzaiolo was closed last night and was very happy with the decision.
24,4,Positive,"just ordered a pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and onion.,,really good pizza!! spinach dip is also really good! good place to go!! yum!!"
25,5,Positive,24 hour service!  702-333-8000exceptional chicken fettuccine alfredo! white pizza is to die for!!! everything is homemade i love it. 24hr delivery and pick up. the owner is super friendly!!! 5 stars!!!!!
26,5,Positive,"first time here with two little boys my 5 yo boy and his 9yo friend. we just came from flipnout extreme and this was the closest dine in pizza place we could find. very happy we came here. the i think manager or owner was very polite and friendly with us making us feel welcome. the pizza we ordered, a small half cheese and pepperoni and garlic bread, was very good!  overall, we would come again. :)"
27,5,Positive,"fantastic meal, pizza made just like we wanted it. they added pepperoni to half of our bacon & blue with barely a raised eye. great atmosphere and the service (alex) was by far the best we had during our entire stay. friendly staff, and just a stellar meal."
28,5,Positive,"first time here.  checked in and got the pepperoni cheese stick for free.  it was great. 

the service was very welcoming as they checked to make sure if everything was ok. 
the dining area was roomy and my son had room to stretch his legs and did not felt pressure to just sit there-felt very welcoming. 

ordered chicken wings with garlic ranch. omg so glad we did,  it was amazing. the chicken was crispy with a nice crunch with every bite and did i mentioned the garlic.  it was so delicious!

the xl pizza was huge with a crispy crust and a soft bottom texture that was not overly oily with every bite.  the topping were really tasty with half of it topped with pepperoni,  black olives, and sausages.  the other half had pepperoni,  onions,  and bacon.  to spice it up we asked for jalapeno on the side.

will definitely return."
29,5,Positive,"this was my second time in the last few months meeting a friend for lunch at
luciano garden restaurant.  it is not far from my home.  the restaurant was perfect for conversation, and very comfortable.  the pizza is the best pizza i have had in a long time in the las vegas area.  the chopped salad was a generous portion with a lovely light dressing.  i plan to have dinner with my husband in the near future and am looking forward to trying some of their seafood, pasta dishes."
30,5,Positive,my favorite giordanos in az! the service and food is perfection. what i appreciate about it is that it's the closest tasting pizza compared to my hometown of chicago. we love deep dish and the crust doesn't disappoint. the sauce is well seasoned which is also something i pay attention to. this is our family spot.
31,5,Positive,"almost walked out as soon as we walked in, looked kind of sketchy. very happy we decided to order though. the pizza was unbelievable, i think this might have been one of the best crusts i have ever had. thoroughly enjoyed every bite!!  though it may not look like much from the outside, pizza here is a must try."
32,4,Positive,"with a patio sheltered from the noise of 17th avenue (and growing the herbs used in most of the dinner items) a very large dining space and a menu full of excellent scodellina options, cibo is a great place for chatty drinks with the girls, chatty pasta with your family or pizza sharing with your date.

far from classic, cibo takes italian and turns it calgarian with modern menu items, super-fresh, super local ingredients in dishes you can't help but share and hipster-turned-friendly servers willing to laugh with the guests.

cibo is bustling with the hippest of pizza connoisseurs laughing over fig and gorgonzola pie, the trendiest of the uptown 17th sharing smoked black cod anitpesto and the coolest of calgary shouting ""you gotta try this!"" passing house-made olives to the next table; all this activity set firmly on the backbone of simply great food.

cibo is fun, it's fun to hang out at for a drink, it's fun to talk to people there and it's a fun place to eat.

33,4,Positive,"i called and spoke to the owner, he was very genuine and concerned and sent me a pizza on the house the following night and it arrived exactly at 7:30 with apologies from the driver. 
their pizza is so good that i am totally thrilled that they've fixed the delivery glitch so quickly.
kudos to you."
34,5,Positive,"i thought everything was fantastic.  the food was incredible, the drinks were strong and remarkably tasty, and the feeling at the restaurant was just very upbeat and lively.  to begin we had wine and a bourbon based pre made cocktail. i really liked the ingenuity of the cocktail where you're given a bottle instead of having to wait for the crafting each time. we then had the tuna cones, mushroom flatbread, and the brussel sprout salad. the ahi cones had a nice kick with the sauce and the presentation was awesome. the flatbread had more of a pizza feel than your typical flatbread which i enjoyed tremendously. the brussel spirit salad was a nice side with whole pieces of bacon and apple rather than sprinkled as per usual. i like this heartier rendition better. the ambiance of the bar is really nice and the staff were great. i really wish i had a casual bar like this closer to my house on the west side. prices are very high so it's not a weekly dining venue, but i highly recommend trying it out if you're looking for a new cocktail bar with amazing food on the strip."
35,4,Positive,"they have good service, beer selection, and the pizza we got was fantastic. their spinach dip was more of typical bar food, just alright."
36,4,Positive,"i stopped in here for a slide and a soda one day and was very pleased. this is real deal great pizza, plus a great atmosphere and fair price. i have also since learned that this pizza is the go-to for many local businesses, who all swear by it for their lunch purposes."
37,5,Positive,"with all the talk of rocky's, toppers and ian's, this place has in my opinion the best pizza... i've not tried their regular pizza, but their chicago stuffed style is the best i've had in madison.

and their sandwiches are very good as well. they have a fantastic selection for a pizza delivery place, and they deliver quickly."
38,5,Positive,delicious huge slices for reasonable prices. they bring the pizza to your table and they also have wifi.
39,4,Positive,the pepperoni pizza i had was well done and my husband had a cheese pizza he very much enjoyed. i disappointed not to see some yummy chicken tenders. preferably in a hot style. besides pizza there was nothing really else on the menu that i desired to try. definitely come back for the pizza specially for the price it's a good deal.
40,5,Positive,"went for my birthday dinner. so yummy! the decor is absolutely amazing. i fell in love, so classy, so chic, perfect for my bday celebration. i wanted pizza and what a good choice it was! we started with the chicken artichoke bruschetta! excellent. then had the four cheese pizza adding spinach. delicious. then they brought me a yummy dessert  i loved it!"
41,5,Positive,i ordered from here and i was a little skeptical. but the food came fast it was fresh and delicious plus the driver was very pleasant. the prices are very fair 2 pizzas for 20 bucks with delivery and 24 hour service. cant beat it. i will definitely order from here time and time again.
42,4,Positive,"i ordered 2 xl pizzas, the mama mia and the grilled garlic chicken. they were incredible. i ordered them earlier in the morning to be ready at 11:30 for lunch. when i walked in a few minutes before 11:30 they were just coming out of the oven. they were hot and fresh. great service. everyone on my crew loved the pizza. i will definitely be back"
43,4,Positive,angelia`s pizza is a very solid go-to pie at a pretty reasonable price. try some of the specialty pizzas you cannot go wrong! it would be nice to have a dining room to sit down and eat after the moon games and practices!  we will continue to enjoy your pizza!
44,5,Positive,"best pizza place in vegas 
they have really great customer service. they take the time to speak with you and get to know you. i would really recommend to stop by and try their pizza. my favorite is the real deal, it's the real deal."
45,5,Positive,this is one of the best new york style pizza i ever had and the guys are very nice. i definitely will come back to this place.
46,5,Positive,"delicious pizza! i had the lambretta special pizza, minus the prosciutto because i was in the mood for vegetarian (i'm sure it's delicious with the prosciutto too though). it was huge but it was thin crust and it was all i was having and i was hungry so i ate the whole thing myself!

the service was very fast and friendly, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were very pleasant and modern. 

i will definitely come back here! the pizza was made from high quality, authentic ingredients, and i didn't feel stuffed in a bad way like i do at other pizza places. i felt great afterwards."
47,5,Positive,"the place doesn't look the best but food is excellent and the service is fantastic!  my husband always gets pizza or open face roast beef n gravy. i get lasagna (which gives me 3meals) or a sandwich. my granddaughter's love to go there. they get there own personal pizza which is huge. big jim's was also on ""diners, drive in and dives"". guy showed the spaghetti being made, he gave the recipe. also, i forgot to mention they have the best wedding soup in pittsburgh."
48,5,Positive,"it's not that i'm 9 months pregnant that i was able to eat an entire pizza here, but that the pizza here is that good! first time trying it but will be back again (soon i hope)! very clean place, very friendly guys helping us with how to order and very good pizza (had i mentioned that?). many thumbs up cbp!!!"
49,5,Positive,not sure why all the bad reviews. i've been ordering pizza from this location for a decade and have never had a problem.
50,4,Positive,great pizza but lacks consistency. lots of toppings to choose  from. needs more choices  in dipping sauces.
51,4,Positive,best gluten free vegan pizza in the world!!!
52,5,Positive,"super delicious ! now i wish i could of taken a picture of the pizza and cheesesteaks. but they were gone before another thought came up. fresh ingredients, big slices and friendly staff. my new local go to spot for pizza !!"
53,5,Positive,"we headed in for lunch on a weekday, and were seated right away. our server's name was chris, and he was very prompt and courteous. we each ordered pizza and shared and it was fantastic! the diavallo and the boss were so good. the margherita wasn't bad either. i can't wait to go back and try some more!"
54,4,Positive,"we ate there friday night and it was an absolute delight.

scott the owner, the staff and the décor was very inviting.

the pizza was very good. the combination of the tasty crust, the right amount of sauce and a fresh mozzarella along with quality toppings makes it the best pizza i've had in arcadia area. it was even tasty the next day.

what i liked about it the most is that they're not trying to be a fancy place or going all snobby on the food as the arcadia area restaurants do way too much.  they obviously just want to be a pizza parlor offering a good pizza, at a fair price and they seem to be doing a good job of it.

they also have byob, you can bring in your own bottle of wine or beer and drink it with your food. i don't why but i find this kind of cool

we will definitely be back."
55,5,Positive,"i heard this place was good and it was. i ordered a personal sized cheese pizza with no extra toppings for $7.50. and it was good. they make it like pizza brutta on monroe st, where instead of being covered with a layer of cheese it has a few dollops. novonta pulls that off (pizza brutta did too). novonta's crust was good, and the rest of the pizza was even better. i really got just a plain cheese pizza, but there was more to it. some sort of basil or spinach leaves in there... i don't know but it was good. it also only took like 2 minutes to make."
56,4,Positive,"i have been going to the rwb in mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good.  as a vegetarian i have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but i typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad. the eggplant florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  that is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices.   i would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about. the only thing i will say is that i know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold... so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing.  if you are area, i would definitely recommend rwb."
57,5,Positive,"yes! i'm officially addicted to this pizza. honestly, the only good new york style pizza in madison. i'm originally from new jersey (yes, i am aware that is *not* new york) so i've missed a good thin crust.

so far, the eggplant pizza is my favorite. i mean, i've liked all the ones i had. i think the ratio of the ingredients is good.

i ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like i was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza i was going to consume. they give a good amount of salad! the feta in the mediterranean salad is super yummy, though on the salty side.

i went there again today, after ordering delivery yesterday. i don't plan on going tomorrow, but we will see."
58,5,Positive,staff is always nice and their pizza is awesome! the wings are good too! and so many other things! great place to eat.
59,5,Positive,"first time eating here and was very impressed with ""the cheef"" sandwich, great flavor. friends said the pizza was really good too."
60,4,Positive,"vegan options in downtown vegas!!! pizza was super tasty and the service was pretty decent. half way through baking my pie they remembered that i only wanted mushrooms on half, so they took it out of the oven and picked them off.  kind of weird, but whatever.  nice gesture, but paws off my pizza! lol."
61,5,Positive,authentic italian pizza made with fresh ingredients! do yourself a favor and place an order tonight! personally love the quattro formaggio pizza!
62,4,Positive,"after seeing hash house a go go on a food network show, my hubby wanted to go for the famous chicken and waffles for sunday brunch. 
we arrived around 10:40 and were immediately seated ina large booth in the corner. our friendly server came over right away and took drinks orders while explaining a few particularly popular many items. 
items chosen; chicken waffles (he loved it), apple-cinnamon pancake (yummy and seriously the size of a medium pizza!), kids hamburger (huge, said to be a little oily tasting), and egg white scramble with avocado and sweet potato fries (good). 
while the portions are easily large enough for 2 people to share, one will not be disappointed if comfort foods is your hankering."
63,4,Positive,"upper crust is like grimaldi's on steroids. the two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. upper crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which i am not crazy about. the wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey bbq sauce. the meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but stephanie h would disagree. happy hour is monday-friday 4pm to 7pm and on wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine. 

overall, it is a very good pizza and i plan on returning. next time i'll be giving that pizza cookie a try. i really liked upper crust, but grimaldi's in old town is still my favorite for traditional ny style thin crust pizza."
64,5,Positive,"i have to say that not only is the food amazing, the employees are extremely friendly. they went as far to fulfill my request to draw john snow from game of thrones (easily the best pizza place ever!) thank you so much!"
65,4,Positive,"ordered today for lunch for delivery to my workplace. my boss treated us to lunch since it was my birthday.  ordered online and delivery was 6 minutes later than they said it would be but all the food was correct and delicious!  i got a large supreme pizza, lots of wings, and a cookie for under $50 bucks and it fed the whole office.  delivery dude was nice."
66,5,Positive,this place is always great my husband and i love ordering from them not only are they extremely fast when it comes to delivery but they are super friendly their pizza is top notch whenever i take a bite i feel like i'm in italy! this is the place to order from if you don't feel like cooking and are too much of a bum to go outside :)
67,4,Positive,"excellent thin crust pizzas with great toppings and an ok selection of local craft beers. take away a giant slice for $5!

absolutely the most affordable dining option at aria. and the monopoly machines are right outside too!"
68,4,Positive,"giordano's is a great italian/chicago style restaurant that i highly recommend! the negative reviews on this place's wait times and busyness should not count against it. this restaurant just opened no more than 5 months ago, it is located on the busy p83 strip with tons of people and near the arrowhead mall, and is only a moderate sized restaurant. 
     when my husband and i first arrived we heard the wait was almost 2 hours but for a party of 5+ - for just me and my husband we were sat right away. large families/parties need to realize that places that have just opened up are going to be super busy and have long wait times - its common sense. we sat at a small side table and were not too shocked at how busy and compacted everyone was. we expected it and were happy to see all the buzz around the place. our waiter got our drinks immediately and walked us through the menu. he warned us about a large party that had just arrived and that we needed to put any pizza order in soon other wise it would be over an hour wait for a chicago style pizza. 
     my husband and i wanted to go a different route and ordered a pasta and sandwich instead. the wait time on the pizza was not a negative strike to us - we knew hand making a pizza from scratch takes time and we were more interested in the other dishes anyways. my husband ordered the italian beef sandwich and i ordered the marinara spaghetti while we shared the giordano's sampler. the food was fantastic and i'll be posting pictures of it too. it was rich and flavorful with a real taste of care and love. the only negative part of the meal was that everything came out all together and quite quickly. i believe my husband and i waited just over 10 minutes to get our appetizers, salads, and entrees. our table almost couldn't fit it all. i ended up having to not finish my salad because i did not want my entree to get cold. 
     other than that my husband and i had a great meal and really enjoyed the atmosphere. we also appreciated our waiter and his thoughts in items on the menu that were best for us and our time frame. i will definitely be back to have more from this delicious establishment - but with a party no larger than 3 i think for the next few months."
69,4,Positive,"tldr: great spot for a slice of late night pizza on de la montagne just under st. catherine. 

pizza chez danny makes tasty pizza that will squash your late night craving. the crust is thin and crisp on the bottom, but soft on top. the addition of sesame seeds on the top adds a delicious nuttiness to every bite of the sweet crust. the mixed cheese of the simple cheese pizza melts into yummy goodness and sits on a light dose of tomato sauce. with tax, the slice came out to around $3, and it was delicious. i definitely recommend this place for your americanized pizza itch."
70,4,Positive,"before you eat here you have to know that this restaurant has been around for 37 years! that is amazing for any restaurant. restaurants come and go, but this one has stood the test of time...and you""ll definitely notice that the decor, although clean and super comfortable, is understatedly retro.

i liked the vibe here. there's a fair sized restaurant area and a large lounge with a cozy brick fireplace. it's usually packed friday and saturday nights.

the owner's son played with the calgary stampeders once upon a time, so there's lots of stampeder memorabilia. it wouldn't be completely unrealistic to see some football players digging into some steaks while you're eating. 

my friends and i had pizza, greek salad and caesar salad. the greek salad was delicious and had some bonus creaminess to it. the caesar (large) was nice and garlicky and came with a generous side of garlic toast.

we had the ambrosia pizza (think spinach, artichoke hearts  feta) and the athenian pizza (think feta and olives). both had toppings that blended together in the most amazing way! i would order both again.

service was great - attentive, polite and friendly.

this restaurant has a solid menu; is comfortable and laid back; and has some friendly employees who obviously enjoy what they do."
71,5,Positive,"we came here before a concert at consol center. it's across the street, it was very packed, so leave yourself a lot of time to get a table if you want to eat here. we got lucky & got a table only hour before the concert!! we ordered a pizza & it was good for a bar. good selection of beers!!"
72,5,Positive,super yummy pizzas and salads! not a ton of seating area indoors. bar across the hall so you can get any drink you like.
73,4,Positive,"i have no idea of the history of this place, but it has one. they also use the same sourdough starter for the pizzas for about 50 years. the waitress explained this too me, but all i know is the pizza turned out pretty good. our version had giant pieces of pepperoni, a dabble of grilled jalapeno and purple onion. this not really ny style as i was barely able to fold the thing, but it was all about that sourdough crust. in a surprise though, the pizza did not taste good reheated. another surprise was the ""check in"" on facebook and get an order of chicken tenders for $2. these were small, hot and crunchy little tenders which were quite good. they have an upstairs with games and of course all the funky stuff is fun to check out. half the patio is covered also, so that is a good thing."
74,5,Positive,"we love black rock!!! this is the best place to get pizza!! we became fans when they were over on race st. now that they have more room it's even better!!! they also have live music, real pinball tables, and support local charities. my kind of place!!!!!"
75,5,Positive,"trying out a new greek place today and so happy i did! went to hummus for lunch. this is a great concept i like. blaze pizza did it and so does hummus. a chipotle style built your own bowl or wrap. lots of great options! i went with the bowl today and i loved it! delicious and the healthiest thing i've had in days, just a real feel good meal. i thought having hummus on the bottom would be weird, but i worked great. the lamb was wonderful and i love the whole scoop of feta. will definitely be back especially since it's so close to my place in anthem."
76,4,Positive,"pizza was pretty authentic, i am a new yorker so always looking for good pizza. also, tried the cannoli and it was awesome."
77,4,Positive,"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and i do admit the flavor is marginally better than caesar's $5 pizza. the only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking wet from being drenched in oil. 

alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals. the pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! it's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard."
78,5,Positive,"this is the best pizza i have ever eaten !!!!  amazingly fast, friendly delivery of the most amazing pizza ever !!!  there is no other pizza joint for me.  ahwatukee rocks!!!"
79,5,Positive,"great pizza, great price! 
always walk in here for a slice and a pop when i'm in the durham region for work. service is good and quick. pizza is delicious. they seem to doing a good business as a lot of people walk in to pick up their pizzas. price is very good, cheaper than most places."
80,4,Positive,"ordered the gluten free pesto party pizza. it was so delicious i ate the whole pizza save for one slice i gave to a co-worker. they lose a star because i felt nickel and dimed for everything. i ordered my pizza carry out and got charged for one ranch and hot peppers, and i almost got charged for a water cup because i wanted one with a lid but the guy behind the register was nice enough to just give it to me.  so after the gluten free crust (which i expect to pay extra for) and the little condiments, and tip i spent $18 on a personal pizza. a little on the pricey side for lunch."
81,5,Positive,"my wife and i are pizza snobs.  we've tried a lot of pizza places in the 10 years we've lived here and no one compares to rino d's.  they are just that good.  

we love the white pizzas and the chicken pesto.  they have good appetizers and the deserts are good.  the calzones are pretty good too, just a touch greasy.  we always order delivery.  they get here pretty fast (of course we live just a couple blocks away).  

i love all the coupons they have and their rewards program is awesome.  i've never received so many free pizzas anywhere in my life.   their delivery drivers are very nice, friendly and polite.  i highly recommend them.  but taste around first if you must.  you won't be disappointed."
82,5,Positive,"this pizza was great.  pizza sauce makes a good pizza and this was outstanding.  great service.  loved the ""chandelier"".  great experience."
83,5,Positive,"okay... another check in. there is no doubt this is one of my ""go to"" places to eat and i will continue to go back! on this visit i asked for a giant slice with extra sauce on top! in my previous reviews i already noted that the pizza is excellent! awesome crust, awesome cheese, and an amazing sauce. also worthy of noting that they are consistent... it's always awesome!

i know it's weird. lol i thought of asking for extra sauce on top because there is a place in brooklyn i used to go to all the time called l & b spumoni gardens. i know extra sauce is a boring for a pizza topping but let me tell you it was delicious!!!!!! mmmmm!! mmmm!! even this photo makes my mouth water!"
84,5,Positive,by far my favorite pizza in town! the deep dish is to die for and so is their service! i have eaten here countless times and have never been let down!
85,4,Positive,"pizza, pizza, pizza. love it. nello's is a good laid back place to get together with some family and/or friends and have lots of options for pizza and sald, and knock a few back. service is about 4 stars too."
86,5,Positive,"had lunch with my wife here.  she's colombian and felt it had some traditional colombian flavors with more modern simple dishes.  i mention the colombian part as there are really no restaurants close by with rice, beans, sweet plantains, empanadas, and steak.  was very good quick and attentive service.  for $5.99 she got the dinner portion with soup.  i tried the grilled chicken over salad with avocados beans and corn was delicious and will definitely go here again.   one of the reviews picked up food for take out and i understand his feelings as haven eaten many colombian meals prepared by her mom, her aunts, many places in florida, puerto rico and in dominican republic this food is just best eaten right away.  try it out, for the area it's great to have another option other than bbq, chinese, or pizza."
87,5,Positive,"peter piper is arizona's family oriented pizza chain. most people think the pizza is complete garbage and often describe it as cardboard, but i think it's just plain great."
88,5,Positive,"i used to work as a waitress at this restaurant's original incarnation (amelio's est. 1985) in 2003 when i was at university so i can you that not only is the food delicious, this is a lovely family restaurant that treats its staff very well. 

i thought they'd closed down so i was ecstatic when my boyfriend found out they reopened as amelia's with the daughter at the helm, how wonderful to see this awesome family business continue past its 30th year! i love supporting local companies and this is the real deal.

now on to the food! there's a reason that every crop of mcgill students learns of amelia's and quickly sees it as a staple. not only are the prices reasonable, it's byo and group-friendly for before a big night out. it was not uncommon when i worked there for groups of 8 to show up with a couple of boxes of wine and have a great time before hitting the night life. now i happen to prefer a better quality to drink myself, but love that this joint is casual enough to cater to that crowd and nice enough to suit my needs as a young professional as well. 

the white pizza (5-cheese) is a must. i highly recommend sharing one small, medium or large with your table as it's a little intense to eat alone but absolutely to die for. you must try it as nature intended, but a great hack from my waitressing days is to ask them to add tomato slices & garlic for even more flavour. just adding mushrooms is another fav. 

the florentine pizza with artichoke hearts and spinach is also amazing, and often gets overshadowed by the white but very subtle and delicious flavors. only available as a small, so bear that in mind! the vegetarian is delicious and has a sauce base that includes eggplant. the reuben pizza is basically a smoked meat sandwich in a pizza, complete with sauerkraut and mustard on the side - definitely not for the faint of heart but we'll worth it if you love meat and want the adventure. if you're a first-timer i'd definitely suggest splitting that with a more standard pizza,  though. or the white :)

you really can't go wrong with the pizzas, and any small can be done in whole wheat dough which is great if you wanna be a bit healthier. they aren't intended to be italian-style thin crust pizzas so do be aware of that. the crust is fluffy, buttery, almost pastry-like (i believe they use crisco shortening in the dough) so expect more of a new york style slice. i almost never eat crusts from pizzas but i always finish theirs, they're so good!! 

the little salads that come with each order are lovely and give you that valuable extra greenery before say, eating 5 melted cheese on dough!! and their subs and pastas are great too, but the pizzas really do shine here. 

if you get dessert, the cheesecake was always my favourite, and all desserts are made in-house.

note that it's cash only, so come prepared! one of my fav things to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at cinema du parc. they stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly.

you will have an awesome meal, promise :)"
89,4,Positive,my boyfriend and i came in here for the first time for dinner. i had lasagna and my boyfriend had the waiter by the name of jared build him a pizza it was very good and we had chicken wings. the restaurant was very clean but it felt a little warm in here. i would recommend this place to my friends. we will be back to try their chicken.
90,5,Positive,"good food in a great location inside the linq promenade. stumbled upon this place after walking all evening and was pleasantly surprised. great pizzas, amazing service. what more can you ask for?"
91,4,Positive,"pop up pizza was conveniently located next to the elevator going to my room, so of course i had to try it. if you're staying at plaza, look out for their coupon too! my welcome booklet came with a deal on two slices of cheese and a drink, but i just asked if i could pay a little extra for toppings.

the storefront is cool looking and they were playing a lot of dubstep...probably because it was edc week. the workers there were friendly, and even though there is no soda fountain outside, you can still get free refills of your drink by asking.

i got a slice of their white chapel pizza (ricotta and spinach) as well as a generic meat lovers. the white chapel is sooo goooood! the other one was tasty too, but i preferred the white chapel despite the lack of meat. the slices are pretty big, and i really liked the crisp yet chewy crust. dare i say i liked it better than secret pizza, a vegas joint on the strip that also has ny style pizza? what they have on this place is location, but pop up pizza is cheaper, faster, and equally (if not more) delicious. 

food: 4, service: 4, environment: 4, price: 3"
92,5,Positive,"this pizza has a good amount of sauce, and it is very flavorful, giving it a homemade feeling. the crust is delicious, too. we mostly order the pizza and cheese bread. i'm not crazy about this style of garlic bread they make, as it hardens quickly, but their cheese bread is phenomenal and somehow tastes even better as leftovers."
93,5,Positive,"went in on memorial day, no complaints! quick service, good selection. right next to it is a brewery with beer & wine selections that you can eat at too. i had the pizza special (ratatouilli sp?) & added a fried egg !"
94,4,Positive,"i really enjoyed this restaurant. in fact, i went there twice during my stay. mostly for the pizza. i had a fig and artichoke pizza, and added chicken. it was so dang tasty! it was not overly sweet, as you might imagine. it had a perfect blend of tastes. i crave it all the time. the specialty cocktails were very expensive for drinks. my friends had a mango mohito, and said that they were awesome. the service was good. the atmosphere is great. it was very busy at all, which i couldn't understand, but it was overall a great experience. highly recommended for a reasonably priced, nice meal (reasonably prices for vegas, that is)."
95,5,Positive,"first time tonight. staff super friendly, service great, and pizza was fantastic!  we've found a new hangout!  can't wait to try something else for dinner."
96,4,Positive,"from time to time, my family enjoys a good pizza.  however, the gluten free options are very limited for my youngest son and myself.  we have ordered from dominos, which is really gross.

streets of new york was introduced to us about a year ago.  we have been back several times when we want to have a pizza treat.  we love the food.  

the only issue we have is the wait is often very long for our food and the wait staff seems is always a little on the blah side.  a smile, every once in awhile would be nice.  

we will continue to come back, but i would recommend the wait staff perk up a bit, often you look like you (all) hate being there."
97,5,Positive,"we ordered takeout tonight and absolutely loved it.  we had a couple of deep dish pizzas, a gluten free pizza, a salad, some wings, and the cheese curds.  everything was delicious!  also, the service picking up the food was excellent.  everyone was very friendly and the food was ready on time."
98,4,Positive,"by the slice is one of the best pizza places i been to.  it is a small place nicely tucked away in the plaza.  i order here at least once a month for lunch with my co-workers.  they always have killer deals such as 2 medium speciality pizza for $16.99 - their specialy pizzas are amazing as they have around 5-6 toppings on it. southwest chicken and meat combo are my fave.  if you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  ex-large margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $9.99.  they surpising also have amazing fried chicken almost like kfc.  i actually like it more than kfc and it is cheaper as well.  10 huge chicken pieces and medium wedges for only $12.99.  only thing bad is the plaza parking is horrible as it shared with wendy's, starbucks,kelsey and mr. greek.  can't wait to order from them this friday."
99,5,Positive,"i absolutely love this place. i moved to the peoria area about 7 months now and i was trying to find that one really good local pizza joint and i finally found it a few months ago! this place has such a unique place, you can have the exact pizza you love and as fresh as possible because it's baked in your own oven. they use fresh ingredients, awesome sauce and it's pretty affordable ply they have this stamp card so after so many purchases you can get a free family size! i highly recommend this place for any family looking for some good fresh pizza that won't break the bank in the process"
100,4,Positive,"it's pretty difficult to find good pizza in las vegas. it's even more difficult to please 2 east coast people that know their pizza. so when my husband and i say that this is good stuff, we really mean it. 

we love the to-go window where you can order by the slice and even an entire pie. let's be honest, it's the perfect stop after a night of drinking."
101,5,Positive,"yuummmmm!!! we went here to eat after the high roller and got the garlic cheese bread appetizer and classic pepperoni pizza...our first time there, all the food was amazing!  we sat on the patio and when it started raining the waiters came over immediately and helped us move everything to a covered table.  definitely going there for pizza next time we make a vegas trip."
102,5,Positive,"i really enjoyed this place on my recent visit to the aria casino. it's located near the sports book, which was a plus for me.  the pizza was great and they had a nice selection of local craft beer, which was nice since i was visiting from out of town.

5 stars all the way!"
103,5,Positive,"we live in the neighbourhood and decided to go for an early dinner with our two young daughters.  we arrived at around 5:30 on a saturday and there was plenty of space - the tables were filling up when we were leaving though.  i love, love, love that it is very kid friendly while still having amazing grown up food.   they have a kids menu, crayons and a little play area in the corner with some toys and a chalkboard wall.  my girls both had the kids salami pizza and my only complaint would be that the salami was too spicy - we picked it off and they ate their cheese pizza happily.  my husband and i both had pizzas and they were very good - thin crispy crust and large portions.   our waiter was very friendly and the food arrived hot and quickly.  we will definitely be back - maybe for a date night without the kids next time."
104,5,Positive,amazing pizza for $10 and half price apps between 4-6 weekdays. can't recommend this place enough. all pizza recipes that we've tried are perfectly balanced and full of high quality ingredients.
105,5,Positive,"we found this place by doing a search on yelp.  we ordered a sal's special pizza and an order of bread with cheese.  the food and service was great.  the price was great for what we received.  we will be back when we are in the area.  

this place has a lot going for it.  the atmosphere inside is nice and it is like stepping away from the busy area just outside its doors.  it was clean and comfortable and very relaxing.  the service was great and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu."
106,4,Positive,"flour & barley is located on the linq promenade.  this place has really good wood fire pizzas.  you can buy the pizza by the slice at the stand right next to the restaurant.  if you want to try their specialty pizzas, you will have to order from the restaurant.

 each pizza is about 11 inches, and the crust is really thin.  i recommend people to get their own pizzas instead of sharing.  i got to try the mushroom pizza and it was one of my favorites.  there was a decent amount of mushrooms.  i also tried the big apple pizza, which is just spicy pepperoni.  this was also tasty.

overall, great place to get pizzas.  the staff is very nice and friendly to their customers.  i would definitely come back!"
107,4,Positive,i love the idea and execution of custom made pizzas.  the pizza was delicious and it was ready in less than 5 minutes.  i am a fan of this place and will be back.  the place is cool and happy.
108,5,Positive,we love their margarita pizza!  their delivery service is always fast and their food is amazing.  highly recommend!
109,5,Positive,"decided to eat here again because i was craving the cheesy deliciousness and received a coupon in the mail for $10 off a $30 order. 

placed a to-go order. the pizza was ready by the time i got there and was a great price with the coupon. the pizza is amazing! i can't stop eating it. because of the thickness of the pizza, you can eat two slices and be full. recommend sharing a large with 3 other people or saving it for leftovers. i think it tastes even better the next day after being warmed up in the microwave."
110,4,Positive,"i've had bad experiences at other pizza hut shops, but this one always gives me well made pizzas. pizza is always fresh, never burnt, always done by the time i get there. there's always people in there so i'm assuming they feel the same way. try the stuffed crust and crust toppers."
111,5,Positive,this hip pizza and beer spot has a live dj at the bar.  pizzas are light and delicious. staff is fantastic.  be sure to ask for the free hot peppers olive oil mix...mmm!  place was so great we went here twice on our 4-day vacation to montreal.
112,5,Positive,"so all the round table pizza chains in vegas shut their doors and removed their signs... damn shame if you ask me as i was born and raised in the bay and round table has always been my favorite franchise of pizza. damn. so after driving to their location on sahara and ft apache with a craving for pizza just to find it closed i suggested hitting up custom built as it's been on my to do list for quite some time and we were set on pizza.

true to all their reviews and advertisement you pretty much build your own pizza from their selection of crusts and toppings. 

i've been here twice back to back. first time i got a half and half of buffalo chicken and bbq chicken with a few add toppings and they turned out great.

second time i tried to 'layer' the flavors by asking them to make rings of sauce on the crust before cheese and toppings are added. the result wasnt as i was expecting and i realized they dont put a lot of sauce because it makes the pie soggy.

i expect to be coming here frequently to try out the different combinations of pies."
113,4,Positive,"great newyork style pizza, crust and dough is really good. lunch with the slice and salad and drink is so bomb for like 4 bucks, maybe the cheapest lunch in town and it good, not just something you eat cause its cheap, you will want to go back again! wings are good and so are the fried mushroom and zucchini sticks."
114,4,Positive,"the pizza here is pretty standard, nothing special but decent. i am a huge fan of the hot cookies though. that is what this review is for. i don't usually come to oregano's unless i know i am getting a hot cookie for dessert. my favorite is the chocolate chip which comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. best to share with a friend is it is rather large."
115,4,Positive,"one of the best pizza places in old montreal. this place is packed during the weekend, so don't forget to make reservations in advance. the ambiance here is trendy. a fancy cast iron chandelier hangin, 80's music playing in the background, what's not to like about this place.  we ordered the arancino, antipasti, meatballs and pizza's. the arancino's are delish. deep fried risotto balls crispy on the top and soft inside, topped with meat sauce.   antipasti was ok. meatballs were delicious too. now for the pizza's........not one of  the best pizza's i've had, but they were good. we tried the bosco in bianco, capriciosa & cotto e bocconcini.  the crust is flavorful. woodfire makes these pizza's delicious, though i prefer the crust to be a bit extra burnt.  the capriciosa was interesting as i'd never had a boiled egg on the pizza. it actually tastes really good. also ask for the spicy oil. that adds a lot of flavor to it.
definitely worth a visit ...... again & again...... at least for the arancino's  


food -  good
service - friendly
ambiance - trendy
worth the money - aw yissss"
116,5,Positive,don't want to say too many things positive as i don't want it to get too crowded.  great pizza and salads. very neighborly! highly recommend.
117,5,Positive,"if you have never been here, they will bring you a free sample of their wings. great salad and great service. highly recommend the eggplant pizza. the dough is made fresh! the salad pizza looks good, although i haven't tried it."
118,4,Positive,"it's not the best pizza ever, not the best in the strip. for the best pizza i would probably go to grimaldi's at the venetian. but this is good, quality pizza. tasteful and quite convenient if you are at the aria. 

for a quick bite, it gets the job done. you won't be disappointed, especially if you are already inside the aria. the slices are large and you can get your pizza and pay in about two minutes."
119,4,Positive,"good service, and $5 for a large ny style slice of pizza and beer is a pretty damn good deal.  note: that happy hour deal is only for 2 or 3 of the beers on draft."
120,4,Positive,"really a fun place.  great atmosphere, attentive and friendly servers and very good pizza and wings.

the only reason i would not give it a 5 star rating was that they were out of three of the beers i really wanted to try.

definitely still a place i highly recommend."
121,5,Positive,"great pizza!! this place was a great last minute pick!! 
we decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! the service was great!! we had a friendly and patient server with our undecided group. also we loved the surprisingly good tasting white sauce on our pizzas!! everything was amazing!! the mozzarella appetizers and the extreme hot wings!! oh so good, fatty food!! we look forward to coming back!!"
122,5,Positive,"yummmmm! 
the atmosphere is so comfortable, i especially love the patio area where we like to enjoy a glass of wine and a couple of appetizers. the food is excellent especially the pizza and i think its hard to find good pizza!! this is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family......we do both :)
great food at an excellent value with wonderful service! what more could you possibly want."
123,5,Positive,"finally made a visit to lucille this past weekend and i can't wait to go back!  i'd heard mixed reviews on the pizza but honestly that's crazy!  that being said everything pales in comparison to their nachos...seriously...they are the best nachos i've ever had!  their drinks are out of this world (which was expected since they're a merchant step-sister) and the lounge in the basement is a must for after dinner socializing (tip: order the mexican firing squad)!  way to go lucille, yet another killer restaurant added to madison!"
124,5,Positive,"bartender, jerry, took great care of me. he recommended the date/jalapeño pizza. incredible! highly recommended!!"
125,4,Positive,"the happy hour gang i hang out with frequents this place often.  it's hard to find a decent martini in cleveland, but i have to say they know how to shake an excellent one here.

i've been here a few times and the food has been consistently delicious every time.  the pizzas really stand out.  they're half price during happy hour.  oh and they're also a little smaller than the full priced fare, but they are still delicious.

the rest of the menu looks really delicious, but i don't know how many people know they have a full menu.  people may think this is a bar only, yet there appear to be some really nice entrees as well.  i'll need to come back and try those.

during warmer weather, this is one of the best patios around.  i really want this place to succeed.  this location has been cursed by so many failed restaurants.  in my opinion, this place should be around for a long time.  it's nice to have a classier, unpretentious wine and martini bar on the west side of town."
126,5,Positive,"i absolutely love their pizza and drive out of my way to get it, closest thing i have found to real new york style pizza. i would highly recommend the sausage."
127,5,Positive,"awesome, well-priced pizza. tasty, cheap snacks (arancini). beautiful space - the decor is phenomenal for a counter-service place. much higher-end all around (quality of food, quality of ambience) than you'd expect for the price point - even the napkins were high-class! a phenomenal addition to downtown. go there immediately!"
128,5,Positive,"about ten years ago i searched for a pizza place that taste like the ones we have in michigan. and, we have our share of great pizza shops in the mid west. i was told about beach pizza, went there, and have never been disappointed with their pizza. it is my ""special treat"" when i need one. they are fast, friendly, and the price doesn't make you feel like you are back in california. beach, i love your pizza."
129,5,Positive,we love the theme of oregano's. super cozy to come here on a date. we ordered parmesan chicken with caesar salad and enjoyed it so much! would totally recommend this place to anyone! we've come here on multiple events with big groups and just me and my husband at times and the customer service here never let us down. super friendly waiters and great food and will never go bad. also they have really good thin crust pizza
130,4,Positive,"when i saw this place show up as a hot new business on the yelp frontpage, i thought it was a bit of a silly name.  but it tells you everything you need to know about the business.  think subway/chipotle (custom built sandwich/burrito) assembly line style ordering, but for pizza.  $8.95 gets you a 12-inch pizza with all the toppings you want.  according to their website:

(4) kinds of sauces
(4) kinds of cheeses, which you can combine together
(7) kinds of meats
(7) kinds of veggies
(7) kinds of toppers, added after the pizza is cooked

who else sells you a (potentially) 25-topping pizza for $8.95?!  i don't know if i would try it.  except that i totally would if i could order it without feeling like a bit of a jerk.  once you order your pie, you'll have it within minutes; these cook fast.  10 minutes after setting foot into the restaurant i had my food!

for my very first custom built pizza i had the spicy diavola sauce, fresh mozzarella, italian sausage, mushroom, garlic and sun dried tomatoes (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ceqwpwhboaxwrcv5btnv6g?select=zg2bak39zop7m6bmzmaf7q#tqe5lahn7spzzw2mlvafag).  i can still taste the spicy diavola and garlic in my breath, and i'm quite okay with that.  no gum for me, i'm still enjoying my pizza.  tasty ingredients all around, and the crust keeps a chewy consistency with a slight crunch.  

you want to ask me out for dinner?  how the heck are you gonna do that?  you can build me a pizza or something.  i am a fan and i will most definitely be back."
131,4,Positive,"while shopping in the strip, we wanted to grab a quick bite for a late lunch. we stopped in and i got two slices of pepperoni pizza. the slices were enormous, covered in pepperoni and piping hot. i'm normally more of a thick crust fan, but the crispy thin crust here was on point. i scarfed down my two slices, which were probably more like four slices of normal sized pizza, and headed back out the door. 

will definitely be back for another slice, or three."
132,4,Positive,"i've been coming to this sauce for quite a while and its consistently good. i don't think i've ever had a bad experience because i always know what to expect.

the pizza is good, salads are solid, and the mac n' cheese...well, lets just say i'm a sucker it. every time we come to eat here the service is friendly and helpful, probably the best i've had from a ""fast casual"" type of restaurant.

i definitely recommend sauce if you're looking for something fairly quick but delivers on quality."
133,4,Positive,"i enjoy pizza hut but i personally dont like the oversized chicken and i know its not them but all i ordered was chicken but the kids loved the pizza and the mild chicken. they were 5,7, & 2."
134,4,Positive,came in during lunch. pretty busy inside but nice atmosphere has a really nice patio seating area. got the garlic knots as an appetizer very good! got the margarita pizza with sausage on it super yummy!
135,5,Positive,"honestly this was so good. i have eaten there twice in one week. the pizza was amazing and then we went back for pasta. seriously the service was wonderful and the food yum. but the price was the best part. we had wine, appetizers, salad and full entrees and the bill was ....wait for it....$48 bucks. whoohoo."
136,5,Positive,"awesome place. visited from california... wish we had something like this place here. got the fontina burger one day and the bbq chicken pizza the next. the ""grilled"" pizza has an awesome charred taste.

wish i could have tried the apple fritters but i walked up to the counter at 11:01 and they had stopped serving breakfast. they should really serve those all day long."
137,4,Positive,"when you have three kids under 10 and a 4 month old (aunt duty), cooking dinner is the last thing on your mind. at least for the inexperienced over here lol. 

i wanted to try something new, so i found the closest ny pizza place to my house. ordered two large pizzas with garlic balls (12) and was happy with the order. the pizza was made perfect. my only complaint is that i had to wait even when i arrived over thirty minutes past the time given for the food to be ready."
138,4,Positive,"had their pizza, that was awesome.  it was one loaded up with stuff that i can't remember, but it was fab.

went back tonight and was a tad disappointed in what came with the gyro platter.  some good places that i've been to put a little medley of things, which it had but was just olives, and those green things that end in cini.  there's a place in seattle that i have yet to find which compares.  these guys put rice, hummus, feta, olives, tzatziki, and a small greek salad on the side which you can make an awesome wrap with!  and there was more portion for the same price. the meat was good, and everything was good, but i won't order that again.  seattle's ruined me.  if you are ever in seattle, you must go to mr. gyro's.  i will confidently say that you will not find anyone who makes them better, if so, you got damn lucky!"
139,5,Positive,"i am a big big fan of a good piece of pizza...this is some real good pizza. good sauce, awesome crust. laid back atmosphere to the restaurant. good service. overall i am very pleased with this restaurant."
140,5,Positive,"kicker's pizza is a brook park treasure!! the wings are amazing and the chicken philly is quite possibly the perfect sandwich. the homemade blue cheese should be sold in stores, too. the pizza is made from scratch - no frozen crusts or canned sauce. it's the real deal. try the wing pizza or the blt pizza for something unique."
141,4,Positive,"this pizza was very flavorful!  we got an all meat one and we were not disappointed.  
we got back to our room at excalibur at around 11:45 after seeing britney spears.  we were starving and decided to call this place.  it was delivered in 45 minutes.  not bad.  it tasted home-made, and the delivery man was a nice man.  
i lived everything about our experience, except for the fact that the woman on the phone who took my order was short in her words, giving me a bit of attitude.  that's the only reason i am not giving a 5-star rating."
142,5,Positive,"great pizza, hands down awesome crust and toppings. we had the forager and the balance between mushrooms meatiness and spinach earthiness was spot on. good service and modest price makes this is a winner choice. arugula and delicate squash salad was very unique and not too sweet in spite of the cranberry purée and citrus dressing. give it a try if you are in the mood to try something different."
143,5,Positive,"got a flyer on our door so we thought we'd give them a try... glad we did! we took advantage of their ""anytime party special"" of 2 pizzas, garlic balls and a soda. excellent crust- hand tossed but not too thick and chewy. great texture and flavor! garlic balls were also good- i like a little more garlic flavor, but they were definitely good! we will explore other items they offer in the future!"
144,4,Positive,"i live in cleveland but this store is close to cleveland so they deliver in my area. good pizza, a wide variety on the menu and the price point is spot on. the pizza crust is fresh and the ingredients are fresh as well. i have had the chicken wrap several times and it is huge and enough for two meals. it is fresh chicken and has a great flavor. one time the wrapper was on the dry side though. so next time i order i will mention that . i have had the chicken tenders and they were good as well. they offer a variety of sandwiches hot and cold, chicken wings, pasta dinners, desserts and of course pizza. the shrimp alfredo dinner was very good and had a nice flavor. the sauce was not on the thick side.  i had the pasta dinner with sausage and mushrooms and it was very very good. i have had the cheesecakes there and they are not home made but ok when you have a sweet tooth.  the deliveries are very quick. i went to the actual store and it was clean and i watched them prepare the food and they used gloves. they are always friendly and polite. the store is located off lorain road closer to the fairview bridge and kamn's corner area.  there is plenty of parking and you can bike there if you want."
145,5,Positive,bruno was recommended to us by a good friend and they did not stear us wrong.  one of the best pizzas we have had in a long time.   the sauce was so good and the staff was great.  on little surprise was the cesar salad. the owner shared that they make all their own dressings so we had to give it a try spook good. give bruno a try and the only problem you'll have is trying to figure out when to return to try something different.
146,4,Positive,"it's been awhile since my first visit to charbar when it first opened and although i didn't have the best experience that time around, i must say that i've truly enjoyed my last three visits here! all of them have been for their brunch or lunch service. i've been able to try the deep fried french toast bites, bagna cauda, asado plate, jamon crudo pizza, and during big taste their feature breakfast burger.

today i ordered one of the lunch features which was a pizza that featured roasted chicken and crispy chicken skin on top! like what, who does that?! the crispy chicken skin is what sold me and i definitely thought it finished off the pizza so well. their pizza dough by the way is bomb because it comes from sidewalk citizen =) our server today was lovely (i wish i remembered his name, i am the worst at that!) he was very personable and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal. and just a small thing that i noticed was that more than one person (that didn't include our server) ensured that we always had water in our glass. i appreciate that attentiveness because it really shows that they work as a team.

p.s. their beef fat fries are amazeballs! they are the type of fries that you can't stop eating no matter how full you are.

reserving my last star for when i am able to go back and try their dinner menu again, but if my last few visits indicate anything, i'm sure it won't be hard to give =)"
147,4,Positive,"in the past, there were spans when i would order pizza way too often. lately, i've been eating a lot healthier...though, i'm not made of stone.

of the delivery pizza places, i like pizza hut the most. their on-line ordering feature is extremely intuitive, allowing you to visually customize your exact order.

this particular location just so happens to be the one assigned to deliver to my location. in the short time i've lived here, i've always had pleasant experiences with the delivery people. they always seem to be happy, and are decently engaged. also, they always seem to arrive early or on-time...which is kind of important.

all in all, the via linda pizza hut is a reliable choice for a decent pizza in my opinion.

if you're looking for a tasty break from the normal pizza, try a thin crust chicken + jalapeno...but be warned...i think pizza hut harvests some of these peppers from the center of the sun. not all of them...but there are a few that make you sniffle something fierce."
148,5,Positive,with having three kids in the house we differently eat a lot of pizza. by far the best pizza i have had in the area. we moved in a couple blocks away and this will for sure be a walking distance dinner spot for us. oh and the wings amazing. first place i have asked for extra crispy and they understood what i meant!!! loved it! and the fact that its family owned and they are super nice just made it even better.
149,5,Positive,"a place that delivers in gilbert? yes, yes, yes!!! i wasn't certain while using the app for delivery whether it was accurate or not. i've spent the past 9 months in gilbert with very limited delivery options. when i say limited, i mean, there's been but a couple pizza joints to order from.

i'm not really a pizza enthusiast so, i've starved many late nights for this reason. 

i always check just to see if there have been changes. well, two places apparently deliver. in my disbelief, first thing i did was call to check since they appeared to be a little ways away. the gentleman was very kind on the phone in confirming they'd come out to us. i used the app to place my order because i feel it's much easier that way. therefore i was basing it off of the menu on here. i ordered samosas for the kid, a combo beef shrimp kabob platter for the man, a side of kabuli style rice and the vegetable qorma. i was so excited! within minutes i received a call from the restaurant to inform me they no longer served the vegetable qorma, and so went with the spinach qorma instead.

honestly, the call alone was a very noble move on their end. not to mention, i just checked to see what it was that i ordered and it appears that the menu has already been updated on the yelp app so, kudos for that as well!

although the wait time was closer to the 75 minute mark, the order arrived still hot and correct. 

that rice? so so so so so good! i didn't try much of anyone else's dishes and can't speak to much more other than they looked appealing and no one complained. the 7 year old didn't even make a stink about this foreign item that she devoured. i may have skipped the extra side had i realized my dish came with some but i had it today, four days later, for lunch and it was still off the chain. 

we will definitely order from here again and i will definitely tell all of the neighbors about the place!"
150,4,Positive,this might be the best pizza i have ever eaten. new york style thin crust with high quality ingredients on top. they have thick crust selections as well. new york theme and decor. very friendly and good service. the place is packed in the evening even on weekdays. superb price/value on food and drinks. located across 215 about 20 minutes from the strip in the suburbs of las vegas. if you go by cab be prepared to wait a long time for one to pick you up.  there are not many destinations for cab drivers in this part of vegas so they do not like driving one way without a fare to pick you up.
151,5,Positive,"this pizza is absolutely delicious. we are in town for a work/pleasure trip and  went based on other yelp recommendations and were not dissappointed. their red pizza was a perfect blend of crust, sauce and cheeses. very tasty. we also ordered a white pie with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms ( i don't know that they were canned, but they seemed to be precooked) and sweet white onions.  the crust was smeared with a sort of garlic oil spread, then the toppings and finished with a blend of cheeses. it arrived perfectly cooked and piping hot from the oven.  there are a few booths in the back with a sort of help yourself drink set-up. the staff could not have been any friendlier. this will be our go to pizza place the next time we are in pittsburgh!"
152,4,Positive,"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. i really haven't found a pizza i can devote myself to in this area. 

the garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. we really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in. very tasty pepperoni and parmesan recipe. 

the regular crust pizza we ordered for carry out next time was pretty good too, but not as good as the thin.

some of the specialty pizzas really looked good. can't wait to try them. 

it's not coccia house, but what is."
153,4,Positive,we came for sunday lunch. no one here but thats fine with us. service was great. ordered pizza and 8pc chicken combo. 4 of us enjoyed and had leftovers for the week. food is amazing. best chicken ever. kfc who?
154,5,Positive,"this is our favorite pizza place in las vegas for more than 10 years now. we just keep coming back!may it be for lunch, dinner or party! yummy pizza, fries, gyros, phily cheesesteak and many more! my kids love their meat lovers and chicken alfredo pizza. ben, the owner is awesome too!  may it be dine in, pick up, take out or delivery... you wont be disappointed!"
155,4,Positive,"this is one of the better lunch spots in scottsdale. any salad and any pizza for a flat price (i think $9). very reasonable. great atmosphere, easy parking, fast service. so many salad and pizza options you will never get bored."
156,4,Positive,"good hot dog, great fries and the best pizza puff in the state! we just ordered a few things but will be back for more."
157,4,Positive,just finished lunch.  the atmosphere was very pleasant.  the food was really good.  i had a custom pizza and feel that it was reasonably priced.  the service was fine and the food came out in a timely fashion.  i was somewhat reticent to go after reading the pther yelp reviews but experienced none of the conditions depicted in previous reviews.  the fact that they all menyioned yhe same vompetitor makes me wonder if there aren't some shenanigans going on.  my advice is to try it if you like brick oven thin crust pizza.  you won't be disappointed.
158,5,Positive,4.5/5! definitely one of toronto's best kept secrets when it comes to thin crust pizza! recommend the antipasti minto to start and the famous bufalina pizza (large enough to share depending on appetite)!
159,4,Positive,"cool place.  took my wife and son to the recline and dine (movies.) overall, pretty cool spot to check a flick.  prices are decent, the place is clean, and comfortable.  i like the idea of reclining on a chair.  seats recline and food is served here.  based on previous reviews i was afraid to order food from their pizza place so i have no opinion on the food.  the movie experience was great though."
160,5,Positive,"i can't say enough good things about piola. i moved into the building late last year and have probably visited the restaurant, or had take out, close to 10 times already. eating in the staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. taking out they are always fast.

must endorse the san danielle pizza - fresh mozzarella with parma ham, mmmm and do not forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. the diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. the crust here is right up there with terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower.

would also endorse the spaghetti and meatballs, so so tender the meatballs fall apart with a fork and the pasta is perfectly cooked with fresh curls of parmesan all over the top. 

look for the great daily specials - wednesdays is half price bottles of wine! so awesome. i believe kids eat free on sundays too."
161,4,Positive,"discovered tryst (organic) cafe shortly after it opened about 2+ yrs ago. have had breakfast, lunch & dinner there. they have organic everything - food, beer, wine, even vodka - which is what drew me at first. also many gluten free choices.

they've had their ups & downs with service, but it's usually good. the happy hour is limited and should be improved in both hours & choices.

my wife & i both love their seered ahi tuna salad, it's fantastic! we both want and need a good organic cafe in the area and hate to see the pizza place next door packed while the healthy restaurant is lightly filled. help tryst thrive!"
162,5,Positive,great food and fast delivery. highly recommend the chicken cesar pizza. yum yum yum!!
163,4,Positive,"ordered sushi pizza and extra salmon sushi combo.  food came quickly and the quality of the salmon in the sashimi was very good.   food quality was good, portions reasonable, and prices are reasonable.  good place to come for a quick meal."
164,4,Positive,"stopped in on a sunday afternoon and i could not resist a slice of pizza and a beer for $5. it turned out to be a good choice. i liked the pizza. it has a crispy crust and they really load up the toppings. it's also a very large slice of pizza. i was pleasantly full after just one slice. not that it stopped me from ordering a second slice.

we also tried the bruschetta appetizer, which was quite good. the serve a bowl of the mixed up toppings with a generous portion of toasted crostini. my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. not a big deal, really.

i'll be back."
165,5,Positive,"my boyfriend and i heard about this place from a friend so we decided to try it out. food and service was awesome! we had tyler as our server; he was super nice and just the right amount of attentive. he also was really knowledgable about their beer list as well as the menu.

we ordered a lot more food then we could have finished, but it was all amazing. the chicken wings with fries as delicious (i'd take a giant bowl of the fries alone because they were addictive), garlic buns (easily a meal in itself) that were actually garlicky, and we got the smallest size ""back home"" pizza (i think that's what it was called) which we took half home for leftovers.

definitely recommend naked city tavern. it's nice to have a place to just relax with good beers and good food locally."
166,5,Positive,"what a wonderful find! delicious, inventive, hand-crafted food, together with warm & welcoming service in a fun downtown locale. we enjoyed everything we tried, and since there were four of us and we did everything family style, we tried a lot! highlights included the beets & gnudi, the mushroom polenta, the cacio e pepe, the butternut squash agnotti, and the butterscotch dessert. the bacon/onion/egg pizza and crispy pancetta cavatelli were also great. thanks to eric for superb service and to james, the chef, for creating a truly terrific restaurant and coming out to chat with us. we'll be back again and again."
167,4,Positive,"the pizza was good but a little cold, delivery took longer than expected, but all in all the pizza was good. i will highly recommend if you are a fan of good pizza."
168,5,Positive,"great restaurant! great service and great pizzas! consistently good service and excellent food. great beers on tap. friendly staff and decent prices.
will continue to go back!!"
169,5,Positive,"guy's pizza co. coventry location has an average of 2.5 stars, say what?! i can't believe these 1 and 2 star reviews!? i have always experienced friendly and fast service at this guy's pizza location. although i have to admit the only time i go here is before i go to a show at the grog shop. i'd have to say i like the nyc small pizza joint vibe. the place is always filled with hs kids hanging out, laughing, and eating. 

it has been my tradition ever since guys opened on coventry rd and the grog moved to its south coventry rd location - that before a show i get a slice of pizza and a can of tahitian treat for only $2.75!

on this particular evening before the chelsea peretti - america treasure tour show. i went in for my ritual slice & can of tt. and there was no more tt!!! i was sadden by the lack of product and the counter girl shared my disappointment. i reluctantly ordered a sprite. as i left the manager came in with a whole bunch of tahitian treats -and the counter girl gave me one on the house!! granted it's only $0.75 but, it was the thought that counted and for that i give them 5 stars!!!!

by the looks of the other reviews they don't do delivery or big orders well. so, i say if you want a quick bite while shopping, walking around coventry, or before a show this the place to go!"
170,5,Positive,this is the best pizza & pasta dishes at the lake by far. this place is the real deal starting with the new york atmosphere &  making you feel at home from the start. great food at at very modest price. you will have food left over to take home. the meatballs & sauces are  delicious & all the breads / desserts are made daily  right there. italian food at its finest...
171,4,Positive,"i was craving pizza on friday and decided to stop by. i normally order takeout and have ordered from this place three times previously. my go to is a medium pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and tomato but this time i decided to try out the pizza and wings combo. fridays are busy and my wait time was 45mins. previous visits were a 15min wait. 

a steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their order and they all greeted the owner by name so i guess they are regulars. another thing i noticed was that a customer that came in and ordered 15mins after me received her order before me so i don't know if she received special treatment because she's a regular or that my pizza just took longer to cook lol. 

the pizza here have always been perfectly cooked and the crust crispy and this time it was no different. the wings on the other hand were disappointing and lacking. they were on the smaller end and for a couple dollars more, i would rather get wings at all stars.  

whenever i have a pizza craving, i'll come back."
172,5,Positive,"great food, great vibe. had cheese pizza, risotto with spinach, chilis, and sweet potato, and amazing sangria. we went during the day, and the vibe was very laid back and comfortable for all (my husband and i went with our 2 and 6 yr old, and met up with other family members, adults and kids, and we all had a blast). walked by later that night and clearly this is the place to be. will be returning as soon as i come back to town."
173,5,Positive,california dreamin pizza and meatball calzone were fresh and perfectly baked.  loved the fried dough with powdered and cinnamon sugar.  service was wonderful.  both the girls working were polite and helpful.
174,4,Positive,"good thin crust pizza. we had the dough knots as an appetizer, the 10-inch popeye pie for dinner and took home a slice of the italian creme cake. can't complain -- all was tasty. best part? the price. the cake was somewhat of a splurge ($6.50, but the slice is huge) - otherwise, it would have been a $12 dinner for two. 

we'll be back to try more pizzas.

we were there early for dinner on a wednesday and it was not crowded (not shocking...). our order was taken at a table, though several people came in to order to-go and went straight to the counter."
175,5,Positive,i was amazed by how well the pizza tasted ! my favourite was the goat cheese with sundried tomato & mint. a unique combination which was delicious. the owner was friendly with great customer service.  a definitely a must go to!!!
176,4,Positive,"this place is my go-to pizza delivery joint. ordering via grubhub, my delivery is consistently on time, accurate, and hot. in the many times i've ordered from little nippers i have never had a bad order.
their pizza is pretty tasty for pittsburgh standards. hoagies are on point!
their prices are really reasonable--they're a great go-to when ordering out!"
177,5,Positive,"the best chicago style pizza in town! being from the east coast, that should say a lot"
178,5,Positive,we are delivery junkies for this place.  i think the large cheese pizza is amazing and we crave it all the time!  i am a huge metro fan but this place is cheaper and has a lot of heart.  the food is so hot when it gets here i always burn my mouth.  all the other food i have tried is good but the pizza is the real star.  a rare gem in this city!!
179,5,Positive,it's a great neighbor place. the pizza is great. the salads are airways fresh and the chicken fingers are delicious! always friendly and fast service.
180,4,Positive,"good prices. 
good ny pizza. 
fast. 
good selection of slices with cool toppings. 
easy to stop in if you're walking on fremont. 

bottom line: don't drive across town for this one, but it's a good stop if you're on foot in the area."
181,4,Positive,"the thin crust pizza here is the best i've had in the valley. the thick or deep dish is just okay it doesn't really do it for me to say the least. but boy are the flavors there when you order the thin crust.  we always used to come here on tuesdays to get the tuesday take out special which apparently stopped. when we called today to go get the usual tuesday deal to us the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no. so now that they have taken away my tuesday special i can tell you at this moment that the chances of us going to nellos after this are slim to none.

i'm severely disappointed that they have no specials anymore but nothing lasts forever i guess. i will miss you nellos very much i will but i guess we will be sticking closer to home and trying out pizza on 87....sigh.... :("
182,4,Positive,"the 10"" margherta pizza smelled fresh and yummy and the 4pc chicken mix was also very tasty, but the chicken was a pinch salty but still juicy. the garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good. some of the garlic bread was bit tough but still has a good flavor. the wedges are nicely flavored and crispy. was a bit pricey but sort of worth it. overall i give it a 8 1/2 out of 10."
183,5,Positive,"the best pizza that i have found so far in las vegas!  the stromboli's are good, tha anti pasta is great, etc.  love this small walk up with a few tables for sitting.  the best part though (as it should be) is the pizza!"
184,5,Positive,"amazing savory pies!!!  the green chili gringo hand pie is ridiculous.  perfect flakey crust, just the right amount of filling of pork green chili, eggs, potatoes and cheddar- great on the go breakfast!  i also tried the 5"" pork green chili pot pie, which of course was wonderful.  we need one more pizza and/or desert shop across the street and we can officially call this stretch of coronado bordering 7th street: the pie district."
185,4,Positive,"excellent pizza -- the best delivery i've had. tasty and not too greasy. 

love the restaurant's emphasis on sustainability -- they use local ingredients and have a lot of environmentally sustainable business practices. 

fantastic pizza and socially conscious -- we just found our new go-to pizza place."
186,4,Positive,"it may be little....but this market has punch!

a cupcake truck (salted caramel cupcake, mmm), pizza oven truck, crepe truck....spices, fresh fruits and veggies, the world's most fragrant popcorn, cheese, plenty of meat options (bison bratwurst?!)....i have to say my expectations have been exceeded. 

add in the fact that a number of great restaurants/ bars/ coffee shops are within walking distance, and just found yourself a lovely tuesday afternoon."
187,4,Positive,"great location .  very nice inside as well as outside.
the pizzas and pasta were superb.
great service and nice atmosphere."
188,4,Positive,"just left and it was my second visit. i really love everything i've ordered so far! the butter pecan shake is to die for. you get pecans in every sip, it's amazing. i am not a soda drinker at all but i love the tractor soda and i wish there was somewhere i could purchase it! the only thing i didn't like today was how long everything took. it already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food. our food also came out all separate. we got our milkshake first, 10 minutes later my bf got his burger and 15
minutes later i got my pizza."
189,5,Positive,"lovely little place off the beaten path, yet walking distance from everything. cozy ambiance both inside and on the patio. the prosciutto and mushroom pizza was delicious-thin and crispy crust cooked perfectly, not burned. i would definitely eat here again on my next visit to toronto!"
190,5,Positive,"we planned a casual wedding rehearsal dinner at streets of new york, near the site of the wedding. we live 600 miles away, so i had to make all plans by phone/email. the restaurant and its manager were great! the tables were set up and we were ready to go as soon as the wedding party arrived. all i did was embellish the tables a bit with some sparkly confetti, and it looked festive and inviting. the presentation was great, and so was the food! we had  crisp, fresh green salads and wonderful breadsticks. we ate a delicious baked ziti pasta, along with a number of outstanding regular-crust pizzas. we loved the mediterranean pizza! we also had the new york, meat-eaters, vegetarian, hawaiian, and a special one with pesto, feta, and sliced tomatoes. each one was great! we ate our fill and had plenty left to save and munch on later. the service was superlative. i highly recommend streets of new york on east germann rd. as a great place to get together with friends to enjoy some terrific food!"
191,5,Positive,"this is based on a take out experience, so please do not expect to dine in there and have me stand by my review :)

we were looking for a new pizza place to try near our house on a lazy sunday.  given that some seem closed on sundays, we decided to look up fazio's as i had in my bookmarks.  although it said it was closed here on yelp (i did send a message with the hours for it to be corrected), we continued to look at the menu that it had a link to.  it said they were open so we called in our order. 

large cheese pizza and 1/2 chicken parm hoagie to go (we did not want to commit to a whole after a few bad experiences elsewhere).  we wish that we ended up getting a whole though, that is for sure.  the pizza was thinner, not too heavy crust wise, there was ample cheese (by ample, i mean a lot), and the sauce was great imo.  the chicken parm hoagie was crispy, not mushy, and absolutely awesome!  everything was awesome... and we will definitely be ordering from there again.  my husband said that they were extremely nice in there too.  

cannot wait to go back!"
192,4,Positive,girlfriend took me here for my birthday. awesome pizza. a little pricey but well worth it.
193,4,Positive,"love it. owners are from west babylon, ny. they had a pizza shop and italian bakery in islip terrace ny right down the street from where i grew up. i could not believe they lived here for so long and i was unaware. garlic knots are great and the pizza is good ny style. the family were all in tonight and visited our table when they heard we were from east islip. uncle joe is such a nice man. the entire evening was just delightful. i am happy to discover this little gem of a place and i will be back. happy to say they opened a beall's outlet right next door too so i can shop and eat. well, at least until they move to their new location."
194,5,Positive,the pizza taste just like pizza in  new york .  it has a thin crust  and they cook it in the brick oven. the sauce is so full of flavor.  it is hard to find good pizza anywhere outside of new york but this is the best i have had so far.. im craving it right know. i usually get the pepperoni or add hot peppers to it..
195,4,Positive,"duck poutine pizza. of course, that is what everyone is talking about. i'm still thinking about it the next day. it's one of those dishes that is perfect for the great white north. the kind of food you need to fatten up before the great hibernation. if bears could, they would order the duck poutine pizza before they slept for the winter. and after a lunch of this pizza i needed a nap. it's definitely worth a trip to bannock to eat this deliciousness especially if you need to bulk up for a long cold winter."
196,5,Positive,"do you know how difficult it is to make a 5-star hawaiian pizza? maybe you don't like hawaiian pizza, maybe you don't care.  but as a lover of hawaiian pizza i can tell you that is very easy to make a 3-star hawaiian pizza and exceedingly difficult to make a 5-star hawaiian pizza.  the one here is it.

the dough was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was delicious. i assume this applies to all of their pizza too. but the pineapples were the perfect size of chunks, plentiful, and did not soak through the dough.  the ham was not thin slices or cold cut ham; but rather thick chunks of cured pork.  add to that a dash of the chilli-olive oil that they bring to the table, and you've basically got the perfect hawaiian pizza.  my dad had a different pizza with chicken and it also looked awesome (he said he loved it though i did not try it).

for dessert i had the tiramisu, and i cannot complain - clearly homemade, terrific balance of sweet and coffee flavouring.

piola is near queen and dufferin, a bit far from the downtown core. i will be back; it is worth the trip!"
197,5,Positive,great pizza at a small price. tonys is one restraunt in boulder city that really has good value with a great product. real pizza here. the slices are awesome also..
198,5,Positive,"well what can i say about rocky's. its one of the few pizza places i like to eat from and im not a real pizza lover.

pizza is nice thin crunchy crust with an amazing sauce.
first time i ate there i ordered a pepporoni slice, and thats where it all started.
after that we ordered a full pizza, my wifey was in pizza heaven (major pizza lover) it was delicious, didnt complain one bit.
tried one of there baked subs and it was tasty too.(meatball sub)

wings were great too, nice and spicy and very good.

only thing is they dont have fountain drinks, they sell soda by the can, tea, gatorade, water and are not open that late.
all n all it was good."
199,5,Positive,"there aren't a lot of places in the montreal region you can get your hands on some great authentic napoletan pizza. this place is a regular for my wife and i.

i won't go into all the details but the pizzas are great. thin crust, focus on the quality of the ingredients. fresh and tasty.

quebecois beware. there aren't handfuls of toppings, the quebecois couple we invited with us once were shocked to have been deprived their usual bucket of toppings that dilutes the taste of a well done wood oven cooked pizza.

the arancini balls are very very good.

their nutella pizza is a favorite of ours too.

service is quick and friendly.

my highlights are when the owner passes by and says hello and i get to converse some of my rusty napoletan. :)"
200,4,Positive,"i got my order to go. my veggie pie was ready when i arrived. the price was very reasonable. the place was clean, had a fresh and trendy appearance, and outside seating if desired.

i came here because they have a vegan pizza that is made with hummus instead of fake cheese! i thought this was so awesome, but you can see from the picture that the hummus is just mainly piled on top in the middle instead of spread uniformly over the pizza as a base. so basically you eat the pizza with veggies on it, and then take a spoon to the center to get the hummus. all of the ingredients tasted good despite the awkward assembly. 

service was bland... not rude...but never smiled. 

regardless, i give this place a thumbs up because it offers real vegan pizza!"
201,5,Positive,"i would give this spot 10 stars if i could. this is as close as it gets to real italian pizza, which i have eaten plenty of in italy. that means, great crust, and no ""american"" tomato sauce, but rather a good fresh, ground, uncooked tomato sauce that gets cooked in the oven. the pepperoni is not like you get in the us. it is sausage resembling more of a home made pepperoni with strong pork flavor. the mozzarella cheese is made fresh and the parmesan is real, no fillers. salads are generous and very tasty with a simple dressing. the owner and staff are very on point to make sure you know what you are getting and do a fantastic job at making you comfortable. the only downside i experienced was that the glass of wine is small. i don't know what their pour is but it is the only thing not generously given. not served in a traditional stemmed glass, it was more like a small 1/2 full glass of fruit juice. but i went for the pizza, not the wine. also, short wait time. the pizza bakes in 90 seconds once it is in the oven. novanta means 90."
202,4,Positive,pizza is pretty good here. came in for a pizza at lunchtime place was pretty dead so didn't wait to long. the beer was ice cold. will come back for sure. if you haven't been here it's worth the trip.
203,5,Positive,"great pizza place. this is the type of restaurant that is typically found downtown pittsburgh. we had the pork wings which had a smokey sweet bbq sauce. they were amazing. the pizza was around 12 inches and was about medium/thin thickness. it is pricey and i highly recommend going during happy hour to save some money. which reminds me, the beer selection was eclectic and i enjoyed some beers that i wasn't familiar with. absolutely recommend coming here."
204,5,Positive,best pizza in the area by far. one of the best i've ever had. the seafood pizza is absolutely amazing. great service and they go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.  so for everyone who said they had an unpleasent experience next time open your mouth and say something or don't complain. unfortunately we know people who have avoided the restaurant because of some of the reviews people have written.  if you don't like the pizza then that's your opinion.  i understand but i eat there quite often and have never had a bad experience . i have never talked to anyone who has either.  for those of you who are wondering no i am not th owner but i am one of his best customers i bet. the only reason i am giving them 5 stars is because it wont let me give them 6. to the management of fat bobs keep up the great work and for god sakes don't change the sea food pizza.
205,5,Positive,"the pizza was really good!
they have interesting combinations but everything is really testing. i've been here 3 night in a row.
i recommend this"
206,5,Positive,"a place with only french fries and ice cream - what a divine idea!  it's easy to find gourmet ice cream parlors, but gourmet french fries are a new treat!  

i recently visited and was immediately struck by the ambience of the inside.  although the restaurant is enclosed, it has high ceilings and a pickup window which helped give it a vibe of being outside, particularly close to a fun beach location.  whether it's the thought of gourmet french fries and ice cream that helped fuel the ""vacation"" vibe, i definitely got a nice break from reality when i walked in.  

i ordered the pizza fries with pepperoni and man were they yummy!  crispy hand-cut fries seasoned with fresh herbs, perfectly melted cheese and topped with baby pepperonis, all with marinara sauce for dipping.  it was amazing!  i don't know why more pizza restaurants don't convert to serving pizza this way, it was a really inspired!  

this place warrants a visit, whether you order or just enjoy the ambience and drool over the menu while you're there.  no matter your tastes, sweet or savory, sweetie fry has something you will enjoy!"
207,4,Positive,my deliverer was fast and nice. this is my go to place when i was some garlic breaded pizza.
208,5,Positive,"loved this place! went for lunch. and had the bianca with sausage. the pizza came out really quickly and was hot. loved that they have not only grated parm and pepper flakes, but also hot oil. i also asked for a side of sauce (my pizza didn't have it on it) and they brought some with no problem. the space is bright and really welcoming, and the people are friendly. will definitely be back!"
209,4,Positive,"the idea behind this place is great. it screams nostalgia for any gamer while providing really good pizza. the pepperoni pizza was delicious. the crust was cooked to perfection and the cheese was gooey and melted. they carry a variety of canned sodas, my personal favorites including grape soda and vanilla dr. pepper! being able to play video games while you wait for your order is what makes this place so unique. each table against the wall has at least one system hooked up varying from nes to the wii u and ps3! overall great place. 4 stars instead of 5 because of location size. it could be so much more if moved to a larger location. but, start small and grow super pizza bros."
210,5,Positive,"excellent food! great staff! all around a great experience. it's hidden in a strip mall attached to a gas station. who on earth would think this would have been one of my favorite pizza joints in the country? the flavors were amazing. had the guido and zen garden. i loved them both. i'll defiantly be back. go try it, you'll love it."
211,4,Positive,"parents took me here while i was home for labor day. we walked right in on a saturday evening, no wait. place is nice and open inside, especially on a nice day with the patio open. 

we got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. i was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. i was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in sautéed onions, but wow were they good. seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in. tasted like a chicken wing should, not trying too hard to mask the actual taste. i wish i had taken a picture so you could see the onion pile, which we ate on the pita bread that came with it (my dad also added some to his pizza when it came.)

the pizza was also quite good. i loved the mushrooms because they were cooked differently than the normal soggy type that shows up on pizza. my only complaint, and i know it's coal oven pizza, is that the edge of our pizza crust was very burnt. the bottom wasn't, but the edge of about half was extremely blackened. i think it needed spun more in the oven while cooking to even it out. but i'd still definitely return, it was even good cold for breakfast leftovers the next day!"
212,5,Positive,"found out about dino's from a neighborhood post, went with my family for dinner, was not disappointed, food was delicious, had a caesar salad and a 16 inch pizza , the crust was amazinggggg, so crispy , not something i come across too often living in az.. the staff is super friendly, the only thing i will mention is that they are clearly still putting the finishing touches together on the look and presentation, and are not quite all set up, but they are only open for 3 weeks and they haven't had their official grand opening, but i will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone! i mean at the end of the day its the food and service that matters to me and they are a 10 in both!!!"
213,4,Positive,"stopped here for a quick bite before going to dinner. had a delicious slice of pizza with goat cheese, onions, eggplant and heirloom tomatoes. pleasant service also and the place was packed with patrons."
214,4,Positive,"tops is the oddball little neighbourhood dive bar/sports bar that i would be happy to call my local watering hole. 

cont'd below, but first off - as far as pizza goes, tops are total champions! super heavy yet not greasy, and loaded the hell up with tasty toppings, tops does pizza right. we got the new yorker half and halfed with the spartan pizza. steak bites, mushrooms, green pepper, onions and bacon stripes [sic] (actia;;u there were a tonne of spelling mistakes on this menu - @yycist would have a hayday) meets donair meat and banana peppers. it's unruly delicious. it's also close to $40 for an xl (14"").a worth it? yeah, we both had leftovers.

you start getting north and what happens? unfortunately the bars get further and further away. you'd better hope you live next to a fits-all bar that fits you. or, you know, you could just live a lifestyle that doesn't involve having a close to home spot where you can drink, eat, and befriend the other drinkin' eatin' locals... but i don't even want to entertain that as a possibility...

now i say sports bar/dive bar. on first look, tops is surprisingly nice, sporting a giant guitar in the roof. on the ground, the bar counters shadow the outline of the giant guitar. where the fretboard is, is a long bar height table good for conversational seating for up to 8 people. but for some reason i can't help but think that it is merely lipstick on a pig... maybe it was the human feces smeared along and adjacent strip mall glass door, and then piled on the sidewalk below, as i approached tops... maybe.

but tops can't be blamed for that, it wasn't even their business! well, yes it wasn't their business, but can they be blamed? ehn, i have a feeling that's a different story altogether... i don't yet know the denouement."
215,5,Positive,"sucks!!! totally sucks!!!! sucks that i can't change what i get regularly there. so good i get the same thing every time and some how taste better every time! will keep going back again and again.
every one needs to go here!
it's subway but with pizza. i'm getting hungry already and about to head over to custom built pizza...... yum!"
216,5,Positive,"my family and i tried this restaurant for a grad celebration, based on the great reviews on yelp and it sure delivered! our party of 4 ordered a few apps to share as well as 3 mains.
the highlights were the antipasto della casa, margherita pizza and agnolotti. i also need to mention how delicious the tiramisu was - and i'm a chocolate cake kinda girl!
service was also phenomenal - we can't wait to return!!"
217,4,Positive,"always searching for a lunch deal - that's me. luigi's may become my near west side place to go when i am out doing errands and crave some cheezy fresh pizza and a salad.
lunch special - any pizza at 6 inch size with any small salad for $8.99. that is a good deal when the pizza is truly handmade with fresh mozz.
i chose the housemade spicy sausage pizza and the arugula salad. crust was thin and perfect really. (fyi- i am super picky about pizza crust.) sausage was tasty.
 the salad was big for a small salad; it came with lots of caramelized onions, walnuts and fresh goat cheese.
while a 6 in. pizza would not satisfy my husband - for me it is exactly right for lunch.

service was very friendly and prompt even though the place was busy at noon with 80% tables full and one large kid party.

tables have paper covers and crayons- fun!

they were offering some fresh fruit sangrias - which sounded awesome - must go back and try those!"
218,4,Positive,"i am rating this for eat in only. the pizza was awesome!! the loaded fries not so much, it was a very small serving and just bland. we had plenty of drink refills and ate downstairs during a planned event. i gave it a 4 based on the fact that one menu item was great and the other not. i would like to try it again but skipping the fries."
219,5,Positive,"i was here with friends a few weeks back and i must say i was quite impressed by the pizza they serve. they have huge pizza on the display which is quite appetising. 

we ordered mushroom pizza and hot lips (i remember pineapple as one of the toppings). hot lips was quite an amusing name!! they give huge slices of pizza and one slice is like a small pizza you get at regular pizza joints. they are also generous with the toppings they give. one slice is totally worth the price!! i prefer adding extra chilli flakes to my pizza as it adds extra zing to the whole experience of eating a hot slice of pizza. for drinks, i recommend the red ribbon mintt ginger dirnk. anytime during the day in hot summer, it is my favorite drink. it also goes well with the pizza. 

i will go back again and if you are in southside with a bunch of friends or by yourself, you should consider visiting this place for a slice of the huge pizza they serve!!"
220,4,Positive,"my boyfriend and i were so excited for this restaurant to open because it's so close to his house! we have been here three different times and were happy each time. i suggest going on wednesdays for wing night! their wings are great! we also enjoyed the pizza, the crust is awesome. the meatballs and cuban sandwich were just okay...which is why i chose 4 stars rather than 5. they also have a great beer selection!"
221,5,Positive,"i came here after receiving a free pizza at a yelp event.  upper crust had some of the best food at the event so i couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  

my friend and i came here on a wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  i can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a shiraz and it was good.  we shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  it was all so delicious!  

i also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  again, it was very tasty!  

 everyone was very friendly and prompt.  i will be back to upper crust!"
222,5,Positive,"seriously, i feel like such a fool for not trying this place sooner. i disregarded it for some hipster spot having a moment, but i was wrong. a pizza place that has mastered crust, that reminds me so much of my favorite nyc spot in the west village. seriously, give this place a try."
223,4,Positive,"clean, nicely decorated pizza place. the margherita is simple and delicious. ingredients look fresh and the service is friendly. every time i go it's in the late afternoon so the place is pretty empty and the service is fast.  i would like to try the bruschetta... have only tried the pizza so far."
224,4,Positive,"i have to say, this may be my favorite wood fired pizza in central phoenix. 

i'll have to try spasso's pizza a few more times to confirm that my infatuation was not the result of a long week, my chemical composition on that particular day, or the peace of a cold beer, but if future experiences are anything like my first, i am a fan! 

the house made mozzarella appetizer is ok. the steak (that my boyfriend ate) was fine. the real star here is the pizza, which had a perfectly chewy crust and the meat combination completed a perfect blend of cheesy saltiness. 

the owner was a little overly chatty, but at the same time, how can i blame him when clearly this restaurant is his pet project. the service was great...i don't think our water glasses were ever empty. 

i have to admit, a small part of my enthusiasm is probably because this restaurant is in town & country mall, which is a terribly under appreciated piece of real estate...i'd love to see this good, family-owned restaurant survive."
0,1,Negative,"i ordered a pizza at 4:49. got an email that said my pizza would be delivered at 5:18 to5:28. 5:38 still no pizza. called the store. they said it was out for delivery. i said i knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. still no pizza. called the store back. again, i was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. when i was on the phone the pizza came. when it arrived it was cold."
1,2,Negative,"the pizza wasn't very warm when it arrived (they didn't use the warming bag at time of delivery) and the order was wrong, but the pizza tasted good."
2,2,Negative,"food was great! loved the pepperoni rolls and the zamboni fries! service was sub par. they hustled at first; however the server entirely forgot our pizza. when we inquired, she proceeded to blame it on the kitchen. she never apologized, nor did she offer a discount. she coerced us into paying our tab and did not offer to get us any additional food or beverage. furthermore, she did not pass on to another server that we intended to stay and eat and drink-even though we explicitly stated that. we stayed for 45 minutes waiting to order more food and have our drinks refilled. our plates were cleared and we were not offered additional food/drink. no one addressed us. l

overall: good food, bad service."
3,1,Negative,if i could i could give 0 stars i would. so we show up around 5:30pm on a monday. place is pretty empty. ordered drink which took about 30 mins to get. ice was already melted in my drink. ordered apps and meals. we did not get out food until 7:30. we waited a hour and a half for food @ a empty upscale pizza shop. btw my pizza was cold. and there is some manager guy walking around looking busy but what a joke. also i ordered a calzone which was not a calzone. crust chandler simply italian is a joke of a place and anyone that waste there money obviously does not care about the food they put in there mouth or any kind of service. what a rip off. just remember every time someone has a bad experience they tell 10 people. i was with 4 people. that's 50 people in day. i think the major issue is the customer base has no clue what good italian is. it sad that so many people accept this.
4,2,Negative,"the pizza was great, but the guys that make it , while we were there they were scratching their heads, taking  their hats off to run fingers through their hair. and one guy that was cutting up something was eating. they need to wash their hands after scratching. will not be back to this one"
5,2,Negative,"if giordano's is looking to compete with lou malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe. the crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza. lou malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries. c'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!

to someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite. 

overall giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either. they could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks.
 
if you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to grimaldi's."
6,1,Negative,"fix your store, it is so poorly run that i cannot even go there. there are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!

our neighborhood is not this gross but if i was from outside the area, i would think it's the slums. totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. no excuses.

it also has a foul odor to it...the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks...nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards"
7,2,Negative,"went for the 1st.time to cpk on the advice of a friend, there were 8 in our party. we were seated at a table that was made for 6, kinda cramped for space,we endured because they said the wait for a bigger table would be 20 min. although there were 2 areas  bigger than where we sat that were empty.  
         now when your waitress finally shows for drinks (about 5 min) and the first words out of her mouth are.  ""they must think i'm  wonder woman, i already have a table of 7 and a table of 12"". translated= hey guys, your service is gonna suck but that's not my fault. and it did!!!!
          my wife and i split the pepperoni, sasuage and mushroom pizza, obviously  'shrooms are the cheapest ingredient cause that's about all we could find. pizza was bland, 'shrooms  overpowering and service sacked. if that's what your looking for in a dining experience, then this is the restaurant and location for you. if not  stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
8,2,Negative,"horrible customer service. i have gotten food from here a few times expecting to have a better experience from the last, but i was wrong to hope for that. i once called and they answered ""hold on"" and just put the phone down. after waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. i called back again and they answered ""hold on"" again. i waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. i asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says ""well what do you want to know specials on?"" in a kind of sarcastic tone. we've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. this has happened multiple times. when going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. horrible customer service. the food here is way over priced. the pizza is mediocre. they may use ""fresh ingredients"" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. maybe i would have thought the food was better if i received better service. 

if you want wayyyy better ny pizza go to rockos pizza. way better prices, extremely friendly service, way better everything."
9,1,Negative,"this hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest.  the pepperoni is clustered around the center.  the sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it.  the crazy bread is tasty though."
10,2,Negative,"more like 2.5 stars. i'm giving two so the owners will have more incentive to make the necessary tweaks.

i really wanted to like strada 241. it's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food was lackluster. we split a salumi plate and each had a pizza (i had the 'nduja). the salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats. the pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven).

i would come back to try the pastas and also to see if the pizza improves. there's no lack of effort here and the food is honest."
11,1,Negative,"used to be a good place. has gone downhill the last few years. i already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but i was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . 

i ordered to go and when i got their at 8 pm on a saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, i had a feeling something wasn't right. 
spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. one the was spaghetti with meat sauce, i would compare it to a can of chef boyardee. the other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. 

threw them both in the trash

after this meal, i also threw my streets of new york takeout menu in the trash"
12,1,Negative,one of the worst pizzas i've ever had. the cooks are really cheap when it comes to cheese (the pizza was almost all tomato sauce) because the cheese was missing. absolutely no taste. i don't usually bad reviews unless earned and these ppl working here certainly earned a bad review. maybe the owner is a cheap person and is forcing cooks to be cheap with toppings.
13,1,Negative,"my review is based on my experience with the management, not the food. the food is just ok, nothing to write home about. secret pizza at cosmo is better.

the manager on duty failed to do his duties when i requested him to call security to come assist me when i was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. i felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager never called them. he in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. i spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call. 

shame on you manager on duty sunday 1:30am for lying about calling security."
14,2,Negative,"honestly? it tasted weird. i was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. the sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what i expected. now, mineo's...better pizza."
15,1,Negative,"california pizza kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. the menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. 

before i went vegetarian i used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. i love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. they were addicting. since i've become vegetarian i settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. for some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. not for cpk. 

recently, since beginning to use yelp, i have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that i am used to. however, i tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... ya i just invented a new word. a food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. my friends are this way. it never fails. any time one of them has a birthday i get an invitation to eat at cpk and every time i groan. even before i swore off cpk forever, i was getting extremely tired of it. the second to the last time i went was for my birthday with some friends. i ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. i used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. not good. i struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and i didn't want to waste their money. but it was gross, and i vowed never to order it again. the soup was good though. the last time i went was with my sister, husband and niece. this time i ordered the new caramelized peach salad. on the menu, most of the new items sound really good. its just the execution of them that fails cpk. the peach salad was gross. the peaches were canned and then warmed, and i also saw no caramelization whatsoever. the combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. i didn't even get through half of the salad before i said forget it. my husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. the portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. my sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. she barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! they skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. 

the pricing at cpk has also become outrageous. it was almost $13 for my salad. for a salad! does anyone else find that wrong? considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. for such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. the service also sucks. our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. no refilled waters, no how is everything. she was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. 

so we all have made a vow never to return to any cpk. especially the one in the chandler fashion center. before i went vegetarian, i got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. that was a great experience."
16,1,Negative,first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned
17,2,Negative,second time in and again i wait for a ready now plain ole cheese pizza!   i need to learn to go to another store that may be ready to care for customers!
18,1,Negative,"ordered delivery for me and the kids. two hours later, our meal arrived. i called to inquire after about an hour. was told that the delivery was on the way. minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. do you think it was on the house? nope. just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. not good enough. 
now, let's talk food. the meatball ""panini"" was a piece of french bread with a bland/acidic sauce. the meatballs were overcooked and dry. not a pleasant experience. the pizza sauce was also watery and bland. you'd think that a place called ""sauce"" would have figured it out by now. not so."
19,1,Negative,"if i could give this 0 stars i would.
delivery took an hour. pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping.  gross is the only word i can think of to describe this pizza. save your money. you'll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at giant eagle."
20,2,Negative,"my order got here earlier than expected but the toppings, cheese and sauce is all over the box. now the crust is soggy. i hate being that person but now i have to call for a new pizza."
21,1,Negative,"the service is slow and not very friendly and the pizza tastes store bought. i've tried to eat here several times with friends. 
but it just doesn't seem to do anything for me. 
there's a jack in the box across the parking lot with hot food and friendly service."
22,1,Negative,"this place sucks! the guy was very nice on the phone taking my order, but then 30 min later, i receive some call from gary saying that they do not deliver to me. thanks for letting me know when i placed my order and gave you my cc# already!!
i don't know how the pizza is yet, from other location, because it has yet to arrive. 
waste of time"
23,1,Negative,"horrible food don't waste your money

this is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza i've ever had, i haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. idk where that place is cuz the one i wan in today in east liberty by the home depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.

loudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. not one person there had decent customer service skills i had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and i have excellent hearing. i ordered a small pizza i got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. 

i looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today."
24,2,Negative,"ok for $5 - 6  but not good pizza, no  flavor,  good for young children or anyone else who likes bland pizza!  if they want to charge extra for thin crust they should put it in writing! i would rather give my $5.00 to little cesar's!"
25,2,Negative,"i used to like the pizza from here. last time i ordered it was still doughy and i had to cook longer. today it was ice cold. not even lukewarm. my kid was screaming for pizza so i didn't send it back. but, i won't ever order from here again. $31 plus tip for a cold pizza and cold soup. there was a piece of ""garlic bred"". it was half a sub roll uncooked with some garlic butter on it. yum. should have had a can of progresso and a frozen pizza and saved $25. wait, i could have saved $35. i tipped $10. i figure a poor kid driving his own car deserves a decent tip. i called to let them know and she said sorry we can replace the pizza. my kid ate the cold thing anyway. and who wants to wait another hour for the replacement? blah. next time i'll drive my lazy self over to bonnanos and pick up a pizza myself."
26,2,Negative,"i really enjoy the food, can't say the same about their service. i waited an hour and 20 minutes for two pizzas and when they finally arrived they were incredibly cold! not a happy customer."
27,1,Negative,absolutely avoid this place it's a last resort for me and even then i regret it. undercooked pizza sparse toppings and the rudest employee ever. they need to just shut this place down i've given them so many second chances and will never do it again. when you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! i hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot.
28,2,Negative,"waiter was over the top cheesy.  talked too much.  a bit obnoxious.
no gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (ferro's on st. clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free).
one of the specials had risotto as a side so i asked if i could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no.  treated me like i was asking them to make risotto from scratch.
so i ordered a steak instead which was good but if i wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place.
marcello's is clearly stuck in the past....no variety for those with dietary restrictions."
29,1,Negative,"my wife and i visited east west pizza because we purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate for $2 and we've been questing to find decent pizza in the area.

our meal here was mediocre. we were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while i stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza.

i wasn't going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago i received a spam email from east west -- i must have filled out some comment card or something so, i emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list. they replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. 

for the next several months, despite this guarantee, i continued to receive spam in my email from east west. i emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. tonight i emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming.

east west pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that i never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers."
30,1,Negative,"my fiance ordered from here recently. after waiting almost 2 hours for our pizza to arrive, we called and asked what was going on, they said it would be there soon. ten to fifteen minutes later it shows up and the driver informed us that they forgot to make the pizza. any to top it all off we received some cardboard with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices on it. wouldn't recommend"
31,2,Negative,"i'm just in the area for the day... showing some houses to some buyer clients and needed a place to stop for lunch between appointments. i ate too much. this brother's is not as good as a similar place on peoria... but it was decent. i would eat here again if driving by and in the mood for pizza. my pepsi tasted fine. the girl who took my order was happy & pleasant. i got my soda topped off before i left and i got two sides of ranch at no charge... the only thing i was out off by was that i'm glad i didn't have to pay for the ranch because they were both half full which is why i needed two. if i had paid for them, i would have said something. i'm full, happy and ready for a nap... oh! need to show houses... 

i ordered the two slices of cheese and a pepsi and my total was $4.38

um i went to the bathroom before leaving,.. the door didn't lock and toilet sprayed water (yes toilet water) at me and did not flush properly... hopefully they get that fixed!"
32,2,Negative,"2 stars

the pizza is ridiculously overpriced, $17 for an 11-inch pizza?

our server was a little aggressive, he even complained about his other customers to us.  who knew what he was saying about us?   he also must have thought we were stupid because he kept explaining the difference between sausage  and pepperoni?  really?

the server really ruined this meal for us, he even tried some adult humor with the serving of the beer.  i'll leave it at that.  so the food never had a chance, we just wanted to leave.

if you eat here...take your time, the pizza comes out real fast.

being from new jersey, we know and appreciate good pizza...this was mediocre at best.

we won't be returning."
33,1,Negative,i called in for delivery and waited an hour for them to deliver my pizza which yes they might have been busy i understand but when they drop it off i didn't take a look at the pizza because i was working and put it in the back in the break room as soon as i went to go get a slice the entire pizza was burned and it looked old. i waited an hour at least you guys should have made sure my pizza was not burn and at least somewhat fresh. it's so mess up. they wouldn't even give my money back.
34,1,Negative,i do not recommend going to this location what so ever. please drive a little out of your way and avoid this location. absolutely nothing hot n ready. while waiting 20 minutes for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest one would think the pizzas would be hot but they were room temp with no pizza sauce and hardly any cheese. please do not waste your money and time here. i grew up with little caesars and have been to many in different states over the past 15 years and i have never had such a bad experience food wise i have never left a little caesars pizza and thought i was ripped off but this location had me felling like i was ripped off which i was and you will be too. please go to any other location do not waste your time or money at this location.
35,2,Negative,"this place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  pizza nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one i've ever frequented.  the pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  you dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.  the lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.  it's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.  we didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.  if there was a better option in the area i wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't."
36,1,Negative,really bad experience here. went in at 6pm for a drink and asked about dueling pianos. they start @ 8pm. ok. we had two drinks and were hungry. asked if we could get pizza from across the way and bring in. yes that was fine. get your hand stamped so u can come back in. we got pizza (worst ever) and were then told we could not bring it in. had to sit outside and they were closing the bar for half an hour while they set up. ate and then got in line to go back in. no charge since we had our hand stamped. tried to fit at a table and were told no we had to stand. the tables were reserved!  nowhere did it state that we needed a reservation nor did the bartender tell us that. total bullshit way to treat customers who spent $50 on two drinks each!  extremely disappointed. sucks
37,1,Negative,"ordered from caliente on a weeknight, and it took an hour and a half to get the pizza.  when we finally got the pizza it was cold.  i was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed.  the toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  

bottom line - if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in two hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else."
38,1,Negative,"this is one of the worst experiences i've had at a restaurants. we ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. after over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. he said he was too busy to help us. he said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. if we didn't want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. who treats customers like that? i told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. she just shrugged her shoulders and said ""do what you have to"". i don't think i gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. the management is an embarrassment and service, all around was horrendous. what a disappointment."
39,2,Negative,this place had us pretty impatient the whole time! i shared a pizza with my significant other and he asked for half of it to have no onions but it came out covered in onions all over! it then took a half an hour to split the bill. to be honest i wasn't very impressed by the food.
40,2,Negative,"called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  once i placed my order i was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50....it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?  why a twenty minute range for pickup?  i cancelled order so never got to taste the food.  good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon.

fyi - your rating on yelp is the same as peter piper pizza.  hilarious!"
41,2,Negative,"i don't know what people are talking about. being from nj i can tell you this is not good ny style pizza. it's the kind of pizza you get in ny and then never return to that place again. i tried the regular and the white pizza. the white pie had no flavor, no garlic no salt, nothing. the regular pie had hardly any sauce, and the crust was hard as a rock. i hope there are better places for ""ny style"" pizza in the area.  we left hungry. they also messed up our order so it took about twenty minutes to get four slices of pizza warmed up.

also they weren't wearing gloves or anything. maybe i'm a stickler but i don't like people touching my food with their hands and then touching everything else in the kitchen. gross."
42,1,Negative,haven't been to pizza hut in a few yrs. my daughter and i wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so i ordered online  (ok that wasn't successful so i had to call) anyway i placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust. this was at noon. wasn't very happy. needless to say i don't think i'll be attempting this again any time soon
43,1,Negative,"i wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues...

we were very excited to move into sun prairie where there was a glass nickel pizza nearby (we previously lived in the milwaukee area).  the day after we moved in, we decided to order glass nickel to eat while unpacking.  the staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  pizza itself was okay, but not nearly as good as the new berlin and west madison locations.

the next day, we became violently ill.  with the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing i ate all day so i'm sure that it was from this.  my husband and i are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  we do not plan on re-visiting the sun prairie glass nickel pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  such a shame!!"
44,1,Negative,"still yucky.  picked up an order which should have been hot, hard as a rock like cardboard and burnt on the bottom.  there are many other places in town for good pizza avoid this and you will be more than happy.  hit and miss place, mostly miss"
45,1,Negative,pizza came out cold. we ordered the classic pepperoni and there were probably three slices of pepperoni in the entire pizza. it was just all sauce and cheese.
46,1,Negative,"did the online order. arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after i'm told it will be a little longer, i'm told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  wtf?!?  so now i'm sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  i wouldn't have ordered if i knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings. nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you've already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question i have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when i get home. i want a nice fresh, hot pizza. not something that's been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!!"
47,1,Negative,"the best thing about our visit was our waitress. she was attentive and apologetic that the pizza was terrible. it was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. too bad. it was the first time we have been out in the evening in 4 months.what a disappointment!  we won't be returning."
48,1,Negative,"we ""used"" to order the family special every week or two on a regular basis. food was decent & value for the $ (at that time) was fairly good too. one night we ordered, the food was delivered. we paid cash & tipped well (always do, as i used to deliver fast food myself). we get a telephone call the next day saying that we shorted the driver $10. wtf? seriously? like the driver would not know this right at the door (if it were true)? we do not get a call that night (we ordered for dinnertime) but the next day! clearly they got ripped off by their driver. we have not ever ordered from there again. brampton's best pizza(s)..mackay & gusto's."
49,1,Negative,"i was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  i should have saved my money. person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.

bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. we could tell when we opened the box.  the crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  on one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. the other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  

whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  i would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  that hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.

it such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  do i call and complain? do i have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 pm? 

we also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  good meat and tangy sauce.

finally, i was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  i ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.

i really wanted to like this place, especially because i like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. we won't be going back."
50,1,Negative,"terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn't get the deep dish, i didn't realize that is what they were famous for. also the staff were nice, not overly helpful but never rude. my daughter got their wings, super fatty (probably tyson). there was a long blonde hair in it, she has dark brown hair. when we told our waiter he said ok then took the plate, no apology. they did bring her out new ones but like i said before they were to fatty to enjoy. they did not even offer to take them off our bill. our thin crust pizza taste like it literally came from a box. i can't even remember the last time i have had thin pizza this bad!! the ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and i believe it was covered in the store bought hershey's syrup. i have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. nothing has ever been that disappointing that i felt the need to write one until now."
51,1,Negative,"these people are below average intelligence 
try to rip you off 
argue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store!
had enough of them i do not have the time to teach basic common sense !
the special reads add any pizza for 9.95
(equal or lesser value )
i order a pepperoni and sausage and a specialty pizza.
simple right well they say they can't honor the ""2nd"" pizza because it's a ""specialty""
what does it matter what order i say my pizza's in?
is it the darn important that you have to say the specialty pizza 1st? common sense would be to just charge for the specialty pizza the charge me for the pepperoni and sausage at 9.95 right?
well if i have to teach them basic common sense and argue over it i will just find me a new shop!"
52,1,Negative,"very mediocre pizza. if you're stranded in the brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you're really hungry, you'd be better off walking to the circle k and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives. to everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little...and eat better pizza."
53,2,Negative,"normally we love papa john's, but they don't deliver to our place.  we really wanted pizza so ordered carryout from what we thought was the middleton store.  our mistake we ordered from here.  that's ok.  it was our mistake.

however, this store is insanely hard to find and get to and there is zero parking outside for carryout.  we ordered online from another store and the order stated it would be ready in 45 minutes.  it gave us a time.  it actually took longer than 45 minutes to weave through the square and finally park illegally in an alley behind the store while the husband went to get said pizzas.  they were just putting them in the oven.  so we had to wait another twenty minutes and staff wasn't apologetic, just rude stating that the pick up time is an estimate.

the pizza was fine.  it was fresh and stayed warm on an eighty degree day until we were home to eat it.  but....it's not worth the trip and while i gave no real issues with it taking an hour plus to be ready for carryout during a busy time of day  that should be acknowledged ahead of time."
54,1,Negative,the most disgusting pizza i have ever eaten.  nothing but salt and no cheese.  ugh...will never order from them again!
55,2,Negative,"pretty average spot. 

italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you. i had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. they've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. 

service was adequate. 

is baldwin street actually good?"
56,1,Negative,"we ordered this monday night after a busy work day. generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. not this time. i got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. i phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. i explained how i didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. they proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. i honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. i am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. violently awful and lasted for days now. please beware..."
57,1,Negative,"i was so excited for my sons 2nd bday party. it was aweful!! the host was everything but a host. a guest passed out cake and my husband stood at the door to hand out goodie bags. my party was from 4-6 and at 5:30 she started cleaning around people making it very awkward and guests left early. she was wearing a lower cut dress and i now have her cleavage in the pictures of my son blowing out his candles. 
when i booked the party i was told that each child gets 2 pieces of pizza, they actually get 1 slice cut in half. i had 15 children and 2 babies, i was charged extra for the babies even though they never left their mothers arms. she wasnt a kid friendly person and would just hollar out that it was time for cake or pizza, getting nobodys attention i was forced to round up the kids and get them seated. she started a ""soda tab"" and they charge $1 for a can of soda. at the end of the party i had spent $100 more than planned on sodas, extra pizza and the ridiculous 18% gratuity that was added on to my bill. a $45 tip was not what i had in mind for her. when calling the owner to discuss my issue she did nothing to resolve it and might have well just called me a liar because she defended the host to the very end. i will not recommend toy town to anyone!! bad business!!!!"
58,1,Negative,"ordered 5 pizzas at 11 for 11:45 pickup confirmed waiting for 25 minutes and pizza still not ready. 
got an ""oh sorry"".  

i watched 5 customers leave.  one said, "" let's go for office max we stand a better chance of getting food."""
59,2,Negative,we went for dinner and it was alright. the bruschetta was the best part of the meal! the pizza was soggy and the quinoa salad was alright.
60,1,Negative,"every once in a while i love to remind myself as to why i don't order delivery from chain pizza places like domino's, pizza hut, papa john's, etc. sometimes i'm pleasantly surprised and tonight i was not. 

over an hour and a half delivery time and i received a soggy medium pan pizza. but what had me most concerned is that my pizza was pulled out of the oven and checked at 6:35ish and was sitting there for over 45 min before it left the store. 

after delivery fees and tips for $16 i recommend eating a frozen pizza because at least you can pull it out when it's actually done baking. me, didn't have access to an oven. otherwise i know what i would've done. baked a pizza."
61,2,Negative,"do yourself a favor: order carry out, not delivery. i order here like twice a month, but about 1/3 of the time i order delivery they attempt to deliver my pizza to the wrong apartment. 

not sure why their drivers can't plug my address into google maps and figure out where i am. the staff at this location have proven to be incredibly incompetent and i am sick of giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances."
62,2,Negative,"wow i have been here four or five times. the first couple were a few months ago and i thought the pizza and pasta was great! i'm from chicago and appreciated having this nearby. well i'm not sure what happened but the past three times in the last two months are unacceptable. just bad. first visit -- watery spaghetti and meatballs. it was marginally ok ... i ate it. the garlic bread was ... terrible, i could have made better with wonder bread and garlic salt which is basically what it was ... second time, i waited in line and their computer system went down it was a friday night and they had no clue what to do... i forgave them for this, it happens but they could have written down my order and made my pizza ... they were completing orders and had other customers they just decided to freak out and not take mine, how did people order pizza and pay before computers? i had cash too. third time tonight is just unacceptable. i don't eat a lot of pizza or carbs, when k to it's a treat ... i just spent $35 for a take and bake pizza (it was not cooked) and eggplant parmesan (which was surprisingly ok) but the garlic bread was also not cooked. when i say this stuff was not cooked i mean it was not cooked. i had to break out my toaster oven which i did not appreciate. terrible. i guess i have to find a new place or stick with due forni even though they are not really a take out place, huge disappointment i was hungry... 3 strikes you are out."
63,1,Negative,"the pizza was burn over cooked. we eat three slices and make up no taste to it. would not recommend this place for their pizza. at the end we asked for a box, the staff make us a small container for more than a half of a pizza. not even a pizza box ."
64,1,Negative,"we found this place several years ago and had some family with us. we ordered pizza, salad and garlic knots. everything was so delicious. we visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. last night proved it will be the last time. a 16' pizza is now $20 or more. all the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. they only have one size pizza. we ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. we asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. we have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time.  ordered 6 wings $6.50 for 6 wings
 they were very good. we asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. we got charged .60c for a souffle cup. nope that was it. so very dissatisfied overall. service was mediocre. guess all customers will have to pay for the minimum wage hike, tipping no longer needed."
65,1,Negative,"when i got home to eat my pizza it barely had any cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni. next time i'll pay the extra fee for more toppings, if i ever from here again."
66,1,Negative,"the last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food. we decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour. three hours later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, ""we got busy, we can't help it"". i can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! and we're less than 5 miles down durango from them. the food is decent, but we won't be ordering from them again. don't waste your time."
67,1,Negative,the staff was super nice and delivery was quick. however for three large pizzas it was over $72. the pizzas were plain with no flavor. looked beautiful but zero spice
68,2,Negative,"after hearing so many people in the area raving about folco's i finally decided to try it out. and we were looking for a reception spot for a baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  i was disappointed about the food. the veal parmigiana was sub-par. too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. my husband tried a pasta dish which was ""ok"" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. the drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste i was hoping to get out of it. the caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. their tomato sauce - homemade i was told - tastes like something out of a jar. i was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the italian restaurant across the street. i was hoping to go back & try out their pizzas, but there is a much better italian restaurant in the garden basket plaza that makes everything from scratch and i have been a regular of theirs since they opened."
69,1,Negative,"if i had to rate this place on pizza alone, this review would be a lot different.

first of all, i have had a $5 off an order of $20 or more coupon for.. well, i can't even tell you how long. every time i call to place an order, they give me some new bs excuse as to why i can't use my coupon. (""oh, we already ran your card"" which, well, why the fuccccccc would you do that? and i'm sure if i wanted to add something to my order, that would be justtttt fine. or ""well, the you can't use that with the family deal,"" in which case, why the heck isn't that written on the coupon? that's really something that should be in the fine print.)

then tonight, my family in from out of state decides on pizza and wings... and regardless of the stupidity of their employees (""well, the family deal does come with two two liters,"" ""uh, no it doesn't... it comes with one..."" ""welll i am looking at it right here and it says two liters."" really? yes. one bottle is two liters. derrrrrrp.) their pizza happens to be some of my fave. so we order pizza and wings, and we ask for medium wings with extra wing hot sauce on the side. instead, we get a vat of ranch and wings that are dryer than betty white's.... well, yanno."
70,2,Negative,"the pizza is good, a little limited in variety, but that is the traditional thing, i guess. does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out."
71,1,Negative,"poor service. terrible food. soggy and undercooked, no understanding of the problem. 
took 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza. had our money refunded the food was so terrible."
72,1,Negative,"visited this place on november 19th 2016, which is national adoption day, and the service was horrible. the cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly. we had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate. as we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn't have to move just yet. at that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven't even received our food at the time. the food came out sporadically as we'd get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last. this place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business."
73,1,Negative,absolute garbage. 0 stars. flies crawling all over the slices. smells gross. pizza barely had any tomato sauce. pepperonis were like the ones from a lunchable. cheese is plastic crap. i'm royally pissed off & papa ceo would be too!!!!!! gross!
74,1,Negative,"we ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  horrible customer service.  if the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  better yet, never order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!"
75,1,Negative,ok so they charge a lot just for a single slice of pizza but what gets me is they charge a lot for what looks like old pizza that they reheat just to give to you which is one messed up and two gross i recommend going to paris casino and go to la pizza same price but man is it worth it the pizza at that place was amazing definitely worth the walk and and use your money for better food!
76,1,Negative,"what went wrong is the service. we called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away. an hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person. so it's either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves. we were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted. this is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later...."
77,1,Negative,great childhood memories but absolutely horrible pizza & customer service tuesday night! if i could leave no stars i would. both our pies had no cheese or at least not enough to be considered pizza. when we called to complain the young man did not want to hear it & firmly stated all ingredients are weighed out period. left my name & # for the manager/owner to call me (because he was too busy) and still have received nothing. i will never go back
78,2,Negative,"i just don't get it.  why is this a local favorite?  the pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  i also ordered the chicken parmesan with linguine.  the chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.  they don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.  i'd eat at carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.  the search for good pizza in phoenix continues."
79,1,Negative,"reading previous posts, obviously people who like this place have never been to any decent pub whatsoever.... with that being said this place is never busy, especially during the day, and for decor wise it looks like a hospital with the wall paper ... food is mediocre but always frozen ya i can tell.... with that being said its no wonder why there is never anyone in there personally is rather have shitty service at madison's or boston pizza or actually the black bull pub but atleast the food is fresh and 9c wings at the black bull"
80,1,Negative,the service was super slow. they had maybe 5 people inside and another 15 outside and we had to wait close to an hour for our pizza we never got. wouldn't suggest if you're hungry.
81,1,Negative,i love pizza 73s pizza. but this place uses the same spatula to spread the sauces on the pizza. many times when ordering a creamy garlic based sauce because i have a tomato allergy. i have found tomato sauce mixed in with the creamy garlic. not impressed
82,2,Negative,"this was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. 

we came in around 1:30 on a sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. my wife and i decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. as we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. she then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? so we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish.

over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving. after a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! i was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. we ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. we both did not want any more! when our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. we may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!"
83,1,Negative,this was the worst pizza i have ever had. the cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. the crust was bland and hard. the price was right at $3.99 so i gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat.
84,1,Negative,ordered the pizza on my phone. it said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. went to pick it up. worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet. didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! i'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system? i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. i've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.
85,1,Negative,"after waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents i now know i should have kept waiting.   i expected a bit of a line but i was rushed through checking and they were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.   

we ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes.  and ordered a child's pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes. he got a thin crust. 

our deep dishes didn't come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the kids menu pizza and the thin crust. we were there over 3 hours.  oh and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it.  instead covered in olives which he hates.   

i regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much i love this place. the servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door.  save yourself the trouble of relying on their service. just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from chicago as this place doesn't deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set. 

""we swear 10 more minutes max and it's out"" waited another 20. 

this place doesn't deserve to wear the name."
86,1,Negative,i waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than i do... i ain't that mad but i just don't like getting diabetes. the customer service was good nothing bad to say .. but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds.
87,1,Negative,"we were honestly disappointed. when you go to a pizza place you expect at a minimum soda?? you can't drink beer there bc they have no liquor license so if you want a beer, you have to go next door and then they bring you your pizza.. and if you want something besides tap water with no ice, you get a choice of 3 seltzer waters..: with no ice. seriously so weird. i ended up going next door to the coffee shop just to get a coke. the pizza was okay, the service was terrible.. nobody came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, give us menus etc. for just opening up... we were disappointed."
88,2,Negative,one of the worst pizza i had . they did not even bother to make the pizza correct for me. overpriced . i would prefer blaze anyday.
89,1,Negative,wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought ...wth sbarro?  now mediocre isn't even bad enough u have to go sub par with it... smh
90,1,Negative,wife and i both got sick over their pizza.  it didn't taste right.  i did like the peppers they use.  but that's the only nice thing i have to say.
91,1,Negative,the pizza was not that remarkable.it came barely warm. one person in our party ordered a chicken wrap and as the rest of us finished our pizza the wrap still had not been served. we eventually cancelled it . the staff was apologetic .
92,2,Negative,"new italian restaurant. they make their own sauce and pasta ""everyday"" according to the waitress who served us. food was okay. garlic bread sold as ""charity bread"" was very tasty....apparently net proceeds are donated to some charity. 

because it is new....staff are inexperienced. they brought out a water bottle which they couldn't open...served us a pizza called ""americano"" instead of coffee americano (not sure why they thought we'd order 4 main dish for 3 people)...and when the coffee came, they forgot about cream which we had to ask for...by the time we got the cream...coffee was cold. still charged us full price, whopping 4 bucks for a very small amount of coffee...4oz maybe less. 

we were entertained for a while by the mishaps, but found the overall experience underwhelming. decent ambiance, louder music than i'd like, service can be significantly improved."
93,1,Negative,"my daughter ordered a large pizza and 8 wings online. the delivery came and it turned out to be a small pizza and 16 wings. when i called the store and asked them to review the order #, they read the order we received. i explained that's not what my daughter ordered, to which they replied, she must've hit the wrong buttons and proceeded to hang up. if i wanted to order another pizza, don't you think that would be a perfect opportunity to rectify the problem???  nope!!!  when my wife called back, casey the manager was extremely rude and offered nothing but a customer service phone number. we will never order from papa john's again... no matter where the location."
94,1,Negative,ordered a pizza a few weeks ago & have to say it was horrible. it seemed almost raw. the crust was cooked but the cheese was white not the golden color on a good pizza. it's a shame because it's so close to home. we've had food from there before but it's been awhile & it use to be good. i guess i'll be sticking with rocco's because they are always consistently good.
95,1,Negative,"um caliente seriously!?!

so after work i decided to order a pizza a pie. nothing too crazy. a red pizza by my definition is a pizza with red sauce on it. apparently, not this time. anywho i ordered a red pizza with parmesan on the side and garlic sauce.

i received: cheese with extra red sauce. no parmesan, and some weird sauce with green stuff in it maybe it cilantro/basil i don't know. plus it was undercooked! thats kind of a trifecta of badness by my definition. i dont know. i would like to say this was the first time i've received an undercooked pizza which i had to send back but alas it is my third.

caliente, whats going on?!?! i'm confused, bewildered, baffled even. step your game up or else giovanni's is more than welcome to take my money anyday."
96,1,Negative,"customer service here is terrible. i ordered a pizza on my way home from a 40 min drive, realizing i forgot my purse at work when i went to pick it up. no offer to look up my card number or anything so who knows what happened with the food - hopefully it did not go to waste. after about an hour and a half when i was on my way home again at 9:40, 20 min away, i called again to order, the person on the phone kept hitting buttons and telling me the disruption was on my end and in between the loud beeps, asked me if i could be there by 10 because they close their doors at 10. needless to say, i said forget it and placed my second order at one of the many nearby stores that keep their doors open way past 10 pm on a friday night. and when i drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the employees were standing around talking in the parking lot. must have had important things to do. won't be ordering from them again."
97,2,Negative,"over priced and under delivers!
- a 12 inch pizza was likely only 10 inch.
- it barely fed the two of us.
- tasted okay (definitely nothing to brag about)
- at $25, this was definitely not worth the price!
- won't be ordering from there again."
98,1,Negative,"ordered a hawaiian pizza, got half hawaiian,half cheese, and half burnt.
they vaguely describe that their ""sandwiches"" are calzones. they're kind of good."
99,1,Negative,the wings are not like they used to be seems like frozen cheap wings from walmart and the prices went way up thx to new law of 10hr i've been ordering from here now for 5 years but i want be no more not worth the extra money the pizza was ok but not great like in the past
100,2,Negative,"giordano's is a well known chicago restaurant that's famous for their chicago style stuffed deep dish pizza. they also offer hand stretched thin crust pizza and crispy extra thin pizza. on the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more.

on yelp i read about the long wait times so i planned to try them when they opened. at that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. we were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare. 

we shared an entree sized harvest salad. the salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. this salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it.

during our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. i found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality.

just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering.

i received my individual stuffed plain pizza. the pizza wasn't sliced all the way through and i found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. kinda like a rock. the crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. the very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. although i found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that i found inedible. i don't know if the crust i received is typical of giordano's or not. 

my husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. he said that he was glad that he wasn't hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. he did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the ""other"" chicago place uses.

i really liked the atmosphere and i really enjoyed the well trained servers i encountered.

i would never go back for the pizza i received."
101,2,Negative,"i'm sad to write this review, because i'm actually obsessed with caliente's hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad i feel that i can no longer give them my business! every time i order i get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time i call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes.... and every time it is late. last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair. but, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? if that was the only time this sort of thing happened, i would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time i went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well. maybe it's a training problem... a hiring problem?

pros:
+pizza is good

cons:
-slow inattentive service
-slow delivery
-general lack of concern about the happiness of their patrons"
102,1,Negative,i just moved to the area and i have ordered from this location twice... both times our hand tossed pizza showed up as a thin crust! i have ordered this same pizza at our other location several times and the thickness was perfect! our pizza was so thin that it could not even stay together on the ride over. guess i'll try the local papa johns.
103,1,Negative,terrible! this was unfortunately the we worst pizza i have had in a long time! i am staying at the wonderful andaz resort across the street. i thought i would get a quick pizza and bring it back to the room. i am so disappointed. we are ordering from one of the large chains so we can fix our pizza craving now.  sad...small...thin...pitiful pizza. you will notice that i never leave bad reviews but this time i have to. yuck!!!!! i wasted $18 plus a $2 tip!
104,2,Negative,"just ordered and holy smokes i've never seen the delivery time like this one, 65 to 75 minutes. wow they need to step their game because this is becoming not worth the wait at all not to mention it's a hit or miss if the pizzas cooked good or not disappointed"
105,1,Negative,"this will be my last time here. pizza is full of a ton of grease. the guys who make the pizza use their bare hands, then toggle back and forth to the cash register. last night my pizza was just a puddle of grease, its not even edible. their prices are outrageously expensive for the quality. its the closest to my house but i think the pizza at the 7-11 is better quality now. this place has really gone down the tubes. its just not what it used to be. a friend told me the one on s. buffalo is the real roccos to go. something about a bad break up between then two guys. i also spent 18 bux on a veal parm sub. seems a little pricey for the sub. it was good but not 18 dollar worth good. their pizza is just a greasefest. it must just be really low end cheese to create that. my recommendation would be to go to bambinos or east side for quality pizza. if you want really low end stuff that is over priced, come here and get some pizza that just sits out all day."
106,2,Negative,"it surprises me what celebrity chefs are willing to put their name on. riva is a poolside (all outdoor) restaurant at the venetian. we went here for lunch and i was completely underwhelmed by the choices on the menu and by the food itself. really? this is what a celebrity chef comes up with? sad.

very few choices so you better want a pizza, a club sandwich, or a standard salad. that's it. my daughter had the cheese pizza. i had the club sandwich, which came with fries. and i got a strawberry colada swirl. $60 later, we called that a lunch and left. i could have gotten that anywhere. why on earth would that be what wolfgang puck offered up? seems crazy to me.

if you want to overspend on something you can get better at your local diner...come here."
107,2,Negative,"i wanna like this place more. fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza. but the delivery times are sooo bad. worst i've ever experienced anywhere. they are always and forever late. and for the life of me, i can't understand why they can't keep up. every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour. i've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! how is the bad delivery the only thing consistent?? fix it!"
108,2,Negative,"i had such an awful experience. i've never been here before or had their food. i ordered through the phone for pick up. i was rushed to get my order in and the lady tried to hang up on me before i could even ask for the total amount (since i don't know the total with tax). 

i went by to pick the order, was greeted fine. i tell this balding older man i'm here for a pick up. he asks, ""the two pizzas?"" i said yes with a salad. he then cuts me off mid sentence to say, ""yeah yeah whatever."" he goes to the back to get the salad so i look through the menu one more time and he comes back to tell me, ""move where i can see you."" 

i will never come here again. this serve was down right awful and what made it worse, i was with my 6yr old brother and he had to sit through and listen to this. the pizza is not even that good!"
109,2,Negative,"quick review:  food:  delicious.  service:  poor.  slow.  

five of us tried lucille today for lunch.  we were seated quickly and served our drinks relatively quickly.  but, we waited well over an hour and a half for our food.  lunch should not take nearly two hours.  patrons will not go here for lunch if they think it will take more than an hour.  

our wait staff seemed inexperienced.  please train the staff before you open.

our party had both the detroit panned pizza and the neapolitan wood-fired pizza, the lunch pizza.  we all enjoyed the salad that comes with the lunch.   not quite to the standards of pizza brutta, but very good.   pizza and a very good salad for $10 is a great value.  

i know the place is new and i will try again.   but, service needs major improvement.  i really want to like this place."
110,2,Negative,"we had a menu shoved under our door. so we only thought to look at it. wished we had looked at yelp first. 
1) ordered the special: 2x 1 topping pizzas. we ordered pepperoni and pepperoni. we received one sausage and one pepperoni. 
2) we ordered cheese bread: it was ok. nothing amazing, a more flat pizza crust than pudgier bread sticks. 
3). we ordered fried mushrooms. these were pretty good. we received 11 in the order. 
4) we were not eligible for the free soda because we had ordered a special (which sucks. 
5) we ordered a 2 l of diet coke and a 6 pack. saying ""diet coke"" each time. 
i even told the story about how this is a pepsi town and we needed our diet coke. 
what arrived?  off brand diet cola. 
...
we picked this place bc of the diet coke written on the menu and the implicit guarantee of the guy taking the order. 

side note:  the menu says ""under new management"". 

i feel i can say this sucks under new management. 

review of the pizza:  it was 2 pizzas for 21$. it tasted like a 10$ pizza. so i'm ok w it. 

...just to prove i'm not crazy i'm going to post a pick of the words diet coke...

so:  1 star for getting it here in 30 min (guy said 30-45 min, and it was a dinnertime delivery on the strip) and 1 star bc the food taste met the price."
111,1,Negative,"ordered for delivery and was told to expect a 40 minute wait, after an hour and a half our cold pizza's arrived. 
 the meat lovers pizza contained tasteless greasy italian sausage, soggy pepperoni, and cold crusty ham slices in extremely sparing amounts.
 the grilled steak chipotle pizza came completely without sauce. nothing better than a cold dry pizza.
 would not recommend to my worst enemies."
112,1,Negative,worst customer service ever ! driver first got our order wrong three times and had to keep returning to switch out our pizza then our mozzarella sticks then we got the wrong 2 liter. driver then offers a meal on her for all the inconvenience and doesn't fall thru with her offering. every time we order from them our order is always wrong. i'd rather go to dominos !
113,2,Negative,"avoid this place! i ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20! ridiculous. no one that was making the pizza mentioned that each topping was extra. i started off with a $7.99 pizza! how in the world did those little toppings add $12.00! workers are all incompetent. i was shocked when i received my total. i told the cashier that all the other make your own pizza places don't charge extra for toppings. the cashier's response was uhhhhh i just moved here from out of state. he looked like a deer in the headlights. i told him i'm never coming back. no offer to keep a first timer happy or even get a manager after it was obvious that this was a deal breaker for me.

to be fair the pizza was good and the decor is very well done inside. go to mod or pieology instead."
114,1,Negative,"one of the very worst pizza hut's i have ever dealt with. they messed up my order, promised me a $15 credit in return, and then rob and tatiana refused to honor the credit. their customer service skills were laughable. rather than giving me a free cheese pizza, rob spent 15 minutes on the phone interrogating me. and tatiana seems to have never had a customer service job prior to this in her entire life. i ended up going to domino's pizza, where i got much better service for the same price."
115,1,Negative,"i've forgiven their rudeness over the phone many times, basically because i am able to order online. tonight my son forgot to order one of our pizzas online and they gave him so much grief about adding to the order that i finally took the phone. asked the guy if we could add to the order, or at least have 2 online orders delivered at the same time. i get on the phone and this jack wagon says ""it's not magic, ma'am!"" ummm not asking for magic. he hung up on me. solid business skills. cancelled my order and got dominos. learn some people skills, you idiots"
116,1,Negative,"a large pizza with sausage (more like pepperoni), mushroom and green peppers for 30$????  are you kidding me?"
117,1,Negative,nasty! i was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews.  just went to nyc in oct so wanted to compare.  sorry not ny style pizza.
118,2,Negative,"moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. tried this place out. family owned, which i like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. the single large pizza i ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and i took it home. it was plenty hot when i returned home, and that's great. the problem is.. it wasn't very good. the sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. i'd put it on par with papa john's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment."
119,1,Negative,"first visit to this location and am extremely disappointed.  sad to know who served me is now getting 10/hr. i know someone could provide a way better customer experience than this person did for the same amount of money.  if i was a business owner i'd be firing a crew like this as i'd lose out on business.  

first of all i arrived to find a hand drawn note on the door stating sorry we will open at 11, when they should have opened at 10:30a. 

second they opened after 11 and the guy had no customer service once he unlocked the door.  once i  entered nothing was said to me i simply stood near the register waiting to be acknowledged.  the guy decided to continue working behind the registers while his coworker stood around and snacked on something before i eventually was acknowledged.  

thirdly, once i was acknowledged the guy asked what he could get for me.  i said i would like 3 hot and readys please.  he said my total  and then walked away before i could pay .  i continued to wait while he left me at the registers and went in the back area.  

fourthly,  i waited over 10 minutes watching him stack up multiple pizza boxes with pizzas,   put stickers on pizza boxes,  placed finished pizzas in the warmers,  watched his co worker  had off a pizza to someone who just drove up to the drive through all while i still stood there waiting.  

fifthly, a third co worker eventually arrived and i asked her why that person received their order before me?
she went to the back and words were said between her and the coworkers and she just disappears.  

finally the guy brings me my order stands at the register and just stares at me... i ask him  oh are you ready for me to pay now??  he says yes and the total.  

if i didn't have  a hard working team i wanted to appreciate i would have just left.  i chose to go through this experience to the end and now here i am. . i hope the owners read this and take discipline on those employees.  if you don't believe me.  check your cameras."
120,1,Negative,"this pizzeria place is terrible. the service was rude and they refused to let us eat our food at the table due to ""health code rules"". we were told that we could eat outside! we were able to order drinks but were told rudely several times that we could not have our pizza until we left the premises. very unacceptable imho"
121,2,Negative,"i guess if you are truly desperate than this will serve a purpose. just don't keep your expectations high.

we had guests in town and they were gambling it up in the d and didn't want to leave. we just wanted to sneak away and slam dunk something quick so we weren't hungry. so, in that sense, it served its purpose.

we got the 5.99 ""special"" of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. the pizza was obviously microwaved and very much like ""michaelina"" type ""pizza"" you would buy in a grocery store. i mean..i held it down, but it was nothing special. the drink was pretty pitiful too...probably around the 12- 16 oz variety.

plus, how can you serve food and not have a public restroom? isn't that a violation of some sort??? seriously?

if you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into...

2 stars."
122,2,Negative,ordered two pizzas sunday about 1:20.  they told my wife it would be 45 min. after almost 2 hrs. the pizza showed up. we had called about 2:30 and asked where our pizza was. they told us it was in it's way and they would credit the money back to our card. pizza was cold and kids were starving. not calling them again.
123,1,Negative,"we tried to call ahead to order a pizza.  no answer after several attempts and we thought this may be because of monday night football.  my husband goes to pick up knowing he'll have to wait because they never ever have ""hot and ready"" any time of any day.  he places the order and the employee rings up the wrong thing.  my husband corrects him, and 3 or 4 orders are placed after my husband's order.  my husband watches the employee put the other orders in the oven.  he then comes over to my husband and again asks what it is he wanted.  my husband repeats the order.

after waiting and not paying close attention (mistake on his part, but then again...) the employee asks again what we wanted as he hands the box to my husband.  he of course comes home with the wrong product.  we had ordered the 5 meat pizza that is $9 in the tv commercials and received stuffed crust pepperoni.

we tried to call back and of course no answer.  this did not surprise us as we encountered this before going to the shop, and they did not even attempt to answer the phone while my husband was in the shop.  i shot off a message to the company while my husband made a return trip to try to rectify the situation.  i was told to take my comment to customer support.  i tried and the site froze on the 3rd page.  so, the whole company more or less ""backed up"" the bad service received at the shop.

upon return, the employee got sarcastic with my husband insisting the product received was correct even after seeing the evidence that it was not.  we were able to keep the mistake but only received a $5 pizza as more or less an apology when we had ordered a higher-priced product.  

in the end we received 2 incorrect products.  the first had to be reheated.  it was mediocre at best when eaten but now has me ill with heartburn and stomach cramps.  i guess it's safe to say both the pizza and the customer service have left very bad tastes in my mouth."
124,1,Negative,"i don't see the point. it is a mess and ugly which fair enough is not news to anyone but now prices are high and not competitive. the same pizza is cheaper at no frills, shoppers and lango's! and of course everything is strewn around in ugly fashion forget it"
125,2,Negative,"the service was fast. great pizza. however, as someone with a shellfish allergy, i find it frustrating that this is yet another restaurant where cross-contamination is apparently an issue to the point where everything is grilled together, fried together, and so on."
126,1,Negative,"worst service. overcharged - and lied to over and over again while the delivery guy tried to think of a reason to stick. there is no reason a medium pizza that's 14.99 on your website should come to $25 before tip - especially when that's not what i was quoted on the phone. 

my own fault for ordering from dominos in a moment of apartment packing craziness."
127,2,Negative,"hey sauce! 
i heard some friends talking about how great your pizza was so i took the wife out to your restaurant last night to give it a try. i thought i'd provide you with our feedback as i have a feeling many other people may be feeling the same way we did about our experience. lets start off with the good, the pizza was really good, our server was really good, the price of the food was decent, but that's kind of where it ends. our first real impression of the place was when we were handed our menu's, both our menu's were beyond greasy and dirty and had food stuck to them, they were dingy/had bent corners and some of the paper had ripped off both of the menus this is a sign that nobody cares to wipe down the menus, and if nobody cares to even wipe down the menus it makes me wonder what else do they not wipe down regularly. when sitting around and taking in the whole atmosphere of the place, we felt it was a little dark and the restaurant as a whole needed to be wiped down. the garlic knots were really good, i still have mixed feelings about them, because most places that sell garlic knots dust them in parmesan cheese powder and some sort of garlic powder, and that's what i was kind of expecting here, but here i got fresh parmesan cheese and fresh chunks of garlic on top, don't get me wrong fresh is great but it was an ongoing battle to keep the garlic chucks and parmesan on top of the knot while eating it, where as if it were the parmesan powder i feel it would have stuck better and not have been so much work. the sauce that came with the garlic knots was amazing. normally i like my garlic knots dipped in ranch, but i definitely liked your sauce over ranch last night. as far as your pizza goes it's really good. let me start by saying i haven't found a place in the vegas area that does pizza like yours, the thickness of the dough etc. we are transplants from california a little over a year ago and we've been on the hunt for a pizza with a crust like that. that's how 90% of all pizza places are in southern california do it so that's what we've grown to like. everything we have tried out here has seemed to try to spin off of new york thin style crust, so thank you for being a breath of fresh air for that. the pizza was hot when it came out as it should have, but for the life of me every slice i ate all the toppings would slide right off the crust, i felt like i might as well be eating a pizza casserole lol i thought that maybe everything was just too hot, but from the time i ate my first slice to the time i ate the last one, a good 15 minutes had passed and still the same situation. in regards to your soda glasses, you are using samuel adams pint glasses i think they were, these things were very frustrating, first of all not everyone likes beer and if you want to attract more families to your restaurant having every soda glass be a beer pint isn't very family friendly, but the most annoying part is every time i had a refill (at least 3 times) the ice was stuck in that center section and would drop to the bottom of the glass, just something to think about. over all i liked the food, but all the other issues combined really make me want to rate you as 2 out of 5 stars. i was really hoping your restaurant would be added as a ""usual place"" for my wife and i but i think it's going to be in the once in a blue moon category. i hope business continues to grow for you guys and that you can dial down these little things and thrive as a business. thanks again for the good food last night and good luck!"
128,2,Negative,"i love the pizza, but i've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. the first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (i think) were pretty bad. i had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. it was cold so we decided to eat inside. the smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. the pizza was good, but i don't think i'll be going back."
129,1,Negative,delivery was nice. fries had a bucket of salt on them. me and my brother gagged!!!hummus wasn't fresh. your sausage  pizza was rotten. tasted like mold...terrible terrible food!!!!
130,1,Negative,so i couldn't tell you what gus' pizza tastes like because they wanted a $7 service charge (before tip) on an $11 order to deliver anything.  classic craphole that will be out of business soon.
131,1,Negative,"this place is a wet, dirty diaper.
the dirty food matches its dirty neighborhood. 
their slow drivers on oxy can't figure directions from a mile away. when delivered, their pizza was lukewarm and tasted what i assume was old lady's socks. this food will give raccoons nightmares.
perfect food to give to an enemy or gf you are breaking up with."
132,2,Negative,"food was ok, not the best just ok. service could have been better, we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and garlic knots... they brought out everything and forgot the wings! and never even told us anything about how long it would be, we finished the pizza and knots before the wings even came! we where told that they forgot to put them in! bs! and the manager never even came over to apologize.... horrible customer service!"
133,1,Negative,"worst delivery service in the las vegas pizza market.  the first time i ordered pizza it took 1 hour and 30 minutes to get my pizza.  this time i ordered, told them on the phone i would pay cash and they show up and tell me they don't have change for my 2 twenty dollar bills.  really?  what a mess this place is.  i have no idea how they stay in business.  time for me to give some of the other places a try."
134,1,Negative,"pass this place- the food and service here were awful. 

we came into this place with a reservation when we arrived in vegas in september and right off the bat were not greeted at all. we should have known from there the experience would be bad. 

we sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food and drinks- after our drinks came, which were blah, our food  finally came. we ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs. 
the pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.

the meatball was just ok. nothing to write home about. 

when our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. she then said in a very rude tone that ""that is how it is and that is normal for all pizza"". i was offended with that remark. she has no idea what kind of pizza is normal if she thinks that was normal. 

any who, the manger came over and had a very similar attitude. 

we paid our expensive tab and left- never to return, as i urge you to do the same."
135,1,Negative,"the positives: staff was friendly and the beer was cold. that's it. 

two kids spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing. noodles were cooked fine, the meatballs were small and bland, and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the noodles let alone the entire plate. and for $6 each that's ridiculous. 


we order the mama's supreme pizza. the order took well over 30 min for the pizza. half the crust was burnt. the toppings were limited and the flavor was blah.  

very disappointed and won't be returning."
136,2,Negative,"the last time i was at hot rocks, i had the most interesting and delicious pizza experience.  if i had written a review that time i would have given it 5 out of 5.  oddly, i hadn't been back in quite a while until just recently.   

this time i ordered the macedonian  pasta with a starter green salad.  the salad was unique... but not good at all. it was waaayyy  overdressed. it tasted like every ingredient had been pickled  and then doused in lemon juice. i couldn't handle more than a couple mouthfuls before i gave up. 

the pasta... looked good.... sounded good.. but again was overdressed. there was so much dried basil in the sauce.. and instead of a light pesto.. the dish was swimming in oil. i'm not kidding. it was more like oil soup with penne noodles.  

i'm was supremely disappointed.  but i will say the service was excellent. the server did come by and asked how everything was but i didn't have the courage to send my food back... 

not saying this place doesn't know how to do pizza... and maybe i came on a bad night..  but i would be wary of ordering the pasta and salad."
137,2,Negative,"bleh.

maybe their pizza slices + pop deals are decent value, but my standard medium regular pizza (plus pineapple - yum!) was only a teeny tiny marginally fractionally  bit nicer than the same order at the neighbouring pizza pizza, but three dollars more expensive.

i'm also pretty sure one of the staff members who dealt with me was high. 

judge me all you like, but i'll head back to pizza pizza next time."
138,2,Negative,"if you're looking for cheap, i guess this is the place.  

they serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  there's a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.

the two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  they had a variety of pizza to choose from.  while the pizza looked really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.  it really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (i didn't see them making it, but i wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.

the place really isn't meant for ""pizza snobs"" to enjoy a quality pie.  it's meant to be a cheap alternative to mcdonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, ""macaroni and cheese pizza"" as one of the types).

there were teens and families with small children everywhere.  i was the only person not there with someone under 18."
139,1,Negative,"cashier takes my order for (the last of) cheese pizza while i wait in line to buy cigarettes. 
woman ahead is told her total, her response ""oh yea i forgot, can i get that cheese pizza"" 
why ask me if you're going to make me wait? i didnt forget to order, she did. she should have had to wait. university student vs an employee on a limited break. which was explained to her, minimum wage doesnt inspire much care for the customer... fuck this spot"
140,2,Negative,"first, it took about 5 minutes of waiting before we were even noticed. then the host told us just to sit wherever (why have a podium and a host if tou have open seating?) our host said it would be another 15 minutes because they stoke the fire at 4, but when we sat down our waiter said it would be 45 minutes. we waited and when we got our pizza it was extremely soggy, we couldnt even hold it without one hand on the bottom. our waiter only showed up once to half fill my water. overall not a good experience. go to a different grimaldi's"
141,2,Negative,the wait is ridiculous even for being busy. there was an hour before our pizza even went into oven. no pizza is really that worth it. i've had better.
142,2,Negative,"not impressed with this place at all!

i've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time.  the sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it.... very gross.  the gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible.  the maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular.   
and you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting.  i would pass on this one."
143,1,Negative,absolutely terrible service. our server was the most clueless guy. he told us that he didn't recommend the lasagna and the extra thin crust pizza. so i ordered anyways.  pizza was ok.  the lasagna tasted like the forest floor. this place is terrible.
144,2,Negative,"we ordered from this location last night for the first time in about 8 years. 

we got take out because we were busy and we wanted to take out some place close. we usually go to little joe's pizza as it is our favorite, but it would have been an additional 20 minutes and everyone was hungry now. 

on the phone, we ordered the family special. one large pepperoni and a large pineapple pizza with a side of cheesy bread sticks and a 2 liter bottle of pepsi. one we got home we discovered that their large size pizza was about 14"". little joe's pizzas large pizza is 16-18 inches so you can see our disappointment in the size of pizza huts pizza. the bread sticks were good. i liked their marinara dipping sauce. i didn't mind eating the pineapple pizza even though it seemed greasy and the crust was light and fluffy. the pepperoni tasted horrible which turned my husband off to ever ordering here again in any situation. 

i'm only giving it 2 stars due to the taste of the pepperoni pizza and the small size. for the same amount of money at little joe's pizza i could have fed 2 more people so i don't feel i got the best bang for my buck."
145,1,Negative,"we will never go to this sauce again. i ordered a salad and a pizza. we finished the salad and waited and waited for the pizza. i got up and asked the waitress if they forgot the pizza, she laughed and said yes that they forgot and it would be 10 min before we could get it.  she never apologized or offered to take some of the price off, nothing. just rude!!"
146,1,Negative,absolutely horrible!! messed up the order called back to get it fixed and they were rude about it... burnt the pizza and refused to replace it cuz a piece of it was missing... ordered a geek salad and was given italian and caesar dressing!! will not be ordering from them again!! terrible
147,1,Negative,"we ordered on a wednesday at around 5:30 pm. the order arrived by 6 and was fresh and hot. it was, however, missing the potato wedges which we called the store about. they were redelivered about 45 minutes later. after calling about the wedges (which my daughter really wanted, so she didn't eat), we realized one of the pizzas was missing half the toppings. decided not to call. the online ordering was good but does not allow for 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. not really family friendly.

sorry pizza 73, not gonna order again."
148,1,Negative,"i ordered one small pizza and one medium pizza directly off their menu with no special additions.  that is not what was delivered to my door.  this was late on a monday night too. not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.  

the real frustration came in trying to fix the order. after calling the place three times, i was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this.  they really need to work on the customer service. over two hours later i was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35.

while i can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since i ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks.  this place just lost my business. not worth the hassle.  i wish the best of luck to the rest of you!"
149,1,Negative,"i used to like their pizzas, but twice already i couldn't get in! first time, i get a rude employee saying that we aren't open! and tonight i rang the doorbell twice and i was ignored!

and another thing...why did you stop serving bacon on pizzas?"
150,1,Negative,"we ordered after edc last night, we got home and were starving and found their menu slipped under the door of our hotel room, it took over an hour to arrive, then when it got here it was 1 pizza short and we had 1 extra two-liter bottle of pepsi.

when we had ordered, the woman on the phone when we ordered, repeated our order back to us and it did include only 1 pepsi and 3 pizzas instead of the two we got.

i told the delivery guy we didn't order two bottles and he just gave me attitude and said: ""it's what the receipt says, it's just $3 more"".

i didn't care that it was just $3 more, my point was we did not want two pepsi's.

then when we called to complain the woman on the other end of the line also had a shitty attitude saying it wasn't their fault that they took the order wrong and that they're just human, mistakes happen.

they told us we could get the pizza we were missing but we would have to return the extra pepsi and pay the remainder of the cost of the pizza plus it would take another hour to arrive.

worst service and attitude ever."
151,1,Negative,"just got back! this is the third time in a row that pizza was burnt. not only mine but several others as well. also the garlic knots burnt. such a shame. i do not think i will be going back to this place now. how one cannot tell when something is burnt is beyond me. again this was the third time in a row.  heck, even the other person sitting at another table said their fries were burnt as well... open your eyes before you have no more locals coming!!!"
152,1,Negative,"what a freak show.  waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time.  another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter.  they carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm.  the guy he punched eventually waited on me.  i don't know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there.  great food.  creepy employees.  keep the recipe, get new help.  others witnessed this crap.  happened on thursday around 7:30 pm.  never again."
153,1,Negative,completely awful.   ordered a pizza and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the place was only 1/4 busy and they got it wrong twice.  we didn't realize the 2nd screw up until we got home.  we assumed after the 1st screw up and apology they'd get it right. the bartenders were dancing like they wanted to have fun but paid zero attention to our order.   will never go back.
154,1,Negative,order came cold and incorrect. ordered off grubhub. no fault with grubhub. won't order pizza from this restaurant again.
155,1,Negative,"i would like to give it no stars.  the pizza was burnt.  we ordered a cheese plate, and the only thing they got right was the olives (which is standard).  i had to ask for the flatbread that came with it.  we ordered one cheese and two meats... i got two cheeses and one meat and it wasn't even the meat that we ordered.  my cloth napkin had holes in it.  but the bartender is flirting with my boyfriend to make it right... this place sucks."
156,2,Negative,make sure you zero out the  tip area on your credit card slip when papa johns delivers ( used to be camfield corners now relocated to johnston rd.. )  .... 2 times now... someone between here & there added a tip to my debit card  purchase after getting a cash tip too.... i finally think hubby learned a lesson... !!!  papa johns offered us a couple free pizzas to rectify the situation.... ummmm no..... a 5 year customer has been lost ....and hungry howies has gained a new customer !
157,2,Negative,"nice people. very friendly.  provided some free garlic sticks while i waited for my pizza.  i took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    while the pizza was worth $10, i would've felt a little ripped off had i paid the normal price (closer to $18 i believe).  the dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- i found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places.  while there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just ""so-so"" such that i don't really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis.  such is the case here."
158,1,Negative,"ordered 2 larges. one all dressed one plain. received pepperoni instead of plain with giant air pockets. when called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy, i was told that it was a mistake. yes i agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with giant air pockets in it which is also 2 inches in diameter smaller than the large ordered in the box isn't a mistake, it was intentional. i have posted the picture. replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold. thank, never will we order here again."
159,1,Negative,"went here at 11:30 on a tuesday, most of their menu was not available. they said they had no toppings except cheese and pepperoni. the woman at the counter was not apologetic or anything. how can you advertise as a top vegas pizza place and only have two types of pizza a half hour after opening?

i'm vegan and we came here just for the pizza. not to pay for parking, walk all the way in and just get turned away. unacceptable. 

we asked if they'd have vegan pizza soon and they said ""maybe by dinner time.""

deserving of zero stars really."
160,2,Negative,"update:  i revisited the place today because i thought i'd give them a second chance, after all they are just opening.

their problem is that they haven't figured out how to do a wood-fired, thin-crust pizza.  while the toppings are very good, their pizza is greatly diminished because their crust isn't right.  great wood-fired crust should be a bit crisp on the bottom--but not burnt.  theirs is soggy.  i first went in during the evening.  this time i went in at lunch time.  there was a manager there this time who came by and asked how things were. i told her that the pizza wasn't great because the crust was soggy and tough.  she indicated that they weren't baking it long enough and would work with the cooks.  

imho, the difference between just average pizza and great pizza is in the crust.  it's easy to use fresh ingredients, not so easy to make a great crust.  this is where they are falling down.  hopefully time will tell if they get this one right, but for the cost ($15+) for a 6-slize pizza and a drink with a sub-par crust is too much to pay.

=====================================================================
it is obvious that the owners put a lot of money and effort into this place.  it is very nice inside.  the seating is comfortable and well decorated. 

however, decor alone does not a restaurant make.  when i first walked in i sensed a problem because the place smelled like burned popcorn.  i dismissed that and i ordered a pepperoni, kalamata and mushroom pizza.  pretty standard.  their first attempt came out with the crust totally cremated.  it was scorched on the top and incinerated on the bottom, yet the center was still raw.  i took it back and asked for a re-do.  the second attempt came out a little better, but the crust was just doughy, floppy as a dish rag and basically gross.   the toppings slid off into a pile of mush on my plate.  

i think the basic problem is that the place is being staffed by a bunch of young kids.  they have no idea what they are doing, and there is no management there to help.  they have a lot of money tied up in it,  and it is a shame that there is no one there to watch the shop."
161,1,Negative,"the pizza here is horrible. i've ordered it a few times because it's open 24/7 and let me tell you, it's bad. prices are great, but it doesn't make up for pizza that tastes like left over garbage dump pizza.

the delivery guys will never bring the pizza to my door. they make me walk out of my complex which is quite large. i order delivery for to the door delivery, not walk, balance two pizzas and a 2 liter while trying to type my door code in... no thanks.

i also had an issue, which will be my last time dealing with these idiots. i ordered a pizza, it was never delivered, and upper management is refusing to refund my credit card of the charge. they have been giving me the run around on the issue for over two weeks, and now they are flat out ignoring me, and refusing to refund me."
162,2,Negative,"i find that this pizza is edible but i am confused as to why so many people think it is so spectacular-it seems to be pretty standard delivery style pizza. they have a number of non-standard toppings and specialty pizzas so that might be part of the appeal to some but i prefer plain cheese or just one topping so the quality of the sauce, cheese and crust is most important. this pizza just seems very dough heavy to me which can result in sogginess-if you like thicker crust pizza you might like this place whereas if you like thin crust pizza you probably will not."
163,1,Negative,dominos is dominos. but when i walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. i had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after i ordered. this dominos is slow. drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. edit: our soda was flat. seriously go get ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one
164,1,Negative,"i guarantee this is the worst pizza you could ever get go to the supermarket buy a box of frozen pizza undercook it and there you have it the same taste you will get at this restaurant terrible disgraceful this should never be called the streets of new york because new york's pizza tastes nothing like this it is enormously much better in new york.

don't waste your money eating here"
165,1,Negative,pretty run of the mill bad pizza. tasted like re heated tombstone or other home made. but the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok.
166,2,Negative,"bad service, bland pizza, and really really overpriced. the whole night, we only saw our waitress maybe 3 times (not even busy, like four tables out of the whole place had people). with the pizza, there wasn't any pazzaz to it... very bland. and lastly; with two people and no appetizers or alcohol, the bill ended up being about $75. for those prices, i'd expect a much better experience. with service and food."
167,2,Negative,"take your pick: 
(sunday evening, party of 7)
-the absentee, surly waiter
-the water dripping from the a/c ducts into our heads
-the overly greasy pizza
-the ravioli literally sitting in oil
-the half-hearted oil & vinegar dipping mixture on the table
-the high prices
-the slow service, despite being one of only five parties dining
-the loud music that desperately screamed 'we're a cool restaurant...we promise!'"
168,2,Negative,"well i was hoping this place would blow my socks off, but alas, my socks stayed tightly in tact. i had been waiting for this place to open for a few weeks and been checking out the menu in the window and online (i'm at the golds every morning, not just a creepy window stalker). we finally got a chance to go a few weekends ago and man, was i disappointed. they were busy, which is expected on a friday night. we had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which we did but was super awkward. we ordered a few drinks and hit the menu. i ordered the deviled eggs and wifey got teh cheese plate. i went with the short ribs with blue cheese grits while wifey went with teh ricotta pizza with pork belly. the apps were done right, no complaints there. i liked the crispy bacon under the mix in the midle of the eggs, nice touch. the entrees, on the other hand, were sub par. my ""short rib"" dish was a large beef rib, and not a true short rib. i'm not that picky, but when i want short ribs, i want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky on a large stick. the glaze tasted good but after wrestling with the knife to cut off a few pieces, that was it. the grits were also bland, no blue cheese to be found. wifey's pizza should have read as pork belly pizza  and it would have been on point. now i know it sounds crazy to compain about too much pork belly, but the entire thing was pork belly and there was no ricotta to be found. it was also super salty and just not very good. the server comped my short ribs due to them being inedible, which was very gracious. i had high hopes for this place and will give it another shot. i'm hoping it doesn't go the way of st francis where it's got tons of potential, but simply can't deliver"
169,2,Negative,"ordered on my mobile app. when we got there, we paid and saw our pizza come out of the oven. waited 5 minutes before the guy behind the counter got around to give us our pizza that was clearly sitting on top of the oven. he was busy cleaning he said."
170,1,Negative,"man, does this place suck. trust the reviews! i ignored the negative ratings, and that was a mistake. i ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza with extra sauce. what i got: large pizza half pepperoni and half ham & pineapple with ""easy"" sauce?? this place is a joke. drive to a different one - it's worth the gas."
171,1,Negative,"stay away.  i'm a woman that just experience verbal assault by a sexist manager.

this is the most disturbing experience i've ever had. they completely messed up our pizza order, took an hour to deliver it then an hour to come back and reimburse us then wanted the whole pizza back as if we should pay for their mistake by not eating.  when we told them we had already eaten some of it they wouldn't reimburse us.

when i talked to the manager about it he was rude.  he talked over me, when i said this was not very good customer service he said ""so what"".  

the managers name is rick and he's sexist misogynist and a very bad man.  

also the food is terrible."
172,2,Negative,"so we recently moved to brookline and this place is just up the road. having a great pizza shop within walking distance is a great thing, unfortunately it is not this place... after two orders of undercooked pizza we tried a final time tonight and specifically asked for the pizza ""well done"" hoping that way it would come out cooked correctly. sadly this was the most undercooked yet and since neither of us enjoy raw dough we won't be back.."
173,1,Negative,"ive eaten here twice now. both times were a great disappointment. first time i ordered pizza it was burnt so badly i couldnt eat it. 
the second time i ordered the meatballs and pasta. the sauce is so bland it makes store bought taste great ! 
please do yourself a huge favor and try one of the many other restaurants in town. you will thank me later."
174,2,Negative,"been going to nello's for years, but after last night, i'm taking some time off and spending my pizza $ elsewhere.  not crowded, table for 3 in the bar....2 entrees came out quickly while i waited for a woodfired pizza.  my wife's salad was missing the pancetta as advertised.  my pizza finally arrived but was made incorrectly...i was told no problem, we'll make another one....waited, waited and bingo another wrong pizza - this time it wasn't even close. after 2 hours i asked for the check and i'm gone.  nello's get it together please and do something about your pizza dough - it's like cardboard lately.  headed to florencia for a while....and so is my $."
175,2,Negative,what to say about this place didn't really get a try the pizza too much after waiting 40 minutes for the food they made it wrong the couple bites that i had i was not impressed at all italian beef that's horrible i think i could have got better sandwich at arby's the greek salad was very small mediocre dressing had no flavor the tomato soup tastes like something out of a can overall very disappointed only thing it made it worthwhile was the manager comp in the mail and sending us home with a spinach pizza tried that one was not very good but thanks to the manager i will give it another chance maybe in a few months after they've been open for a while
176,1,Negative,this is a pizza 73 place with a different name same crap pizza and same horrible wings just like 73 only you pay more money for the pizza here then at 73 and it's the exact same product plus it took them one and half hours to deliver it to my  place 10mins away on a wednesday night i'm  being generous with the 1 star rating
177,2,Negative,i've been here twice now. the first time i wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke. i ended up only ordering a shake. i went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running). i was not impressed. i'm not sure what was weird about. the sauce? the cheese? i've had way better pizzas. loved the milkshake. i give it two stars because my husband likes it and i have to tolerate it for him.
178,1,Negative,"i feel bad giving this place such a bad review based on my experience a couple of months ago, and never usually dislike places this much, but here i am.  i am a resident of the bloor/kingsway area in which this restaurant is situated.  now if you know the strip of bloor where this restaurant is, you know that every second place is a restaurant, and they are all pretty busy.  with the selection of restaurants in this area and other italian restaurants in etobicoke (just go to la veranda around the corner!!) i don't know how this place stays open based on my experience.  there is just so much better italian in etobicoke to be had.

anyways, i have been here twice.  the first time was something like 2 or 3 years ago with a friend for a casual dinner and i think i may have had a salad or something.  i don't really remember my experience, i just remember i wasn't unhappy with it and generally enjoyed the experience and decor of the restaurant. but this review isn't based on that.

so a couple of months ago my boyfriend and i were craving italian and wanted to go somewhere close by.  i wanted to go somewhere new and my boyfriend hadn't been there before.  being a creature of habit, he wanted to go to la veranda around the corner which is an etobicoke failsafe of ours but i insisted on coming to sempre.

my boyfriend went to culinary school and is a sous chef at a very busy italian restaurant in toronto and he really found the menu to be lacking.  he wasn't super hungry and ordered a pizza.  i ordered a pasta (don't remember what it originally was now) which took a super long time to come (even though it wasn't very busy), and when it finally came out i noticed that it really did not seem to match the description of the pasta that i had ordered.  i recall that when giving my order to the waitress she seemed slightly confused with what i had asked for even though what i had ordered was right there on the menu, and i didn't ask for it with any changes or anything.  i recall the pasta i originally had ordered was supposed to have a white sauce and the one i received had a rose sauce, as well as being tortellini.  i was honestly so hungry at that point and not one to complain anyways that i just decided to eat it.  well, if what i had received had turned out to be good i wouldn't have been too unhappy but i honestly would equate the pasta and sauce to some crappy wedding banquet hall food.  the tortellini had no flavour and tasted like something i could have boiled at home from a package from costco.  the pasta was definately not made in house.  the sauce was probably the worst part and made me dislike it so much.  it was just too thick, had no flavour, and just so reminescent of crappy banquet hall food and generally unpleasant.  the pizza was not up to par of what you would expect to find from an italian resto in toronto, had not much sauce and the crust wasn't great.  

there are tons of options along the bloor strip, if you really want italian skip this and go to la veranda around the corner."
179,1,Negative,"something has changed for the worse here.  we are long time regulars and i have to agree with erica v that on the last two pizzas the crust has been soggy / gummy and the sauce was runny / watery even when ordered well done and crispy.  so much so i called the manager last night. this used to be good pizza but sadly no longer. they've either changed ingredients, recipes and/or chefs.  last week's sausage pizza tasted like bagged hospital grade meat."
180,1,Negative,"i always get good pizza from here. 

tonight i called in my order and drove down to wait for it. as i was sitting waiting in front of the big glass window,  a driver pulls up, walks in and when the other guys went to the back he grabbed some chicken pieces and shoved it in his mouth. then he proceeded to stick every one of his fingers into his mouth up to his knuckles. i'm not exaggerating. then he wipes his mouth with the same hand. then his nose, then he did his fingers again. then his nose again. and his fingers one last time. 

 i thought he would at least wash his hands, but then he grabbed someones wings then he took a pizza did something with it then put the order out for pick up. i walked in real quick and asked the guy who just walked up to the counter if that order is mine, he said no i said good because if that is mine i don't want it. i told him what happened and he told the guy to wash his hands..... i feel bad for the people who had this guy deliver their food tonight around 6:15pm. yuck"
181,2,Negative,"hit or miss. the first time i went the food was amazing so much so i i went back for a second time in a week. the first time i got a 'build your own pizza' with alfredo sauce and chicken. the second time i ordered the same thing and they forgot the alfredo but put it on the side, okay fine it was still good. today, i ordered food to pick up and ordered the same pizza for a third time. i was told they didn't have alfredo sauce for pizza only white garlic or red sauce (even after having it twice!)  i asked if they could put the alfredo on the side like the did before, the woman taking my order said they could ( i don't understand why it can be put on the side and not the pizza.) i picked up the food and brought it home and the ""alfredo"" was literally warm milk with salt at the bottom literally! needless to say, i'm beyond angry. the quality has gone down consistently since my first visit, i won't be returning."
182,2,Negative,"i lost a little faith in this city by how celebrated this place is. serviceable at best. cheese blend is highly questionable, mine was rubbery really. crust was ok. if you think this is the ultimate then i question your dedication to pizza consumption.

ps: the spot is cash only, which is also annoying."
183,1,Negative,"do not!!!!! order through romano's pizzeria. horrific customer service. i was told that i would not be refunded my $20 order...  for my extremely cold pizza that they said was fresh out the oven. the pizza felt like it had been sitting out for a few hours ... that's absolutely disgusting.... the manager refused to refund me $20... 
i waited in my car with my 2 month old new born for almost an hour!!!! to get an extremely cold disgusting pizza. again what horrific customer service. we had to buy an alboa pizza to sastify our  pizza craving...  i would highly recommend not ordering through this disgusting horrific cold gross pizza place. they don't care about what they serve you. & again the customer service was absolutely terrible!!!!! my pooor new born child having to wait in the car for over an hour because they didn't have their times right. for a disgusting cold pizza that not even my dog would eat. if you want awful gross pizza then this is your place ... other then that spend your money elsewhere. would never recommend this place to anyone!!!!! in this lifetime."
184,1,Negative,"i came in to the restaurant at 4:30pm. it was mostly empty, however the service was slow and inattentive. 

i ordered the clam pizza and am sorry i did. the only clams on the pizza were 1-2 still in the shell on each slice. you had to scrape them out yourself. i would rather eat my pizza rather than work for it. furthermore, this resulted in very little crab meat on the pizza. lastly, there were clam shells broken off and melted into the pizza. they were hard to see. thus, there were 2-3 bites i literally has to spit out as i was chewing clam shells. 

when i pointed this out to the waitress amanda she said sorry and she would tell the chef. she even admitted that this was not the first time this has happened. despite my complaint there was not an offer to deduct a portion of the bill or offer of free dessert or something to compensate. 

disappointing."
185,1,Negative,"just got delivery from here and wtf... ordered the half sheet pizza and at some point it was evidently sideways from there to here. we got 2 toppings on one side, 2 on the other and when we opened it, about 1/4 of the pizza was ""mine"" as the other ingredients had slid over. this in itself might not be a problem - i could maybe give it an ""eh, whatever,"" but then in taking 2 bites, i knew that for how greasy the pizza was, if i ate it my digestive system would be in for a cleansing if you know what i mean. 

i called them back and said i wanted my credit card refunded. she had to call the owner. the driver promptly came back with a ""transaction voided"" receipt and i was told that the amount would be credited to my account within 2-3 business days. oh, and incidentally, they even asked us to return the 2 liter of soda - so we had to pour it back into the bottle from our glasses. i should have said i was keeping it for the inconvenience, but you know, whatever. 

needless to say i will not be ordering from nunzio's again."
186,2,Negative,kinda disappointing. it was a late night pick and kinda wanted to send it back. the veggies and meats on pizza was delicious but the crust seem pre-made and the cheese and sauce had no flavor.
187,1,Negative,this is pretty bad pizza. we ordered because it could be delivered to hotel  ...tastes like cardboard very light on toppings...i would never order again. i think it might be frozen digorno. the salads were lettuce w three tomato slices..some of lettuce was turning.
188,2,Negative,"this review is based my latest experience. i have always ordered from magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. i ordered hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. now magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  i used the eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. the food arrived 15 minutes later.  so it took 10 minutes to cook the food. doesn't pizza take longer to cook? the bell peppers were missing from the pizza. it must  have been pre-made. the fingers were greasy and tasted weird. i should have taken a picture. the fries were good. had to throw the fingers out. won't be ordering from there for a while."
189,1,Negative,"ordered and picked up two pizza's tonight, asked for extra sauce on them. no extra sauce on either and didn't get much cheese on one of them that was suppose to be half cheese half sausage. called and spoke to saba the manager and he said it was my fault for ordering extra sauce, ""the cheese sucked up the sauce"". what?! refused to replace. never had this problem before. not worth $45 i spent for two pizza's."
190,1,Negative,"so yeah, i'm reviewing a chain. i wanted to try the ""new and improved"" domino's pizza. everything those commercials said about their old pizza was true-- cardboard crust, ketchup sauce, bad toppings. so, is the new domino's better than the old? 

yes, but that's not saying much-- it moves up from negative stars to 1, perhaps1.5 stars. the cheese and toppings are much improved. the cheese abundant and tasty and the mushrooms were thickly sliced whole brown mushrooms. really good. the sauce was a bit salty and bland-- not horrible, but nothing to write home about. 

they still have a problem with the crust. the crust on both mediums we ordered was mushy and underdone. while it wasn't as blatantly offensive as old domino's crust, it still had a lingering aftertaste like those bisquick pancakes mom used to try to feed us in the 1970s. add to that an abundant dusting of garlic salt and you've got a taste reminiscent of your first boyfriend's attempt to make you an ""italian"" dinner with garlic bread. i had no idea they even made garlic salt any more. it hasn't improved. 

so, the pizza has improved, but not enough for me to ever eat it again."
191,1,Negative,i normally order pizza from this location on a regular basis. i would carry out but this was my 1st time having it delivered...i completed my order at 7:00 it was confirmed on the delivery tracking that the order would be delivered at 7:37 well i did not get my order until 8:15. almost 40 mins after the tracker staled that i would have my food. the pizza was cold and my wings were under cooked. i called the establishment and was told i could get a free pizza :( the manager stated that she would used this as a coaching opportunity for her drivers. honestly that is not my issue. it will be a while before i return here.
192,1,Negative,seriously the worst service i have ever got in my life . we called in to order a pizza and the kid on the phone couldn't even figure out how to take my order then i told them 3 different times we had cash and to please bring change for it . you think they brought change ? nope they tried to give us change back as if we were tipping the kid 20$ for the delivery . 3 timesssss i told them .  horrible cold pizza too i will never eat with pizza hut ever again . ever!!!
193,1,Negative,"went in for lunch, looked good so i ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, and some garlic parmesan fries. they burned the pizza and under cooked the fries. but to top it off, the order came to $10.27(pricy but whatever its vegas), and i gave them a dollar tip (wrote on the reciet and even totaled it out for them). when i went to check my bank account, they charged me $12.32... i hate to be anal about one dollar, but they did not deserve it and it was blindly taken from me, from right under my nose. the woman cashier was nice but the gentleman cook seemed like an asshole and gave me a sassy look when i asked for a side of ranch. no mention of the ranch costing extra or anything.. i would of paid for it.. assuming it cost a dollar.. i guess i did pay for it. whatever, last time i visit them."
194,1,Negative,one star because i can't tell you if the pizza is any good because every time i call they put me on hold.  first time 10min so figured they forgot i was on hold. so hung up &  called back when they asked if they could put me on hold i said no &  they put me on hold anyway.
195,2,Negative,"if you think this is good pizza, you need to get out more. i tried two kinds: the bronze dragon and the breakfast pizza. i honestly couldn't tell you which was supposed to be which. maybe it was because the line was long, but the crust was underdone and too doughy, and the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink. i'm not from the midwest and i have yet to find pizza that even comes close to what i'm used to in pa/nj/ny."
196,1,Negative,"ok, so i've been ordering from this location for months now and each time the delivery service is getting worse. im at the point that i will not order from then anymore and will not tell anyone of my family or friends to order from them ever after today. i ordered their $25 coupon of 2 large 2 topping pizzas and 20 wings today. i placed this order at 12:35 pm and as told it would take an hour for delivery(which seemed a bit excessive at this time of day. since it was after lunch rush). so as the hour mark came and then went the order was still not here. at 20 minutes after the hour it was still not here, so i called them to ask where my order was since its now been an hour and 20 minutes. the girl on the phone proceeds to go on to tell me that the order was out for delivery and quickly got off the phone. so again i sat outside waiting and again another 10 minutes went by and no order. i called back again and this time the girl put me on hold to see where the delivery girl was at. she came back on the line and tried to tell me that there was traffic that delayed the driver and that she was less then 5 minutes away. now that began to irritate me since they are only 3 miles from where i live. there's not that much traffic that would delay a delivery by 30 minutes. the girl just kept saying she was sorry and never offered up any comps of any kind to show any customer appreciation to keep me as a customer. i then asked her what they were going to do to compensate me for not having my food by an hour and a half. she then says oh well i can give you a $10 credit on your account for your next order. i said fine and hung up expecting my order in under 5 minutes as they claimed. well that was a lie yet again as it took the driver an additional 12 minutes to finally show up. so now its been an hour and 42 minutes; the driver got out and acted like nothing was wrong. she asked ""hi how's your day going?"" i responded with ""it would have been better if my order was here over 40 minutes ago, on time."" she then got very snotty quick and snapped ""well there's only one of me and your total is $30.58."" i said ""well i would like to check to see if my food was still hot before i pay for it."" she pulled out one pizza and handed it to me and i checked it. granted it wasnt as hot as all my other orders from before but it was warm enough that i went ahead and paid for it. i then handed the driver $40 and she said ""let me get your change."" the change should have been $9.42 she came back and handed me only $9 not even saying sorry i don't have any change, change she just assumed she could keep the 42 cents and hesitated like i was going to give her more for a tip.  well now i'm seeing red so that's all she got as her tip was the 42 cents she assumed she could just keep and i walked away from her. this whole delivery was the worse experience i have ever had from this place. they acted as though my order didn't matter in any way. they acted like they were irritated with me for being upset for not having my food for over and hour and 40 minutes. it will be awhile before i order from them again if i do decide to."
197,1,Negative,"i ordered sophia pizza and i was expecting a delicious food with proper spice. what i ended up eating was testing horrible , super spicy which burned my mouth. i couldn't even have the second slice. the funny thing is we checked the menu to see if there was any indication of the spiciness of the food! no! nothing . i'm assuming they just dropped the bottle of pepper in the pizza hoping no one will notice."
198,1,Negative,"bad service and never enough cheese pizza, this place used to be good but it's gone downhill."
199,2,Negative,"i've ordered late night delivery for pizza, pasta ans wings as an experiment. everything sucked. i will never order from them again."
200,1,Negative,"i ordered there brooklyn style philly cheese steak pizza. i asked for them to put the  garlic crust but i guess the forgot. when i opened up my pizza box i was extremely disappointed  there was little to no meat on the pizza litterly only about two slices had meat on a large pizzs... wtf i did order a philly cheese stake.  know $23 latter and still dissatisfied.
with so many other pizza options around idk if i will be back."
201,2,Negative,"if you love lou malnatis like i do, you will be very disappointed by this pizza. we ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. the pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to lou's!"
202,1,Negative,"just dined here this evening. i have to say this place had hands down the worst service i have ever received. party of 3 adults, the server suggested we order 3 pizzas and an appetizer. we were not interested in their limited appetizer menu so we decided to skip it and ordered the pizzas. it took 45 minutes to get the food, i know they bake it fresh so i was willing to wait but the pizzas were bland and overpriced. and we had 1 and 3/4 pizza left, her suggestion of 3 pizzas was far too much food. honestly, i would skip this one."
203,2,Negative,"we had heard some good things about this place....so we were excited.  however, it's sub-par at best.  service was slow and rude....a rarity in this part of wisconsin, and the pizza was edible but i don't understand why people think it's that good.  we won't be back."
204,2,Negative,"i have been to custom built 3 times now the first time was before my yelp days and i boosted all over facebook about it. i let all my friends and family know how awesome of a place it was as well as how awesome the customer service was. i think things have changed since then. 

allow me to elaborate, the second time i went to custom built i quickly left the restaurant and choose not to dine there because i was turned off by this one employee today i went back and have found that the employees name is larry. the time i walked out was because larry was on the phone in the back and came out front to greet us. when he came out he was holding his cell phone in his hand and asked to wait a second as he finished his call, we didn't see this as a problem so we patiently waited. when larry returned he had his cell phone in his hand and was hanging it up he placed the phone on a back counter came to the front and asked what type of dough we would like to choose. he quickly grabbed a regular ball of dough and was about to start kneeding it when i stopped him and apologized to him and told him loud and clear that i could not dine at his establishment since i did not see him wash his hands and we walked out. bummed out by the incident i still did not want to simply stray away because of one employee so i told my wife we would give it some time and try again.

well we did and we re-tried today. like i said previously today the same employee that i walked out on was there and he was at the door. i take it that he did not remember the incident as he did not even recognize me. i thought that was great so that i could try and get a new experience and try and forget about the previous incident. i have to say the evening staff that first introduced my wife and i to custom built was exceptional they were up beat and seemed excited to just make a pizza. today it felt like it was monday and things were just crawling. if it was not for that one awesome employee that was genuinely happy to be at work i would have walked out once again that employee's name is moe and the first thing that he did when he saw us and asked us the dough we wanted was go to the sink and wash his hands!! i quickly pointed it out to my wife and said look at that exceptional employee that is washing his hand prior to preparing our food. moe quickly keeded out the dough and placed it on the order line to get prepared. excited by a happy employee this made me happy and i quickly remembered the first time i went to custom built. i said to the gentlemen that was preparing my pizza the first time i came here the young man that assisted me suggested to try and get creative instead of having the same mundane pizza. he suggested trying multiple sauces and i remember him saying you can split this pizza into 16th's to try and give us a challenge we love challenges. when i mentioned this to the guy that was helping me today he seemed a little put off by the whole thing and even said i don't know why he would suggest trying so many different things. i ordered the pizza in 3rds so that i could try the different sauces 1 pesto 1 alfredo and 1 spicy. the guy seemed very uncertain on how to spread the sauces in thirds so he just made circles that ended up bleeding into each other in the cooking process. i layered and layered my pizza with topping after topping after topping. i always have fun in that part i feel like i'm a kid again when i get to pick and choose. 

my wife placed he order and i went to pay. when i was paying larry was at the cash register and i told him that i forgot my belly card but had received the message that all custom built pizzas were 6.95 for the month of april. he said ok and then i showed him my yelp 10% off for checking in for the first time he again shook his head to which i thought was a clear sign for him acknowledging it. i paid the tab and was just handed my change. i thought that was a bit odd so i asked if i could have my receipt. larry printed a receipt and gave it to me, i say a receipt because i was unsure if it was actually mine i paid with a $100.00 bill and did not nee that on the receipt and i also did not see a discount. i didn't want to be rude and be like yo! where my discount son!! so i just kept quite and said to myself the food will clearly change my mind and it will be worth every penny.

well i got my pizza and it was totally not what i expected the sauces had all bleed into each other and i could not tell the difference from what was pesto what was spicy and where the alfredo started and ended. also today i watched as larry was at the cash register and then went to make a pizza for a guest with out washing his hands again!!!! some one needs to go over safe food handling with larry before he gets someone sick!! 

i don't know if i can try custom built again and i was a fan :(!"
205,1,Negative,"my last visit

placed a ""to go"" order 3 small pizzas, 2 with pepperoni and 1 with pepperoni and sausage, all with asiago flavored crust. i walked in to hungry howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty.  however, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge i was there and  to get my order. 

the pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas i have ever had from hungry howies and the order wasn't even correct. i wish i would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store.  i called hungry howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn't correct.  the associate who answered the phone response was ""sorry bout that, not sure who cooked it.  i guess we can cook another"".  after waiting another 20 minutes to cook another pizza i head back up to hungry howies and yes, once again my order wasn't correct (wrong flavor crust). since i wasn't willing to wait another 20 minutes i took the pizza and headed home.

my previous experiences with hungry howies has always been hit or miss. i think i will drive a little further to one of the many other pizza places in my area."
206,1,Negative,"o stars an option? 

used to come here years ago as a young child, raced all kinds of laps weekly (first opened). over the years this place has gone down hill! the owner and his son are douchers, cocky, and selfish. they don't care about their employees just their customers that are giving the creedy individuals money on some sort. this place is way too over priced for some childish electric carts, buy some (real) gas go-karts.. and take one for a real race. the employees are unprofessional, they stand around the counters on their phones, and don't pay attention to the race track for a second set of eyes. 

they don't wear gloves cooking pizzas

you're better off going to fast lap or somewhere else with gas go-karts, and more reasonable prices!"
207,1,Negative,"as a native chicagoan i grew up going to giordano's  as well as the other top chicago style pizza joints.  i know good chicago pizza - this is not it!  the pizza was undercooked and frankly gross.  my husband, myself and my daughter could not eat it.  we even thew out our leftovers the moment we got home.  they are doing chicago style pizza a disservice.  the chopped salad was delicious.  the mozzarella triangles were great.  the wait for a table was minimal.  the wait for the pizza was 45 mins as expected.  the restaurant was nice.  the staff was nice.  the high chair was even clean (harder to find then you think).  but if a pizza place can't put out amazing pizza, nothing else matters."
208,1,Negative,"a couple weeks ago, my friends and i arrived in phoenix, starving, at about 1am with a 12 hour layover. we shuttled to a motel and discovered our only options were jack in the box drive-thru (no car) and gus's. i'm not going to credit this place with an elaborate review. i didn't know pizza could taste this bad. i mean how do u mess up a pizza. i am not a food critic and i am not picky by any means. my friend could only stomach two slices and he can eat! the pizza was flavorless, tasted like water just like one other reviewer mentioned and upon swallowing, the cardboard box seemed the more edible of the two. i'm not even kidding. 
i must also mention the price. i know beggars can't be choosers. i don't mind paying out the ear for a edible meal when it's a last resort. 
we paid $50. and change including $5 tip for the ""two gnarly pizzas and disgusting chicken wings special"".   
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee."
209,2,Negative,"pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. they don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  i don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered."
210,1,Negative,last night my family at cicis  pizza.  we hadn't eaten in this restaurant for about a year and boy have they changed.  the restaurant is under staffed.  we went up to the counter quite a few times and there were not any pizza's.  it's hard to believe you go to a pizza buffet and no pizza.  we waited 20 minutes for a desert pizza to be made.  there were a few people working really hard but they needed more people.  the floor had old napkin and it took quite a few minutes for the 1 person to take our used plates away.  we will never go back.
211,2,Negative,"pizzas are salty. all the time every time. i don't know why 
my kids think it's gonna be better next time. no matter what kinda of pizza it's going to be salty. they also use cheddar cheese on most pizzas.  the salads are good and we have had the pablo picasso a couple of times.  the dirty monkey drink i ordered was mostly ice so the next one i ordered i asked if i could have ""light ice"" and when she brought me this the glass was just over half full to ""compensate"" for the ""light ice"".  this was odd in my opinion. the first dirty monkey i had was so full of ice that it was all that hit my lip as i drank it."
212,1,Negative,"thought i'd give them one more chance, tonight still zero hot and ready pizzas and now the customers are stealing sauces when the cashier leaves the counter, which is more often than she's there."
213,1,Negative,"doughy pizza with a bad sauce. 

plus i ordered mozarella sticks and they did not deliver them, charged me for them, and refused a refund. 

do not support this business."
214,2,Negative,"i'm giving them one star because they produce pizza that is among the best in the city and another star because they've proven that corsa italia can support a dinning scene that is kicked up a notch.  
the prices are a little high for what they offer and the service could be given some pointers and from what i've seen and read on other sites from past employees, the proprietors and management can use an attitude adjustment.  a server belittled the busboy in front of us once when the busboy brought to me a glass of wine that was only half full.  another time our white wine was room temperature.  we brought it up with our server who reminded me of yosemite sam and wouldn't have looked out of place at a tea party rally informed me that white wine is served at a higher temperature than beer.  yes, thank you tips, now can you please replace my 22 degree wine.  while he did correct the situation in the end, we received the cold shoulder the rest of the evening.  when it came time to paying our bill there was a drink missing from it, we informed him and while we didn't expect him to kiss our feet, didn't receive much more than a, ""uh, ya, thanks."" then printed us a new bill.  
there are many new pizzerias that have opened up with great service and while i appreciate their contribution in terms of atmosphere and food, snooty ""qsa"" isn't what st. clair west needs."
215,2,Negative,the pizza is ok nothing to brag about and the service sucks had to go to the counter to get my drinks refilled and they looked at me like i had three heads.
216,1,Negative,"this place has great pizza but my experience with this location has been awful. they either take over an hour to get you a pizza or they don't deliver it at all. the first time i tried to order a pizza from here they ended up being closed because of a management issue and i never got my pizza (i never got charged) but i also had to wait an hour and a half before realizing it was never coming.

the second time i ordered we had to call about delivery and they had the address written down as camelflower instead of camelback. took about 90 mins. 

the third time i tried to order a pizza it took 90 mins before it was delivered and that was only after i called to check in on it. they gave me a free pizza credited to my account as a result. 

now, i'm sitting here waiting for yet another pizza that was quoted as being delivered in 45 mins.. it has been 90 minutes, again. we called to check in on the pizza (see a trend?) and they said they only had one driver. now, i'm wondering if my pizza is going to be cold. 

bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (i could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). if you're wondering why domino's or pizza hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the art of pizza delivery. either figure your system out, or give it up. 

if you're wondering if you should try this place then you should drive to the location and enjoy the food. don't wait for your pizza to be delivered. you might starve."
217,1,Negative,"golly, i would tell people not to go here. i simply ask for four pizzas, two with pepperoni, one with olives, and one with pineapple. they gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. i can't eat meat. i was with another person, who didn't mind the other topping on his pepperoni. i went back to let them know they made a mistake. i was charged for two more pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. i saw someone tell the cook, how the pizzas should be made. once i got my two pizzas, they had pepperoni with olives and pepperoni with pineapples. again! i was on lunch, there was no point for asking to fix this problem again because i had to go back to work. brought it up to them, ask them if i could just get my money back since i can't eat the pizzas they made me. i was told i could not get my money back only credit. i don't want credit because that was my lunch money to eat. i was told by the employees,""mistakes happen."" after i ask for my money back. which i understand mistakes do happen, i work in customers service too. but when i see an employee tell the cook how the pizzas should be made, one with only olives and one with only pineapple, and both pizzas still end up having pepperoni on it. that's not just a mistake. which i still have the receipt that's says cheese pizzas with olives and pineapple."
218,1,Negative,"do not eat here!!! i purchased a groupon deal for family meal: large cheese pizza, 20 wings, 2 l soda. worst pizza ever!!we ordered over the phone and picked up the order.it was so greasy, the oil soaked through the box onto my car seat. the flavor is so-so-similar to frozen. the cheese was low quality, the crust was blahh, and the worst part: the sauce was thinly spread.the wings were hard, dry, and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.the soda was the only thing our family can use. we also ordered manicotti,some beach title pizza, and garlic knots. manicotti was okay. beach pizza was same as cheese pizza with only meager toppings thinly spread out. the garlic knots were hard enough to toss like a rock.we had to order from papa john's.it is so true: if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is.."
219,2,Negative,"i think i expected more from this place because its supposed to be ""new york"" pizza and the decor of the restaurant is decorated very new york-ish.  but i guess it is new york style, thin crust, sliced pizzas ready in the display window... but as for the taste, yeah not so much.  

the couple times i ordered pizza from there, the crust was semi burned with black burn spots on the crust and on the bottom.  the cannolis were just ok and smaller than others i've had.  

maybe i'm just comparing it too much to the ""real thing"" and being biased.  word of advice:  less than a mile down the road is rocco's ny pizza... definitely go there instead!!!"
220,1,Negative,"no place settings - had to steal from empty table.  dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? frozen pizza kinda quality. salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce."
221,1,Negative,"bad experienced everrrr!!! never in my life have complained to any businesses but this domino's pizza have the bad service and take forever to have the order ready! took me about  1 hour and 45 minutes (or more) to have my order ready! and gave me attitude!!! what kind of service is thissss????? would never come back here again! ever. 

it deserve 0 star but no choice! anyhowwww, the foods are fine though. if you ever consider ordering pizza from this place. just call in and come pick up in 2 hours! many people were complaining and cancelled orders!!"
222,1,Negative,"im usually not this kind of guy but sometimes a business deserves to be publicly slammed for a solid pattern incompetence...there isn't a -4 rating??? so i ordered 5 deep dish pizzas, 2 cheese and 3 pepperoni... pretty simple right? hard to really screw that up i would think? 
i don't know how hard it is to actually take an order and see it through because i've never worked there but i think it would be easy with computers n stuff, or a pen and paper idk maybe it is a hard job..? 
anyway i had someone go pick the order up, he didn't know exactly what i ordered but when he came back i ended up with 4 pepperoni pizzas and 1 cheese... 

****this has been five times in a row they have completely givin me a different order i hope the world sees this and avoids the place, drive down the road a bit further and go to another ceasars, trust me it's worth the gas****
so that's that, ya lost a customer obviously ya don't care because the last two times i got the wrong order i brought it to their attention but yet you all still manage to keep a strong track record of screwing up the most important part, the order!"
223,1,Negative,"i just tried to order a pizza for delivery and got a phone call from the general manager saying that they don't deliver to where i live in deforest.  except they delivered to my house within the last two weeks!  the manager argued with me saying they never have and told me they don't have record of any orders from my phone number, which i updated when i last ordered online and on their delivery map my address is included.  he basically called me a liar to my face, even though the pizza box from their last delivery to my house is still in the garage waiting to go out with the recycling.  if you changed your coverage area fine, but don't be a jerk to a customer and call them a liar.  i have a medical degree and am not some confused idiot.  then i got an email saying that my order was being made.  the manager said that they don't deal with online stuff in their store.  someone needs to get on the same page and be consistent.  worst customer service i've experienced in years!  i will never order from this franchise nor any other in the area and will be sure to pass along to my friends how they treat customers.  i was so excited to find out they delivered here only to be disappointed.  it's a shame too, because their gluten free pizza was pretty good.  save yourself the grief and go to salvatore's tomato pie's instead.  way better pizza and way nicer people!!!"
224,1,Negative,"customer service from the order taker and driver were decent, but this place serves really, really terrible food. i should have known, but i was drawn by what i thought was an awesome coupon deal. you know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? that's not the case here. it reeked of onions.

the pizza was undercooked and bare. i had the supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. also, i never thought anyone could screw up buffalo wings. it's just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn't even do that. the wings looked unsauced and when i asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. after a closer inspection i understood, and it was right then and there that i realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. the wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. that was most likely the case. i tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future.

i am hoping i can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. i wish i could get a refund, but i don't want to put up a fight just to hear that they won't provide one. potential customers, please do yourself a favor and stay clear; the only valuable thing you'd be ordering here is a life lesson."
