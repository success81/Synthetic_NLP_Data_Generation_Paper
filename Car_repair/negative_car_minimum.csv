60,negative,"i took my 2000 ford e-250 van in last week after i rebuilt the engine and transmission.  this isn't the first rebuild that i have done and it won't be the last, but it will be the last time i give virginia auto another dime!  i replaced just about every sensor and i used brand new parts while performing a complete rebuild.  chuck's speed shop did my block work @ $680.00.  between the engine and transmission, i have over $4,500.00 just in new parts, the labor was from myself...and the van does run.  i'm just not happy with the idle once the engine is at temp.

history: my van fired right up after the rebuild, but it began to run rough after warming up with 50 miles on the new rebuild.  the dash cluster temp gauge wasn't reading the temp, or it was inop., so i figured that the computer was unable to read the temp and make fuel mixture corrections . it turns out that the temp sensor on the cylinder head does this job, but virginia auto never mentioned this fact to me. in a weak effort to find what was wrong with my van, they checked the fuel pressure, which they said dropped off shortly after turning the ignition on.  they recommended changing out the fuel pump, fuel filter and swapping out the temp gauge with ford motor craft parts. i had already changed the fuel filter. i asked how much they would charge to install a new motorcraft fuel pump and they told me $900.00 - $1,000.00!!!  i asked how much the fuel pump would cost and i was told $600.00!!!  wtf?! you can purchase the ford fuel pump for $297.00 from rockauto.com!  i chose the carter for $135.00 and they looked identical during the swap.  i used a new motorcraft temp gauge too.  virginia told me that they have never heard of ""carter"".  i'm not sure how much these guys know about anything.

my major complaint comes from having to argue over how much the diagnostics fee and time should run.  they gave me an attitude when i told them $300 - $500 was too expensive and i'd give them 2 hours, then i wanted a call because i wasn't giving them an open checkbook of mine.  their shop rate is $127.00.  the second service writer chimed in and informed me that they would need to retrace my steps on my rebuild because i might have stuff crossed, missing, or incorrectly routed, which pissed me the f@#$ off!  i kept my cool and i told him that i took pictures, made diagrams, and i purchased the ford repair manuals, which are three thick books!  after just over an hour, i walked over and asked about the progress where i was informed about the fuel pump pressure, which they said they found within the first 20 minutes.  the rest of the time was spent doing god only knows what, but they didn't even come close to helping me fix the poor idle at temp or the rough start and they charged me $289.00 without finding a single issue.  note: they had the van for an entire day, but only worked on it between other jobs - this info came from the manager.  i told them what i didn't change out during the rebuild because there was only a couple parts.  i also wanted the timing checked, but they never wrote that down because they were way too busy pressuring me into giving them an open checkbook!  seriously, does anyone do honest work anymore?!

save your time addressing my review with your wit and sarcasm and spend some time and money teaching your guys some ethics!  i may not know everything, but i have honor and integrity."
61,negative,"i wanted to see if they could do a coolant flush...so i brought the car in and told them what was going on.  the guy made a half-assed remark about my key fob and processed the paperwork.

after 15 mins he comes up to me and says ""we can't work on your car"" because my coolant and transmission fluid were mixing.  this is what i told him when i started giving my information.

i called a tow truck and left promptly.  my issue is, if you can't do the work then say so, or better put...if you don't know how to/don't want to be held liable for any issues that could possibly occur afterwards, then shoot straight instead of giving some bs excuse.  maybe that's a reason why that place always is empty when i drive past.

terrible experience.  don't ever come here"
62,negative,"haven't had my car for a year yet and i have had so many problems. bought the car with the ac/ heat fan needing to be replaced. they knew and told me to make an appointment with their mechanic i did, took my car back to get fixed and the mechanic located on first street didn't even know i was showing up or what i needed then proceeded to tell me he had other cars he needed to work on and didn't know where the part was. now my check engine light is on and tcl light said it was my spark plugs git those fixed and my gaskets are going to need to be replaced. my car is drinking gas like crazy, making a loud put put noise, and idling really high. i have no idea what else will need to be fixed. i definitely got a lemon. i also got extended warranty but of course my car didn't start breaking until the coverage expired!  i am a single mom and depended on them to give me a good car. will not recommend this car company to anyone i know. bad customer service, bad cars."
63,negative,"came in for transmission fluid replacement and they told me i needed to change all my brake pads plus the rotors in the rear needed to be replaced. they quoted me 525 just for the brakes. i went to another repair shop and they said all my rotors were fine and even showed me. i think they were trying to play me cause i'm a girl who knows nothing about cars. thankfully, my dad told me to leave and gave me a normal ballpark on the cost of brakes. ladies, if you go into any auto shop, ask someone who's well versed in car maintenance or take an auto repair course cause these men will play you."
64,negative,"i went here for a diagnosis and was told that i needed a complete engine replacement or rebuild and that i would never be able to get my check engine light off. when i took it into an actual mechanic they fixed my truck and got the engine light off (without rebuilding/ replacing my engine). i also found out i was driving on a broken break line, which meineke didn't tell me about. i went back to meineke to get a refund and was told that since i didn't pay for any parts i wouldn't be able to get my money back even though they didn't actually tell me what was wrong with my truck. i definitely got scammed and would not recommend this business to anyone. not even for an oil check because they obviously don't know what they are doing."
65,negative,"when i came in for an oil change and tire rotation the service representative tried upselling me ""scheduled maintenance"" when my 2014 impala had 31k miles.  after reviewing all of the ""scheduled maintenance"" that was hand written (which should have gave me my first clue that i was being ripped off), i decided that all that i could possibly need from the list was a transmission flush.  the scheduled maintenance cost went from about $500 to $200 which i agreed with at the time.  after getting home i looked at my owners manual and in the service schedule part of my manual i saw that i was not to have my transmission oil changed until it reaches 45k miles.  so i felt a bit swindled into paying for maintenance that was not due for another 14k miles.  so there is a possibility that when i go to henderson chevrolet service department i have to make sure that the technicians are bing honest with me before i purchase anymore ""scheduled maintenance""."
66,negative,"was a satisfied customer for 5 or 6 years, but then came a dramatic change in the fall of 2014. the shield beneath the engine of our lexus came loose. they reattached it. when it came loose again, i had them remove it. in so doing, they failed to secure the shields in the front wheel wells. both came loose and were shredded by the tires. they cut out the shredded parts, leaving two gapping holes.  
     but this is about our camry. on 9/25/14, they replaced both front axles and the valve cover gasket. on 10/31/14, they replaced the oil pan gasket assembly. on 12/29/14, the car was leaking some kind of fluid. i figured i'd better get a second opinion, so took the car to johnston's automotive on 24th street. they put the car up on the rack and couldn't believe the ""shoddy"" work that had been done. the left front axle was spewing transmission fluid, the newly installed oil pan gasket was cracked and the pan itself was dented, but at least it didn't leak. a number of bolts were missing. the valve cover bolts were just sitting in place but not tightened. also missing were the exhaust hanger bracket and cotter pins to the tie rod. 
     i took the car back to discount brakes that day and showed them the ""laundry list"" from johnston's. the manager said they would make it right. a week later, they said the car was ready. i took it back to johnston's for a post-mortem. they showed me that two bracket bolts for the wiring harness were still missing and that nothing had been done to the oil pan gasket. they said putting in a cork gasket is the cheap way and that silicone is the proper way. there was nothing in the way of an explanation, nor an apology for the shoddy work done by discount brakes, leading me to believe that this was not an uncommon occurrence. obviously, i won't be back."
67,negative,"i took my car to chris based on the advice of a friend, who hadn't been to his shop in a few years but had used him previously. the first time, i needed break pads replaced, and that repair went just fine, and under what i'd been quoted by big o tires. then, a year or so later, my check engine light came on and i took my car back to him. the first repair he had the car for nearly two weeks to do two or three days worth of work, and charged me $300 more than what he had quoted on the phone! then, 10 miles after picking it up, the car kicked another check engine light. this time, the repair took a full week and then some, when other shops have said it should have taken two days. he said i needed a part replaced which my new shop has since said was not necessary. but, after having my car nearly a month, it sounds worse than it ever did and can barely accelerate over 40 mph! it's a shame, he's a nice guy, but i don't trust him with my vehicle- or my time and money!- anymore."
68,negative,"how  frustrating  service department! 2016 escalade has bad transmission been in on and out for weeks still not working! run around lots of talk, take it back!"
69,negative,awfully place one of the worst experience i had dealing with a company thats taking my money i. got my car repaired there worst choice work was half done broke and glued it bk allowing me to drive home with a glue soaked key it got stuck in my ignition cost another 200 and then didnt fix the body correct i was unable to open gas tank im on e and no help 20 miles away no compensation no empathy no care never will a wish this money costing rude could less group of folks there so dissatisfied never again
70,negative,"i brought my car here last april to have my muffler replaced.  they had a deal going for oil changes, so i had that done, too.  somewhere along the line, i got upsold for a wheel balance that i probably didn't need, to the tune of $48.  it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, and i am reminded of it every time i get one of their stupid postcards informing me that my car may be due for brakes, or whatever else they have going at the time.  i have a friend who replaces my brakes for me, and even if i didn't, i sure as heck wouldn't have them done by monroe muffler!"
71,negative,"this review has taken me 2 years to write. i've never had such an awful experience with a car in my life. i am the not so proud owner of a cadillac escalade, platinum edition that was purchased from henderson chevy. first, my husband and i bought the car on a saturday and that next monday we wanted to return it. the engine started making funny noises and we knew there were going to be problems. henderson chevy told me they do not accept returns and we were stuck with the car. a few months later we were having huge technical issues with the car. it would completely restart on its own (while driving it) and the locks would go crazy. i took it in and they couldn't find anything. $100 (to have it looked at) wasted. the problem persisted, i took it in again (another $100) and it was the transmission. they fixed it. not even a week after i got it back it was having issues again. i took it back and it was the battery connection, which is an easy fix for us. luckily their service department isn't as shady as their sales department. so, a year later, we now are faced with the problem of the lifter being broken. i called to see if there was anything they could do for us since i was just over 9k on my warranty and they said no. this car has been nothing but problems for us. we even tried to go back and trade it in but they tried to tell me i would have to pay the upside down on it. which is not going to happen. they need to make this right bc we bought a luxury vehicle that has been crap. they sold us, what i feel is a lemon and won't do anything about it. the biggest kicker is the fact that we bought the car for 42k (final price) but the dealership listed it with the dmv as an 80k vehicle so we are paying double the registration for it. i will never come back here and i tell everyone i can how shady they are."
72,negative,"took my saturn ion to them in july for transmission problems. they had it a month and said it was fixed after spending over 2000.00 on the parts. they then charged me 650.00 for labor. after a week or two the car started acting up so i took it back. they had the car for a week and after i called them numerous times said it was a celluniod that needed replaced. they told me they would call when it was done. they never called i had to call them. they said it was fixed again. so i picked it up. i didn't even get back home when it did it again. i called them and they said to bring it back. they had it a week again and said they would call when they knew what was wrong they never called i called them. they said it was celluloid and they replaced it. i picked up the car and drove it home. not more than a mile from the place it was doing the same thing. i called them while driving home and they said it was fixed that there was nothing wrong with it. they said if it was broken the check engine light would be on. which it wasn't. i took the car home and it completely died on green valley pkwy. i stopped and turned it off. then i started it again and it would go but only a few feet it died in my apt complex's gate way .i pushed it to my parking spot where it sat till it was reposed because i won't pay for a broken car. basically i would not take my car there for all the money in the world. they are untrustworthy, unreliable, and downright shady. do not take your car there."
73,negative,"stay away from this place. i brought my audi a6 there w/ a list of 4 issues i wanted taken care of...long story short...i'm out $600 and none of the 4 issues were fixed.

1st time i drove my car from their shop after being worked on, there was big puddle of oil in my driveway.  i checked oil level, the dipstick was completely dry. car had to be towed back to the shop.

2nd time after they worked on it, i brought home, oil still dripping and they forgot to put the engine cover back on, so back to the shop it had to go.

the 3rd time, and after a week at the shop, the car still drips oil, coolant leaks, clicking sound from turn signal stays on, and the check engine light still on.

i'll admit the people there are polite and seem willing to help, but simply put, the job doesn't get done. save your money."
74,negative,i took my vehicle in to get a check engine light fixed and dropped my vehicle off in the morning. i didn't receive a call all day and had to go in at 5:30 when they closed to see if my vehicle was finished. they ran a very quick diagnostic on my vehicle and then came back in with a 1600 dollar estimate. after i said i would take my vehicle elsewhere the guy working the front desk somehow took 600 dollars off my bill. honest mechanics will start out with the fair price. not try to work you over for more money. after still saying no the person working the front counter had poor customer service and told me i didn't care. to me honesty in a company is very important. which was not the service that i got at fletcher's auto and tire. but i took my truck down to sunburst automotive who gave me an honest price which was half the cost for parts and cheaper labor.
75,negative,"bought a used jeep from them, the salesman was unprofessional. they offered me an insulting interest rate, so found my own.  the salesman harassed me everyday while i getting the loan approved. finally, i had to contact the finance manager to stop the daily phone calls.  

i had to take the car back 4 times because it could not pass e-check.  after the ""fixes"" the check engine light was still on.  i was told that reason the light was still on was not their issue to fix.

i can not suggest anyone purchase a vehicle from this dealership."
76,negative,"i  just had my oil changed @ happy harry's today. the service tech came advised that i should have my transmission fluid changed because it was black and dirty? well i was busy (it's christmas eve) so i declined the service. upon returning home asked my husband if he could check the tyranny fluid as the guy said i should have it flushed, my husband told me he had just had it done 1 month ago when he had the timing belt replaced; so he went out and checked the fluid to be sure and ""it's nice and pink"", not black and dirty! so were they trying to rip me off, or rip and woman off? my husband called and spoke with a manager but it didn't seem as if they cared. not returning to this car wash anymore, and it's right around the corner from my house. to bad happy harry's we have 3 cars washed monthly!  shouldn't cheat people...."
77,negative,"i only use enterprise because of the outstanding staff and cars. this past rental, the staff was outstanding but the car was horrible. rented a toyota camry and it had several issues. front end was out of alignment, car had noticeable damage to it and a transmission that slipped and almost left us stuck in an intersection. the car had over 37,000 miles and for a rental that is a lot...i will still continue using enterprise, they need to step up their game on their rental cars."
78,negative,"absolutely horrible. worst experience i've ever had buying a car! they sell me a 2005 nissan altima. a month after having it, i find out my brakes are metal to metal.  christmas day, my car won't start. find out its my camshaft sensor. replaced that then my o2 sensor. today (6months owning the car) find out my catalitiyc convertor is going out. guess who won't cover it.... i've invested more in this car then i ever have in any car. they're very rude when you call and pretty much say oh well, its your problem. do not buy from here!!!"
79,negative,"bought our car here. at first it seemed like a good experience but after we got the car home, things took a turn for the worse.
for starters, we noticed a chip in the windshield a few hours after we picked up the car. we called them to tell them and see if they'd fix it, since it was pre-existing. they only referred us to call ""their guy"" that does their repairs. well, we called ""their guy"" and after 3 days of playing phone tag, my husband and i ended up taking it to safelite on our own. 

then, the transmission started being weird. shifting on the car was acting up, and the trans felt like it was slipping when we would put the car in reverse. the rpms would get really low. at this point we had only owned the car for like 3 weeks... and it only had 24k miles on it.
so again, we called zimbrick to see if they could do something. long story short, we had to pay $120 out of our own pockets to get the car ""diagnosed"" at a dodge dealership.and then we were told nothing was really wrong with it, but they noticed the trans fluid was low. zimbrick replaced the trans fluid for free. big friggin deal. 

so then after all this, i take the car for a standard oil change at sears and the guy asks me if i'd like a new air filter. he showed me the old one and it was black as night. why didn't zimbrick do an oil change/inspection before putting the car for sale?

this makes me feel like zimbrick only makes their used cars look cosmetically good enough to sell... and they skip out on the internal aspects. 

i still love my car. but i won't buy from zimbrick next time. that's for sure."
80,negative,"early june i was in colorado when my f350 started to take time to start. ford garage in steamboat said the flywheel was damaged and needed to be replaced.
got home and had berg replace flywheel and starter. cost me 1,500.00
to replace a flywheel the transmission has to be dropped...

three weeks later i noticed fluid under the truck. brought back to berg... mechanic that replaced flywheel said it had nothing to do with what they did. wants to charge me 1,500.00 to fix.
hmmmm.... i let the service rep have it. after i unloaded on him he had the manager look at the problem. manager came back and said they nicked the pan when re-installing the tranny, and they would not charge me to fix leaks. i was heading back to colorado and had to wait to fix leaks till i returned.

three weeks later i finally had time to get truck back to berg to get leak fixed. on sept. 18, 2013 berg called me to come to shop to see what was happening. on arrival i was taken out back to garage with my service rep, manager and mechanic.
they showed me 3 leaks at front, back, and dipstick tube. they informed me leaks had nothing to do with them dropping tranny. oh really...

they said they could fix for up to 4,500.00 or have re-built tranny installed for 4100.00

must really think the general public is stupid... i said nothing and left.
brought truck to randy's transmission service in mesa. he put truck on lift and withing a minute said i had 2 very minor leaks that were definately caused by berg when tranny was dropped originally. i went ahead and had randy fix the leaks for 700.00. 
i will go after berg for the 700.00 in court if i have to.

berg ford cannot be trusted... i've had them do oil changes on my trucks for years. never again will i deal with this dealership. stay as far away from berg ford as possible...  bob   f 350 owner"
81,negative,"the las vegas office doesn't answer the phone.  they do push extras, but somewhat meekly. the transmission fluid plug fell out of my car. i tried to call to ask whether i should do it, or return it. i called the national number, one person said to return it to the airport and another said to have it fixed, which i did. this is not an accidental problem. i know they will fight to pay the bill, so bbb letter is on the way"
82,negative,"i bought my 2012 mustang from this dealership got nothing but the run around from everyone in finance from the get go they told me i was financed no problem two weeks into it i got a rude phone call stating for me to bring the car back that i was not financed, i went back only to find out they sold my trade in got nothing but the run around again for two solid months could not get anybody in finance on the phone to tell me what was going on, 3 months into the deal after speaking with and providing needed infor to the credit union that was financing me myself my car deal was finally complete, two months later my transmission is now out in my car do not recommend this dealership in any way"
83,negative,"i was at 3k since my last oil change and i knew i had driven past this place a few times (i'm new to the area).

so i drive up and dude is  all in my face asking if i want the signature service and he goes on to explain it and i ask how much it is and he says 37.99.  i say i just want an oil change and he says it will still be 37.99.  i then say well i think i'll just go somewhere else that's pretty expensive.  he says how about  $10 off and i agree.

they do their thing.  the guy brings me out to go over everything.  your right lisence plate light is out do you want that fixed?  no.  your wipers are looking pretty bad do you want us to replace those?  no.  we have this fuel cleaning blah blah?  no.  we tested your battery and you need a new batter.  how much is that?  $106.  not at this time.  your air filter looks ok do you want a new one?  no.  do you want premium, high temp oil?  no just regular oil.  we recommend getting your tired rotated ever 2 oild changes do you want that?  no.  we recommend getting transmission fluid flush every 30k miles do you want that?  no..... 

oh then i'm driving on the highway and they didn't close my hood all the way tight so i had to pull off and slam it.

i just wanted a simple oil change and left alone.  i like when i can stay in the car and be out of there in 5 minutes not a sales pitch."
84,negative,"i bought a new 2016 honda accord from here the sale when well i got more coverage then i wanted when asked to have some of the service refunded as it states in the contract i got the run around. called the loan company and the insurance place them self said it has to be done through the dealer. you guessed it run around again. 
 the car from new has had a high pitch whistle when driving. they checked it found a recall said all was fine. took the car found it was still there. then the transmission wouldn't go on along road trip let it cool off came out it worked fine bought it to the dealer can't tell me why there is a noise but know it's from the transmission but they don't know how to fix it and the couldn't get it to slip. ok so i get it i need to drive it more till i really brake the transmission and get stranded some where. 
so next i go out to my car after the service and just happen to notice that the tires were not rotated as they said and the measurements the technician put on my paper for my car were not real. the brakes were not measured correctly either because the tires never came off the car.
saving grace for this place was the service writer who took the time to fix the issue. took longer but he did what was right. sad part is its one of the services i had paid for that i didn't want so i paid and got ripped off.  my time is worth money and doing the service for 4 hrs and still have a high pitch noise. just beware that you are not taken for the same ride."
85,negative,we received an impala...only drove it from rental to hotel and parked it with the valet...on the way to the airport with 3hrs to spare the transmission gave out in the middle of a busy intersection...after waiting for tow truck we barely made it to the airport...advantage did not even try to get us to the airport on time...had to change our flight as we ended up with 30 minutes till our original flight's departure and that was once we boarded the shuttle to las from rental drop off...never using advantage car rental again.
86,negative,"the staff is friendly, for the most part, although some of the staff seemed to be a little condescending. i took my car here because my engine was running rough and i told them to do a complete check up to see what was causing the problem. they called me later and told me i needed two things fixed which would cost $800. i was hesitant because that's a big dent in my budget and it's an older car. i decided to go through with it, got my car back, it lasted the 5 minute ride back home, and the next time i started up my car, it was running rough again. i brought it back and apparently my catalytic converter was burned out among other things that would cost me 1.5k more. if i was told from the beginning that repairs would cost 2.3k, i would not have gone through with the repairs. i don't see how they failed to miss a burned out part. now i spent $800 on a car that's going to the junkyard because the people working on my car did not notice damage to a very significant part of my car (that the check engine light code gives the notification that there's a problem there) or just tried getting some money from me. definitely will never come here again when/if i get a new car."
87,negative,"their show room is like a museum, with lots of exotic and hard to find cars, including bentleys, lambos, classic american muscle cars, and high-end bmws and mercedes.  i had arranged previously to meet a salesman, named jake, in the morning when they opened to check out a nissan 300zx.  when i arrived, jake wasn't there, however another fellow said he would handle me.  while an employee was moving some very nice looking cars out of the way so the nissan could be driven out of the show room, i walked around and looked at a variety of interesting vehicles.  i wandered within ear-shot of a conversation between one of their salesmen and their detailer (possibly mechanic as well) as they discussed the virtues of various paint-types and how much easier old cars' paints are to touch up.  when they saw me, they immediately dropped their conversation somewhat nervously. should have been my first clue.  when i got in the car, i immediately noticed several problems, including problems with the stereo and the power windows, both of which were featured in the car's ad.  ok, its an older car, no problem - until i got it on the road.  the car pulled terribly to the right - ok, an older car, lets see what the mechanic says...
jake had assured me over the phone that the vehicle was in ""excellent condition"".  from my untrained eye, it looked shiny enough.  the mechanic told me otherwise:
major body work done
a hasty repaint to conceal damage that was already beginning to flake and bubble (thought of the hushed conversation i had overheard in the show room)  
oil leaking from every conceivable place
missing screws bolts, battery flopping around
hoses disconnected and leading to no where
transmission leaks
tension bar totally broken - source of the pulling to the right, no easy alignment fix
leaking brake calipers
leaking steering
leaking transmission...the mechanic stopped there and brought me over to show me the problems
the car was checked out at az import specialists by a mechanic who was has been working on nissan 300zx since they came out in 1990.  he gave the car an overall ""poor"" rating and strongly advised against buying the car.
additionally, the car burned gas like a tank on fire, and there is no way it would pass smog.

i drove 1000 miles round trip to check out a car the salesman (jake) had assured me was in ""excellent condition"", and within twenty minutes the mechanic came back with a ""poor"" rating.

be ware the spit-shine job jba does on their cars. they are all shiny, and i'm guessing look clean if you pop the hood, but please take the car to a mechanic before you buy.
az import specialists saved me a huge headache and lots of money, and the 96 bucks i spent was well worth it. 
jba's salespeople are either ignorant of their cars, or dishonest in their representation as they shine them up and hope somebody will buy without checking out the mechanics.
be advised."
88,negative,"how  frustrating  service department! 201escalade has bad transmission been in on and off for weeks still not working! run around lots of talk, take it back!

sadly it's not going better!"
89,negative,"really wasn't at all happy about the appointment.  i had a coupon for the preferred oil change which was supposed to include oil filter, inspection, tire pressure check, rotate tires, top off fluids, balance check all tires and 4 months free road side assistance.  they got started about 30 minutes after scheduled appointment, ok, i get it, no problem.  before the car was raised they had taken out the cabin air filter, took 2 minutes maybe.  they later came in and showed my the filter was dirty and they would replace it for $94.  the filter is about $15 and i know that it took a couple of minutes to install.  heck they had to put my old one back in so they were going to charge me $70+ for a couple of minutes work.  i saw the oil change and the topping off of the fluids but they backed it out of the garage without doing anything with the tires.  i told them that my tires weren't rotated and he told me that they didn't need to be.  ???  um, how was that determined?  oh, we inspected the tires.  i know that it was time for them to be rotated, it gets taken care of regularly. i get an alert from the place i bought them and i had gotten the email but i was pressed for time and needed oil and tire rotation before a weekend trip so i thought i would kill two birds so to speak.  so pretty sure the tires were not rotated correctly when they pulled my car back in and i am positive they did not get the balance check.  my fault, plan ahead and take it the dealer for oil and my tire place for the rotation, it will get done right.  oh, never got any info on the road side either. seeing some of the other comments it seems if you are a women you will get good service."
90,negative,i'm very disappointed with this dealership. i was trying to make an appointment for transmission oil change and i was on hold like 10 minutes. then woman said that she gonna redirect me to service center then another 10 minutes on hold and suddenly the connection was lost.
91,negative,"i really hoped that things with big 4 will improve over time, but they didn't. now, warranty period over, i think it's time to check the balance.

salesman was amazing - friendly, funny, giving good advice. truly a reason to prefer big 4 over the competition. pity he deflated quickly after the troubles began.

unfortunately, the sale itself was not as smooth - got my car delivered with a dent on the hood. had to drive away immediately, but got a senior manager reassuring that it will be fixed, no worries.

it wasn't. our salesman went dull and said there is a process to follow, time to wait, etc. at the end, the dent remained. 

further on i've discovered that sales feature list was mismatching actual vehicle features (e.g.: fuel capacity promised 120, actual 90). tried twice to get the revised list printed, did not happen - ""printer off-line"", ""can't print landscape, list truncated"", etc.

service was oriented towards being as frequent and expensive as possible, with messy structure of ""service contracts"". yet missing obvious problems - got one pinched tire rotated twice before they finally recognized the problem and fixed it.

was charged for a key fob battery though still on warranty - some funky procedural hiccup, but money back never happened. got charged extra $$$ for flushing the windshield fluid ""your windshield cracked because of that!"" (really? i thought that was because of lose gravel flying everywhere...)

once mechanic forgot to fully insert the oil stick, left it dangling under the hood, mud getting into the tube. another time got oil change indicator not reset, and then have it off again way before next change was due. was told my driving made the just replaced oil in a new engine burn in just 3000 km. etc., etc., etc. 

in short, lots if bs and extra money wasted. though customer service reps were usually very nice, and shuttle service super helpful. 

i even was on the phone with chrysler folks, and they were awesome too - but no help with my troubles. 

so overall, never again. neither chrysler, nor big 4. thanks. 

in my mind, compared them to renault i use to deal with for years - my gosh, no comparison! europeans were impossibly better in any aspect."
92,negative,"worst canadian tire ""pit stop"" experience! people that work here are too relax and work too slow! went for an oil change and an old man ""zaymar"" was helping me. i could barely understand the word he was saying. he said to me that there are two cara ahead of me and would take 45 mins atleast, i said ok. and he stared at me. hey buddy im getting my oil change today. the two other cars that were supposed to be infront of me were not even infront of me after all! cuz one of them came in and was asking for an oil change too, the other one was asking for help to fill her transmission fluid... what an idiot. anyway i waited for 45 mins in the store. came back my cars not done yet apparently they were waiting for me for other bs... annoying get my oil change i wanna gtfo... anyway i had to wait for another 20 mins for it to finish. terrible service. you could see staff just going for smoke break and eating ice cream. wont be coming back here!! awful!"
93,negative,"on 3/20/2015 i had charleston begin to rebuild my car's engine completely. on 4/20/2015 the job was complete and returned my car to me. after the engine work was completed i attempted to drive home and noticed that my; dashboard instruments/headlights/car alarm/ didn't work and returned immediately to the shop. i was told that they don't know if those instruments ever worked-i'm restoring the car, (1990 eagle talon). that's a lie because before i chose that particular shop i took the vehicle there for future reference. i showed them all the electrical works, as they admired the classic car. after the engine was put back together it took approximately 6 days to get the car started (the cam shaft sensor wasn't connected). they had me bring my alarm operating device to them to see if that was the problem. the alarm was disconnected and not reconnected-said it was reconnected and didn't know if it ever worked. the alarm working was why they had me bring the device to turn it off! got home and the next day noticed a puddle of oil and transmission fluid under the car, so i took it back to them and was told that a cam shaft seal was put back on that is defective and would have to charge me to fix it. i was told to just keep oil in the car until i could get it repaired properly, estimated cost $2,000. about 5 days later checking under the hood of the car i noticed that my air conditioning unit was missing. i called them and yes they had it at the shop. they reinstalled it without the belt so no cool air and it's may in las vegas, nevada! i was told it didn't work is why they kept it! i asked them how they would know when the car was delivered to them on a tow truck. i should have been asked. now i have to get the car's engine rebuilt to have the problem fixed by another mechanic as i don't trust charleston auto repair anymore. i have to now either keep the car parked after paying $1,320 to be able to drive. in good faith, i gave them $900.00 up front and this is what i got. i need my car fixed!"
94,negative,"had my transmission go out on my truck back in dec. 2012.

 called multiple place shopping around, this cottman had a reasonable price had my truck towed down, took them 5 days to have it fixed and i had to call to see when it was done they didn't even call me to let me know it was done.

anyway their fix came with a year warranty as well, once i picked my truck up they told me you should be running fine but call us in a week so we can get you back in to check everything's good and we got some add on for you.

 called a week later the add on part weren't in so they said call back in a few days so i did still no parts, this whole calling back thing turned into two months later with them still not having parts, so i gave up and they never called me back.

so it's now end of june 2013 and i get a radiator leak bring it to a shop closer to home they diagnose and tell me that the new transmission cooler rubbed a hole in your radiator.

 so with my year warranty i had my truck towed back to cottman so they could fix their mistake, they did replace my radiator but as soon as they called for my truck to be picked up they said ""your good to go but your ac isn't blowing very cold"", i said ""yeah i know it's not ideal but it's cool enough can't afford to get it fixed perfectly right now"".

so go down pick up my truck drive away and my ac never starts to blow cold and before i brought it in it was working just fine but yes not ideal like i said, i was pissed and didn't even want to go back a deal with their sh*t. (mind you this is a day before we have 3 days in a row of supposed record high heat around 120 degrees)

so the next day i bring my truck to a shop closer to home again to get my ac filled, turns out there's a leak in a hose for the ac no where near where they would have had to work to change the radiator. the shop by my house tells me.

 they begin to tell me it was probably deliberate since they had to replace my radiator under warranty and wanted some kind of money out of me so they tampered with my ac. and for cottman to call me to pick up my truck from the radiator fix and to immediately tell me my ac isn't blowing very cold when it was working fine before makes me want to believe the new shop telling me that cottman deliberately messed with my ac is indeed true."
95,negative,"i brought in my sons 2004 audi in for a dreaded check engine light.  i have brought this car in before for a simple oil change a few months ago and that that time they stated they are certified to work on audis.  so when the car didn't pass smog, we brought it in.  also, my son was impressed with the arcade, but let me assure you...having an arcade should not replace having qualified mechanics to properly diagnose and fix your car.  so, the code that comes up is an oxygen sensor...joe informs me that it will cost 700, the part itself is 200 but because it is an audi, it will take 5 hours of labor.  then states, ""if it was a ford or a toyota it would only be about 2 hours of labor"". ???? that statement just shouldn't be made, even if it is true.  anyways, he talked me into getting both sensors changed to avoid another 5 hours of labor ""just in case it's not just one sensor"" .  i should've just took it somewhere else right then since he didn't sound too sure about anything.  but i didn't .  i leave it and they don't contact me until the following day.  he then informs my son that when they were getting to the sensors, there was a vacuum hose that broke and it would cost 250 for a new one.  i called him back very upset because it was unfair that we were being charged for a hose they broke.  he stated that it was brittle.  after some back and forth, he wouldn't budge on the hose.  but offered to charge half of their cost of the part which was 95.  i agreed.  but the fact that he was originally going to charge 250 was ridiculous .  so, i left the car on a thursday. then friday he calls about the hose and says they won't get it until tuesday.  then tuesday comes and he calls at 4pm to say he just got the part so it won't be done until wednesday .  in the end it was done and picked up on thursday but he says it still hasn't cleared the sensors and would need to be driven over the weekend and to bring it back on monday to test and make sure it cleared and will pass smog.  i bring it on monday.  luckily it tests ok.  i should have left right then.  but i reminded him that i asked to check the passenger side brake light as it was out.  so joe opens the brake light area out in front parking lot.  he puts in a light bulb checks it but still isn't working.  he puts about 2 more different bulbs and still isn't working.  he tells me he has to order more bulbs and about 15-20 min later he has more bulbs.  he opens up the driver side brake light ( which was working) takes out the bulb and puts another bulb.  then neither brake lights work.  he finally calls another mechanic from the back to look at it.  that guys says to him that he might have put the ring bulbs in and shorted it out.  the mechanic says he's gonna take it in the back to diagnose.  a little while later joe comes out and is on the phone asking for quotes on a brake sensor.  then goes to the back, then comes back and makes another call for a quote for a different part.  then tells me ""this is gonna cost a lot"". then says its some electrical sensor part that will cost $700. and now neither brake light works!!!!!  whaaaaaaaatttt!?!?!?!  i just asked to have one brake light looked at and i leave with neither light working.  so all my son has now is the brake light in the middle of the window.  so unsafe.  but i no longer trust these guys to touch my cars.  this whole experience has been awful.  i don't know if it's because i am a woman.  my boyfriend went to go talk to joe about the brake lights and joe tells him that the light bulbs that were in it were the wrong bulbs and he just put the right ones in.  what a joke .  take my advice and take your car somewhere else.  don't let the rebel logo and arcade fool you.  and don't let joe anywhere near your car!!!!"
96,negative,took my truck to sams for a simple water leak and have them check out my transmission. got it back with the same water leak and a blown moter wound up costing me 3000.00 to fix.sams would not take responsibility for any of the damage. the damage that was done was a result of over reving the engine and spun a main bearing.would not trust them with a go cart.
97,negative,"jesse is completely rude! doesn't seem to care what you have to say & definitely doesn't seem like he's listening to you. 

i called in before i came and made sure that he had everything that was needed and he confirmed. i got here, filled out the paperwork and he said, let me make sure i have the part(transmission filter), he came back and said he has it(second confirmation). he told me it'd take two hours to do the work, my fiancé and i walked and waited for two hours, came back and he said they didn't have the part and ordered it and they're just waiting for it to come in!!! so, what part did you confirm you had twice!? ugh!! i asked him how long it would take to come in and he said, ""anytime"", my watch doesn't have an ""anytime"" option! so we sat and waited in the small room, where the sound of him answering his phone so loudly and the other guy behind the desk clearing his throat sounding completely disgusting! after 30mins of waiting, i went out to ask if there was an eta and he said that they have the part. i asked how much longer, he said he didn't know so i told him i had to be across town in 45mins and he finally went to tell the guys to get it down. had i not mentioned i had to be somewhere, was he just gonna wait til they got to it? this is ridiculous! 

yes, he gets the job done. just not when he promised and then if you question him, not only is he rude, but he's vague! customer service is just not available in most places these days."
98,negative,"i bought my 2010 malibu ltz 9/16/14. the only good part about my experience was the salesman. he was very nice and professional. once i got into finance it went down hill. the finance guy was more concerned with his watch that could start his car, selling me a tire warranty, and that floyd mayweather was trading in his cadillac suv's for suburbans. the one thing i really wanted was gap insurance, i was told to just get it from my insurance company. i figured he knew what he was talking about so i signed the contract and left in my car. the next day the finance guy calls me and says the bank rep was at the dealership and he got me a better deal and i needed to get down there fast. i said ok i was on my way. as soon as i walked out the door he called me back and said never mind and he will call me back.  i ended up going in later that day to resign my contract. then about 2 weeks later i found out my insurance doesn't do gap and i should of got it from the dealership, by this time i was so irritated and pissed off i could do nothing but cry. i called my sales guy and he was able to get the manager of the finance dept to finish my deal and take the stuff i didn't want off and get me my gap insurance. 

now the service dept.  i told the used car service guy that my car drove rough. he told me that it was most likely from the car being parked in the lot and after about driving 100 miles things will even out. i said ok. then about 2-3 weeks after i signed my contract my locks started locking and unlocking on their own while i was driving. i called the used car service guy because my 30 day/ 1,000 mile warranty wasn't expired. he told me there was nothing he could do and i had to go through the regular service for it. i then called regular service and was told to just bring my car in. i left work and took my car in. i was then told they couldn't look at my car and i would have to leave it. i said i couldn't be with out a car. i then made an appt for my day off. when i got back to work the girl who schedules appts called me. i told her i already made an appt and her response was well who made that because we don't have appts available. you'll just have to leave your car till we can look at it. she had the worst attitude!!!!!! now by this time i had enough and was not very nice. she ended up putting me on hold then told me she had to call me back. one of the service guys called me back and told me to bring my car back and they would get me a rental that i had to pay for a discounted fee but i still paid. i took the car in and explained everything that was wrong. i told him my car has a very rough idle and drives rough. they kept my car for 2 days. of course they couldn't find anything wrong. made me feel like i was crazy. 

fast forward to 1/4/15.......... i'm driving home from california with my 3 children and dog. my car looses power and won't accelerate. this happens twice. thankfully she got us all home safe. i took my car to another chevy dealership in town on 1/7/15 this was their first available appt. the service consultant turned my car on and say ""wow your car idles rough"". i think to myself i knew i wasn't crazy!!!! i was given a car to drive while my car was being looked at. i get a call today that my transmission fluid is over heating because it's old and nasty. my car only has 46k miles on her. i now have to pay for work that should of been fixed months ago. 

to add insult to injury i bought my previous car from henderson chevrolet and had no problems. this time was horrible!!! i wouldn't even send someone i didn't like there! i will never return to this place!!!!!!!!"
99,negative,"too bad i can't put a negative star for this crappy place.  i hate to be the one to write negatively but this place really sucks.  unless you like proselytizing with your car repair.  

ok, so my truck was having a few seperate problems..one was the a/c and it was like 115 degrees, and the other turned out to be the radiator.

sooo i get a friend to put freon in the a/c and that's that..i take it to this place to have a diagnostic test run on it so they can determine that the radiator is busted..well i am new around here and they offer me a ride home while they work on the problem..i am thinking gosh these guys are so nice, wow! guess what? next thing i know i am trapped in a car with some old guy asking me which passages of the bible i have memorized..wtf?? i tell the guy i am not a christian..now he's thinking -challenge!! well next thing i know i am getting out of the car with some religious pamphlets and feeling like i need to take a shower.  it was just creepy..i am sorry maybe there are some people out there who like to be told how and why they're belief system needs to change when they go to get their car repaired.
well finally i get a call from them saying ""yep it's the radiator, we can't repair it so we'll have to get you a new one"" i say ok what's that gonna run me..they say ""$319.00"" i hit the ceiling, said no let me call around and see if i can find something else..i just replaced the radiator in my old car for $60.00..i have no luck! sadly and reluctantly i call back and say ok do the work.  jesus freak picks me up and goes out of his way to drive by his church on the way to the mechanic shop!! i am like totally pissed feel like i am getting robbed and now this guy thinks he's doing me a favor by talking about his religion which i am constantly changing the subject away from but he ignores me and continues to beat me over the head with....anyways we get to the shop, the guy goes ""ok that'll be $394.00!"" i lost my mind..i got mad argued and explained i didn't bring that much money with me and now he was going to cut into my survival budget in a way that i wouldn't recover from.
i am so mad looking at this guy with a jesus portrait behind him as he takes me to the cleaners.  
i give him all the money i have and he gives me the keys..he's stapling something to the receipt just before i snatch it off the counter and storm out..i look at the paper he stapled to it, and it's guess what?? bible verses!! oh thanks, is this the one about how the mechanic can lie about the price over the phone and rip you off for another hundred bucks? i tore it off and threw it out the window onto their parking lot- i know it was really mature of me but i couldn't help myself.

do not go here unless you love jesus and want to pay extra!"
100,negative,"went here to take a look at a vw eos.  the first guy i ran into, barry, offered to bring the only one they had on the lot to the front of the store to show me how the convertible top worked.  he finally located it and gave my friend and i a demonstration.  pretty cool.  i was considering giving my information to him so he could call me when they got more in or help me locate one, until while telling me about how great the manual transmissions are in volkswagons he offended both my friend and i by explaining that there were two guys that worked there that didn't know how to drive stick.  i said, ""well, if vw makes such an easy stick shift then why don't you teach the two guys that don't know how to drive one?""  and he responded with a dismissive eye roll.  ""well they are both black guys.""  wtf does that even mean? 

i realize that blatant racism was something i was going to have to battle with by relocating south of the mason dixon line, but c'mon.  i will find somewhere else to take my business."
101,negative,"went in to replace radiator for my corvette.  the mechanic was totaly incompetant. mechanic had to disconnect transmission cooler lines, but could not figure out how to refill transmission fluid, or check it. mechanic said it is ok to lose transmission fluid. (about a quart was spilled on floor.)mechanic installed wrong coolant. i insisted they install dexcool, as per mfr's strict guidelines.  after getting car home, i inspected for leaks, and found that several coolant hose clamps were not tightened at all, airflow baffles were not re-installed but were in the front bumper, fan shroud retaining parts were not installed, air cleaner not installed right, and a 103 dollar plastic air filter retaining clamp was broken in half. 
   i also discovered that transmission cooler lines were now leaking at the radiator connection. (not installed correctly.) when mechanic installed the correct coolant, he mixed it himself with 50% tap water. now i need to flush the sytem myself, and install a premixed 50/50 dexcool mixture of coolant, or risk engine damage. 
 the managers are friendly and seem to care, but the mechanics are total morons and a$$ clowns. i complained to customer service, and a diistrict manager ordered the manager to refund the total repair, and buy me a new plastic air filter clamp. i still had to take my car to another shop to repair the transmission cooler connectors, and properly check the transmission fluid. (complicated procedure on corvette involving car on lift, engine running, and removing drain plug, and injecting fluid with hand pump.) i would not trust firestone mechanics to work on my lawnmower, let alone my corvette. take my advice, and stay away from these idiots, if you want youre car fixed right. sure the managers are friendly, but the mechanics are worthless. 
  this shop has only recently opened. makes me wonder how these guys lost their last jobs, before they came to firestone. i wonder how many customer cars they screwed up at last job to get fired, then go to firestone."
102,negative,"my parents took our honda pilot in to get a check engine light repaired. they did diagnostics and ""fixed"" the issue. we drove at least 50 miles to see if it came back on (they told us to). what do you know, it came back on. we went back in and we're quoted another $220. my dad went in a few weeks later and the owner said he fired all the people that my parents had spoken with. he quoted us $1,000 unlike one of the guys that got fired. not impressed at all."
103,negative,"boo, boo and double boo to berge ford!  completely messed up a transmission problem on my ford f-150 costing me well over $1,000, fought me every step of the way, and never really even fixed the problem.  i've been driving the truck just waiting for their bogus repair to fail and have to have my transmission rebuilt.  then i bring it to a corner car repair store by my house who diagnosed a faulty sensor - a $78 part - and now my truck runs like new again.  i'm starting to think now that part was the problem all along and all the mess berge supposedly fixed was all caused by them in the first place.  and this after bringing my truck to them exclusively for maintenance since i bought it in 2004.  i was so stupid to think being a loyal customer would keep my truck in like-new condition.  i should have seen the warning signs of apathy and arrogance all along.  one thing is for sure, they'll never see me or my truck again.  but of course they probably don't care because they gouged me so bad on my transmission they've probably been laughing at me ever since.  what a nightmare!"
104,negative,"so my daughter bought a 2015 ford fiesta about 6 months ago from peoria ford. the car has had transmission issues since it was bought it slips,hesitates, and rpm's go to 5000 rpms between 2nd and third gear. so three times into service the car still has the same issue. ford knows there are issues with the transmission and will do nothing to fix it as they say it is in specs. the car is unsafe and peoria ford just says it not us it's ford. service also goes into that it needs this and this when it needed that when it was bought. they know how to sell something but won't fix the transmission that is under warranty. the car only has 33,000 miles on it. i will never ever buy a ford or do business with peoria ford. it is horrible customer service. they tell me they are not ford but i see ford on their sign. lawsuits galore  on these transmissions and they do nothing. really?"
105,negative,"service engine light went on. took it here since it was on the way home. $65 just have it looked. are you kidding me? it's not the check engine light. i look around the shop, and there's 2 open car bays. they are not busy. i can understand if they were swamped, and they'd have to bring my car up to the bays and get it looked at. but c'mon ino....65 bucks just to plug in that diagnostic machine, to tell me what code comes up. 

no thank you. i've had my fair share of honest mechanics, and this was not an honest move. i drove my car outta there, the same way i drove it in. guess i'll be scouting for another mechanic."
106,negative,"i had to take my car in to figure out why the check engine light was on.  after the 6+ hours it took for them to scan the computer on my car, they called and told me that there was a glow plug that was going out, and it would cost $400 to replace.  i told them not to worry about it at the time, and was charged $130 for them to basically scan my car.  it's my fault that i agreed to it, when i could have taken it elsewhere to have it scanned for free.

that's exactly what i did.  i went to exklusive motorsports (http://www.exklusivmotorsports.com), and they scanned my car for free, and replaced the glow plug.  the owner, derek, only charged me $100, and the cost of the part was $95.  now that's professional.  i also called the stealership to see how much the part would cost from them, and they quoted me something along the lines of $148.  

do yourself a favor and find someone local.  not all repair shops are out to rip you off.  give derek a call if you need some help with your vw and not the dealer!"
107,negative,"i was visiting from out of town this past weekend. after we stopped to get gas, i turned my car back on and my check engine light came on and a strange ticking noise began. i looked up the times of the service department and to find the closest dealership to take my car to. i woke up early and got to the dealership by 8am that saturday. i have never had such terrible service. first i was told they would not guarantee they would even see my car because i didn't have an appointment even after i told the service consultant john ackerman what had happened. he himself was extremely rude. he acted as if i was a burden and he didn't have time to help me. after sitting there for 2 hours i went to the counter to ask if i was going to be able to have my car serviced because i was visiting my family from out of town. he once again stated he already told me he couldn't guarantee i'd be seen because i didn't have an appointment. so i got a lyft driver to pick me up to take me to my family's house. he called me about 30 minutes later and told me that i need a new engine. that i didn't keep up with my maintenance on my car and it was going to cost me $7700 to fix it. i'm in my late 20's. i don't know who has that kind of money to fix it. so i told him i would take my chances and drive it home. after taking it to my normal service mechanic i was told i did not need a new engine. i just needed my 90,000 maintenance and my drive belt and spark plugs would need to be replaced at 100,000 so he recommended to change them out before then. not only was i treated poorly i was lied to. i will tell everyone i know to not service their cars at this dealership."
108,negative,"had a terrible experience at this muffler shop. first of all i am a 30 year old filipino male with a 2013 camaro zl1. wanting to get my exhaust installed bc i am too lazy and it is too hot to install myself so i go to this shop. 

i walk in and the worker doesn't acknowledge me. he was sitting down with his feet up on the desktop and doesn't say anything to me until i say something to him first. i tell him i have this exhaust i want to get installed onto my car. he then stands up and asks me what type of honda or acura do i own. i then tell him i own a 2013 camaro. 

i felt like he was racially profiling me because he said ""what type of honda or acura?"" i know i'm asian and everything but just because i am asian doesn't mean i drive a honda or acura. there's nothing wrong with those cars but i felt a lil racism with the worker. 

customer service was terrible. he sat there in the back room with his feet up not wanting to approach a customer who wanted service at that exact moment. and the racist comment about what type of car i drove because of my race, i thought was unacceptable.  

will never step foot back in that establishment. now i know why this muffler shop has 1 review on yelp and an empty garage to boot. 

i really hope this review stops people from going to this establishment due to incompetent workers with bad work ethics."
109,negative,"i bought a lemon unfortunately. the costumer service was great, but in retrospect i overpaid for a car with 2 accidents on car fax and 5 months later the transmission started to slip, the car had less than 90,000 miles. the shitty part is that once you buy that's it, your on your own. i'm not bashing the character or integrity of trend auto or it's employees, they were kind and i'm sure in due diligence are not in the business of fucking people over, it just sucks that in my case i lost a few thousand."
110,negative,"i brought my car in about a month ago on a monday morning for a simple oil change. they told me they could not get to it for 5-6 hours due to being understaffed. there was only 2 people working at the time. so instead i went to the local terribles and paid $10 more but was out in 20 minutes with a free car wash, so it was pretty much the same. while i was checking out for my oil change the lady at terribles mentioned that i needed a new fuel filter but she was out of stock and could have it the next day. the price would be $39.99 installed. i asked if i could do it the following oil change and she said yes, so i waited. the other day my check engine light went on and when i had it checked i was informed the problem was my fuel filter. i called firestone as it is literally 3 blocks from my house and was told by brian it would be $120. $15 for the filter and 94 for labor plus tax. when i asked why it was 3 times as much as terrible he could not give me an answer. conveniently the manager henry was not around and he did not have the phone number for andy the area manager. i have been coming to this store since the day they opened and have other issues with them. they have changed managers and staff numerous times over the last 2 years and each time it seems to get worse. i have kept coming back due to convenience but if they can't get a simple thing such as not charging 3 times the price for what should be a 15 minute filter change, then i think it is time to move on."
111,negative,"warning!!! please read before having this business service your vehicle!

my 65 yr old mom asked me to find her a reliable,  and trustworthy mechanic.  so thru a little research i found specialized auto care.  their reviews here on yelp, and google were both 5 stars.  so we decided this is where we will have my moms 06 pt cruiser serviced. it was running rough, and the check engine light was flashing.  so we dropped it off with the request of whatever it is, fix it please.   

(this shop is ran only by 2 men.  we were advised upfront that repairs, and or diagnostics can be slightly delayed compared to other shops with more employees.  that's totally fine with me, as long they are honest, and do excellent work.)


after i think a day, and a half after dropping it off, we were called with the prognosis....

 they initially claimed it needed a ""valve job"".  long story short,  the motor had to be taken apart, and certain parts would be sent to a ""machine shop"" as they dont do that in house.  anyway they said the repairs will be approximately $2,500.00, and will be completed in a weeks time.  we said fine let's get it done.

  after 8 days we got the car back.  and upon driving it home ,  it had the same fucking symptoms still!!!!!   its still running rough and the check engine light has come back on!  we just paid this place two thousand five hundred dollars!!!  are you kidding me!!!  

this review is not finished yet, as we are still trying to get this mechanic to fix what is wrong with the car without any additional charges.   we went back today, and were told that the owner/mechanic is out with the flu.  to be continued......

and also, during the time my moms car was in this shop being serviced,  my sister had a problem with squealing brakes in her chevy suburban.  she brought it to them, and they quoted her $400.00 to fix the problem. 

 luckily she decided to get a 2nd opinion.   she went to brake masters,  and low and behold, they fixed it for free!!  can you believe that!  brake masters told her that there were some little clips that her husband forgot to install in the pads when he recently changed them at home.  once again it was free of charge.  whereas specialized auto quoted a whopping $400.00!!!

this mechanic is not honest!  they scammed my elderly parents out of $2500.00 !!

and now they are refusing to fix whatever is still wrong with the car without us paying more money!

the moral of this story is please please get a second opinion!  hell get a 3rd opinion!

do not make the mistake we did, and go solely off the good reviews you see online!"
112,negative,"this was going to be a 4-5 star, seriously. i was logging on to make my payment and was thinking ""i ought to give these guys a good review"". i've been pretty satisfied with a vehicle i purchased there. pretty reliable, free oil changes were prompt. ok i had a flat, but that can happen to a new car. 

anyway, they were upfront when i bought it, yes the price was at the high end (maybe more) but due to a divorce my credit was horrible and i needed a reliable car to get work and rebuild my credit. they are a good match for that situation (low down) if you have a job and can make payments. they also have a social media discount now.

so what's the problem? well after several months of on-time online payments i find they sold the note on my vehicle to another company. unfortunately, this company's payment processing is straight out of the 1990's. if you make an online payment with them they charge you six dollars!!!  huh?!?...$6?!?

do the math ---if you have say 70 payments left on your note, that just added $420.00 to the cost of your car! their answer? ""mail us a check and there is no charge."" a check? are you kidding? this is 2015 do most people even use checks anymore? do they trust the post office?  ...well, i could do an online check...nope, six dollars for that too!

the worst part: in addition to this, all vehicles have an ignition interlock which cuts off the ignition if there is a late payment (or any payment issue).------ listen guys, i bought from you because i need reliable transportation, not a crap shoot every time a payment (or processing error) is made.--------- so much for ""we carry our own contracts"".

if you think i'm over-reacting, i know 3 people that bought here and the 'cut-off' already happened to one of them, even though they already had a payment confirmation number. i sure don't need this when i'm running late for work, or worse, on a vacation. ;) 

anyway, i used to hand out their business cards, now i tell people to think twice. the sale of my note completely changed my mind. - i'm nervous every payday now. it's either mail something and verify and re-verify to be sure it was processed and received and my car will still start...or pay $6 for an electronic transaction that costs them pennies. it's both the cost and the principle i object to.---this sucks..

**addendum** you are now down to 1 star, eas, as the worst has happened.. i paid my 6 bucks and made my second online payment to your new finance company on my payday yesterday (not due until today). and guess what...it wasn't credited. 

i have the confirmation number, i can see the deduction from my bank account and still the interlock is buzzing like mad (the final warning that the vehicle will not start the next time unless your payment is credited).

so just call them, right? wrong, finance company is only open m-f. so here i sit on a saturday night, never missed a payment and i have a 3500 lb boat anchor in the driveway until monday morning. i even had to arrange a ride to work. --- this sucks even worse. ---don't do it if you need reliable transportation!!!
----
update, i made the current payment online. but just spent 30 minutes trying to reach them on the phone to 'send the signal"" to give me permission to drive my car two more weeks. --it disconnected 6 times after 5 minute recordings with an error ""twt9"" whatever that is. you can pay online, but they still need to send the damn signal (phone call) or the car won't start!!!
c'mon guys i need to go to work tomorrow to make money to do this all over again in 2 weeks!!! 
once paid, never again!!!"
113,negative,"stopped here because my check engine light came on and i heard a radio commercial that they can do a quick diagnostic. i waited a very long time to get help. there was only one guy helping customers. another employee walked through and apologized that he couldn't help because he had to take care of a delivery. we were told the manager was on the phone and couldn't help customers either. i was one of 3 people in there with the same ""check engine"" issue. i guess their ads are working, but they are ill prepared to handle the customers. i left irritated and grumpy."
114,negative,sigh these guys let me tell you.... i travel for a living i need a transmission for my h2 i got a quote in texas for roughly $3500 they wanted $5500 i was like what in the world and told them in texas same one same warranty from gm exact same thing was 2k less and they said that's what the transmission alone cost. well... i took the truck to california and guess what $3500 all in and done. buyer beware with these guys.......
115,negative,my girlfriend brought her truck in because the truck shakes under breaking  is under warranty  and instead of replacing the rotors they turned them and told her she needs to downshift her automatic transmission to stop the truck cause the rotors were warped.  so instead of fixing and replacing the warranty item you take the lazy cheap way out and  refinish them  you guys are a joke  i have  a 93 ford and have never had to replace the rotors because they were warped.    i guess it's not easy being number one  and it's hard to have good quality...
116,negative,"well, today's phone call from corporate turned out exactly as i had thought.  they claimed that they contacted the service department and that all the parts that were replaced were all faulty and needed to be replaced.  really, then why is my check engine light still on.  ashley, from corporate was very matter of fact and said that she suggests that i pay the additional 500.00 to have the next part replaced because that is a discounted price.  the problem is, there is no guarantee that it will work or that they won't want to replace something else   it's really a joke.  i don't even know why they looked into anything if they were just going to spew verbatim everything that the service department previously said to me. as a consumer you do not have a leg to stand on when you are being ripped off by outrageous pricing and diagnostics.  you have no choice but to pay before driving your car off the lot.  in my case i drove it off the lot 5 times in two weeks and had to return with the same problem.  shame on you hyundai, you had a chance to do the right thing and prove that all these other reviews were not accurate.  you failed.  i am so very glad that we decided to not purchase that hyundai we were looking at while waiting for our repairs.  instead we purchased a kia and i could not be happier.  consumers, beware.."
117,negative,"by far the worst experience i have ever had.  please believe yelp reviews unlike me. this is the first review i have ever wrote in my life. usually i let things go but this needs to be put out there for future customers. long story short. purchased a 2010 ford explorer limited february 2017 after one month of having the  vehicle march 2017 it left my daughter my grandmother and i on the side road due to the fuel pump going out thus  costing us $1,300 in repairs.now come september we came to get the check engine light fixed and fuel inlet  checked. when the service  gentleman by the name of aj brought the vehicle back  to us we had noticed there was a huge crack on the front of the windshield he then proceeded to circle an area with his pen showing us something had been dropped on the front of the windshield then asked if we'd like to speak to a manager to see what the next steps where.  after speaking with the manager bobby brown he proceeded to tell us it was best that we traded the vehicle in due to how many repairs the vehicle needed $3100 in total. then told us we would at least have to have $2,000 down plus trad in if we were looking to do so .  this not being possible for us.he proceeded to tell us to make an appointment to get the windshield fixed at their cost.mind you we live in east mesa 1hr trip one way. bobby brown gave me the number to have a gentleman in-service named keith  to get an appointment set up. i tried contacting  keith and bobby brown  for the next four weeks calling multiple times with not even a single returned phone call. after many attempts  trying to speak to someone about the issue  and hearing nothing, i told them my next step would be to contact corporate or news  channel 3. i was then transferred to bobby brown who proceeded to tell us that  there wasn't anything he could do because it was not at their fault. after explaining to him  that the gentleman aj in the service department had shown us that something was dropped on the windshield during service. bobby brown told us he needed to deal with a customer and would talk to aj and get back to us this being over a week now! do not do any service here!!!!"
118,negative,"i've come here twice. both times the vet tried to up-sell lots of tests and prescription pills. 

the first time i thought they really were recommending what is for the best- and i actually did get the xrays that they advised, though i had them done at a different vet's office, because it was significantly less expensive. (those xrays didn't explain any of the problems either). the 2nd time, when i brought a stray dog in that looked significantly underweight. the vet said  she could feel the dogs liver... and as she began to explain the next part she hid her hands in her pockets, a classic move made by a person when not being forthcoming, and said it could be a mass, but it could also be because the dog is skinny. she said the dog looked pretty good other than that and she'd write up a action plan for getting the dog back in good health. she then left and sent in a tech with a itemized bill for blood work and shots over $500 worth. 

i then attempted to clarify what i came in for. i wanted to know the dogs health, if the dog appeared neglected or sick and what to do to help the dog gain the weight back. i wanted to know roughly how old the dog was, and what i could do to help the dog get healthy. i've never owned a dog before. i also said, i noticed the dog seemed stiff and i could hear her joints pop when she moved sometimes, and i would like information that could answer questions like, should i give the dog glucocamine?"". is it an injury or just because of the age? the tech left to speak with the vet again, and then returned and said, the vet says the dog is about 5, though we can't really confirm that. here is the prescription she wrote up. 

at this point, i was very aggravated. i exclaimed that i wanted information, dietary advice. my main concern was that the dog was underweight due to lack of food. i want to know things like what type of food is best to help the dog recover. i've never even had a dog before, which i said when i made the appointment and stated several times throughout the appointment. the tech looked baffled, and i told her that i was not going to return to this clinic ever again. i went to pay and i told them that i felt swindled. i explained that i still didn't even have answers for simple questions on what type of food is best to feed an underweight dog, and i didn't understand why their office couldn't give basic care advice and instead just kept writing up quotes for tests and drugs. 

at that point the tech came to the front and said she talked to the vet and the vet wanted me to have a handout about arthritis. i admit, i sarcastically thanked her for giving me information that i could have easily looked up myself online, and explained that now i still need to look up dietary information online and i think it's ridiculous that i should have to do that when i just paid $50 to talk to a veterinarian and have the dog examined. 
 
i left promising to contact the better business bureau. which i probably will do. 

i'm just at a point in my life where i'm sick of not getting what i pay for. is anyone with me on this? it's like i can even by an f%#^$^% sweater that won't unravel in a month because everything is made in china by 5 year olds, i buy used cars around 60,000 miles, because new cars are put together so shoddy that used cars with that kind of mileage already have new transmissions and alternators and starters... the repairs are better quality than what you actually get when you buy the car, unless you get a mechanic that insists that you have replace a $500 part in order to fix a $200 part, when 3 other people gave you quotes that didn't include that repair- or an electrician that insists the lighting in your business needs to be replaced or the lights aren't going to turn on, but when they find out that there isn't anyway to authorize that type of repair a miracle from heaven unfolds and the lights magically work once again. 

here's the truth people. everyone's out to get your hard earned money, and few ever offer quality service or merchandise in return. 

this veterinarian could have given me some advice like, since she's under weight you might want to feed her a puppy kibble or some wet food, or increase the portion- and also it wouldn't be a bad idea to do some blood work to see her overall general health. i could respect that, but not offering any advice on the animal whatsoever except for the tests and drugs, seems a bit ridiculous. and if they can't tell me anything about the health of the animal without the tests, then someone explain to me why on earth they are allowed to prescribe drugs? if you are that clueless as to the health of the animal without your $500 full work up, then how can you in confidence recommend $50 worth of prescription drugs? 

the only redeeming quality that i have to mention about this place, is the techs are nice and friendly."
119,negative,"do not bring your jeep here for service.  i started with a dead battery and brought it in to be replaced.  they told me they tested the battery and it was dead but not ""dead enough"" to justify replacing it to the jeep people and i would have to just wait for it to die again and bring it back in. (while it was there i said it was due for an oil change and asked them to do what was necessary service-wise at this time to keep my warranty in-tact. 450 dollars later after doing research i find out all but 1 service they performed had nothing to do with my warranty. they take advantage of you and will charge you for anything and everything they can get away with) i took my car back and called the service manager and explain that it wasn't practical to wait for it to die again and he agreed and found a way to get me a new battery.  a week later the new battery died and after bringing it in and they had it for a few days they still couldn't figure out what was wrong with it.  i know absolutely nothing about cars and i told them to check the new radio that was installed and that ended up being the problem.  they had my car for 3 days and had absolutely no clue what was wrong and i was the one who had to figure out the problem having no car knowledge at all.  three days after getting it back that time my check engine light comes on and when i bring it back i'm told ""there's probably just an air-pocket in the system."" they shut the light off and i'm told if it comes back on to bring it back in. exactly a week later the check engine lights turns back on and i bring it in.  i waited for an hour and they gave me my car back saying ""the system said to reboot it and turn off the check engine light. it'll probably turn back on in a few days and just bring it back then"".  i told them i wanted it fixed and i wasn't going to take it back just waiting for the light to come on. then the service advisor started to back-track and say ""well it might not come back on but it could. there is always a possibility the light could come on again but it also might not"".  i then asked to speak to the manager and when i went into his office i never really got a chance to explain my concerns or talk at all.  he immediately said ""you have a small leak that is going to take us a few days to find if you're ok with us keeping your car that long"".  i now have two different people telling me two different things wrong with my car.  i decided to leave my car there and they had it 10 full days and i was never once contacted by a manager or by michael harrington, my service advisor i had been dealing with the entire time.  i finally called them and asked what was going on and i was told that because they had shut the light off to give me the car back that second time that they couldn't use their code reader to find out what was wrong with it and they were still waiting for the light to come on.  even if their is no progress there is no excuse to have my car for 10 days and never once attempt to contact me.  i told him that it didn't make sense that the service manager told me specifically that i had a small leak and it was a difficult problem but he was saying they still didn't know what was wrong.  his answer was that because they turned the check engine light off they couldn't find exactly where the problem/leak was until the light turned back on.  had they not looked for a quick fix and turned my light off a second time they probably could have found the problem by then and fixed it.  after calling other service departments at different jeep dealerships and explaining the situation i decided to just pick my car up un-fixed and take it to a different jeep service department.  i would not recommend ever doing service with this service department, the service advisor michael, or the manager dennis. i highly recommend going to autonation. they knew immediately what was wrong with my vehicle and had it fixed and back to me in 2 days. wonderful service at autonation!"
120,negative,"if i could give negative stars, i would!!! paid over 1k to fix check engine light problem, and its still not fixed!!! good thing i have a friend at the emissions department at the dmv!!! i'll be giving him a call!! i wish i had reviewed the other bad encounters with this shop!! i guess there will be two claims in small claims court on this shop!!! stay away from this shop!!!!!!!"
121,negative,"i took my car to cornerstone to get an oil change and a free car wash. they told me that i needed to replace my transmission fluid even though it was recently replaced and still good. when i got my car back from the carwash, the check engine light was on. they had taken off my serpentine belt. i told them they needed to fix it because my car was working perfect before taking it in. after arguing with the attendant for a few minutes they finally put the belt back on. they told me that the tensioner was broken. after driving a few miles the belt fell off again and i had to get a mechanic to look at it. he told me there was nothing wrong with the tensioner and that they must not installed the serpentine belt correctly. when the serpentine belt fell off after leaving cobblestone, it was destroyed. they refused to pay for the damages. after an hour of arguing with the rep, i was able to get a few basic carwashes (not even a fraction of the cost of the mechanic or even the parts). this was my first and last time going to cobblestone. i don't even trust them enough to cash in on the ""free"" (cost me hundreds of dollars in repairs) car washes."
122,negative,"my 1998 honda civic had run fine for over a decade.  one day in the summer of 2009, it just died on me in the middle of traffic.  i had to have it towed all the way from university of phoenix stadium to south phoenix at a cost of over $100.  i chose good works probably based on the whole ""we're god-fearing christians who would never deceive our fellow man"" image that they exuded.  i paid another significant amount of $$$ to have good works tow my car to their shop.  i can't even remember what the diagnosis was but i dropped a good $1000+ with them.

my car started working properly again, for about a week, when suddenly the check engine light went on, the transmission started slipping, and the car pretty much went to hell.  i contacted good works.  it was too coincidental that the car worked wonderfully for 10 years and then, as soon as they're done fixing one problem, all these other issues pop up.

of course, they claimed the earlier problem they repaired was completely unrelated to this new transmission issue and they quoted me another arm and a leg to fix the new issue.  at that point, my money all dried up, i had no choice but to sell the car to a junk yard and go graveling to my parents to borrow their car.

no, i don't have 100% proof that they messed up my car, but part of their business model is their guarantee of the repairs.  my overall experience with them boils down to them making a pile of money on me and me selling my car to the scrap yard with a faulty transmission.  i certainly don't recommend them and am very suspicious that they actually did more harm than good to my car."
123,negative,"i took my acadia in to have the ac checked as it was blowing warm air when it gets hot. i made an appointment for 8:30am and dropped off the car just before that time. after my car had been there for 3 hours and still not hearing anything i called in to find out the status. 

when i called, i was told the rep, angie, was out with another person and would call me when she returned and informed that they were waiting for the tech to enter notes. after 40 minutes with no returned call, i called back thinking she should have returned by then. i ended up being transferred to a different person and then finally to angie. angie informed me that my car was going into the shop and it would be another hour before it was diagnosed.

that would have ment that my car was there for over 5 hours just to be diagnosed! not to mention that when i called to make the appointment i was told the fee for it to be diagnosed was $126 but when i got there, i was told it would be almost $160. 

needless to say, i advised to pull my car out and send the courtesy shuttle so i could pick up my car. they were very prompt about this. i must also add that the courtesy van drivers were very pleasant. 

this is, by far, the worst experience i have ever had while trying to get my car repaired. i will even be finding another authorized gmc service repair to do the factory recall repairs.

unless you have an abundance of time to waste for your car to be repaired,  don't go to this place."
124,negative,"the check engine light on the truck that i bought came on the same day that i purchased the truck.  
 the transmission was recently replaced and under a 3 month warranty but the shop that replaced it couldn't fix it. they let me drive it home before it was fixed and the engine overheated without any temperature warnings coming on. this time i took it to the nissan dealership. they told me the engine block was cracked and had probably been cracked for a long time. 
 i now have a different motor and a different transmission in the truck. i bought the truck 2 months ago and it has spent about 5 weeks in the shop. i traded in my 2001 pathfinder with the original engine and operating transmission. 
 the owner... chuck... did work with me. he also made it clear that the deal was done and the truck was mine. chuck let me use my own trade in as a loaner vehicle. he also paid for half of the motor that i had to buy and replace in the truck. 
 unfortunately, no amount of customer service from chuck could make up for the suffering i incurred by making this deal. i was out thousands of dollars in time and money within the first few months of buying the truck. i'd suggest taking these vehicles to the dealership and getting them to put a white glove on them so that you know exactly what you are getting. lessons learned."
125,negative,"this review is for the service department.  i brought my car in for an oil change ($49.95 after coupon!) and asked the tech run my check engine light code.  the service manager refused to run the error code because he said that it would not solve the problem and he recommended i do a full diagnoses at around $85 per hour.  i declined and asked him to humor me and run the error code which he again refused.  the next day i went to auto zone and they ran my error code and pointed out that it was caused by my gas cap not being fully tightened.  

it is remarkable that the dealership charges $50 for an oil change that you can get elsewhere for $20-30, refuses to do a simple service check, and tries to charge for something that is completely unneeded.  i will never go back to tempe scion for service!"
126,negative,"let me start out by saying i thought i had finally found a reputable and honest car repair shop, but to my disappointment, i was incorrect and fooled again. a little over 7 months ago, i took my car to get a rear brake checked and the front wheel, which appeared, be loose. i also asked them to check out the work done by the previous transmission repair, due to having issues with the work the other shop performed and i wanted a 2nd opinion. i dropped it off and waited for their call for the outcome of their diagnosis.  the manager called me and told me the rotors needed resurfacing, the pads needed to be replaced, the power steering pump needed to be flushed, and the booster pump needed to be replaced. he told me the total price ($1,100+) i authorized the work and it was done the same day.  i went to pick it up and discussed the work they did as well as what their opinion of the previous work done by the other shop. they also indicated other items of concern that they found and we discussed this impact of those items. they told me the loose front wheel was normal for this vehicle. so now, 7 months and 8000 miles, later the rear brake is grinding, same one they fixed previously and the front wheel is worse. i took the car back to them based on their written warranty for ""lifetime brake warranty"" and had them check it out. the results were the emergency brake caused the pads to contact the rotor and now the rotor and pads are shot and needing to be replaced. i do not use the e-brake so not sure how or why this happened. however, it is still my problem due to the e-brake was not something they repaired.   they also stated the power steering pump is leaking and they will repair and charge me for another flush. the cost to do all this work was around $800 and the warranty does not cover any of the new work.  here is my heartburn. they previously charged me $96.15 each or $192.00 for both to resurface two rotors, new rotors cost approx. $58.00 each. i checked other shops and they charge around $20 to resurface rotors. the cost for the brake booster was $377 and the most expensive i can find is $183.00. they worked on the power steering pump and now it leaks, but i have to pay to repair it. as for the front wheel being loose, now they say the bearings are bad and needs to be replaced. lastly, one of the previous items of concern from 7 months ago was the rear shocks were leaking.  since then, both shocks had been replaced and have a lifetime warranty . .not sure why or how this occurred. i realize now that i initially should have asked for an itemized cost of each line item, but i trusted them based on the reviews i had read and thought it was not needed and they were honest and fair . .lessons learned. i realize they have to make money to stay in business but i would think a fair and reasonable profit on parts (50%) would be acceptable, so as they say ""buyer beware"".
hope this helps others and maybe i am the exception to the others but thought i would share my experience regardless."
127,negative,"do not take your car to be serviced here.  i have received nothing but a run around from this dealership.  i have been on hold for 15 minutes as i type this just trying to see if my vehicle has been looked at.  my appointment was yesterday at 9am!!! my vehicle has been there for two days for recalls and to check the transmission which is not shifting properly.  this is a 2012 cruze with approximately 10,000 miles on it.  marty, service mgr., does not follow up with the customer to inform as to whether they have even looked at the car. horrible customer service.  what's the point of making an appointment if i am going to be without a car for days on end?"
128,negative,"don't believe the 4 star rating. they will rip you off just like they did to us. went to pick up the van we reserved and when we got there the car wasn't ready. the car they were supposed to give us had the side view mirror taken out due to the previous renter backing up into something. they said they can fix it in a couple of hours. they tried giving me another van but i heard one of the workers there say ""you can't give them that one, it has a broken transmission."" what the fuck?! i don't want no car with broken transmission if i'm taking it to another state, with kids as passengers.  then i see the manager tap the worker's shoulder and say ""don't worry about it."" as if silently telling him to shut your mouth. i told them i'd rather get my deposit back but they refused to give it to me. i was there for 3 hours telling them i want my deposit back but they kept insisting they can give me the car. so i ended up going home with no rented van and $300 poorer because they refuse to give my deposit.

also, there was another couple there arguing with them to get their money back. the lady told me that they've been trying to get their money back for 4 days and they tried to charge her for a car tha t cost more. 

do not believe the good reviews for this business, pretty sure they're fake customers."
129,negative,"warning: you could get ripped off if you are going to get your car fix here. better get a second opinion because they probably do not replace the parts! read my review! 

i'm furious and disappointed at their service dept!  i've been coming here for many years because i own a nissan, and i thought i could trust these guys. after i had my oil changed last week, sam one of their service advisors assisted me and suggested that i get my transmission fluid serviced, and tire sensor light replaced.  well, i took my nissan cube here yesterday to get them done, but as soon as i got home, the sensor light turned on again! i had this strange feeling that they didn't replace it, and instead just reset it (which by the way can be reset for free!)  how did i know? i took it to one of my old mechanic where i got an old quote. he told me nissan never replaced it but charged me $234.03 anyway. my former mechanic had reset this sensor  before for free and had quoted me $199 if i wanted to get it replaced there; however, i went to this nissan dealership service department even though it cost more because they have all my records in their computer system, 
 i've been coming here to get my oil change and other repairs, but now i think i'm going to look for an honest, and reputable shop that i can trust, and build a relationship with. i'm not sure i could trust these people again, i'm also going to invest in a car diagnostic device & app that can monitor my vehicle's health, decode my check engine light, and get maintenance alerts. i refuse to be taken for a ride.

i'll be speaking to their manager for sure, and reporting them to the better business bureau. this is not acceptable!


update: so i took time off (which cost me money!) to get my car repaired again, and reencountered sam. even though he was apologetic, and understood my situation, i was still not happy. according to him, their mechanic forgot to reprogram the system. so basically, their mechanic did a half-ass job! what else did this mechanic forgot to do i wonder? he assured me that they did replace the sensor, and i could even have it double checked by the former mechanic where i got my second opinion. i was still feeling very wary, and honestly, the only thing that could make me believe it is if they had shown me the brand new sensor package and if they have given me the old one so i could dispose of it myself. but whatever! 
after they fixed the issue, i left the dealership dissatisfied and skeptical. my next oil change appointment will be in 3 months, and it will take some time if i decide to come back here. i had been a loyal customer of this dealership, but this experience made me suspicious about their service."
130,negative,"always used to get oil change untill i had them do my transmission fluid change.  they put my life in danger!  had the transmission fluid changed and apparently they never took the old fluid out.  i found out on our way to disneyland that the transmission fluid was leaking out.  luckily i used yelp to find me a mechanic by my location.  it lead me to midas.  they pulled 6 quarts of extra fluid out.  what 6 quarts?? the owners manuel states it should be only 6 quarts.  very displeased at big o tires for dropping the ball.  

*update*

i went back to the store and had them reimburse me for the midas bill and thier bill.  ended up taking car to the dealer to have them change the fluid out"
131,negative,"yelps review process is totally rigged...what a joke!  they only claim to be impartial. 
i took my 2000 ford e-250 van in last week after i rebuilt the engine and transmission.  this isn't the first rebuild that i have done and it won't be the last, but it will be the last time i give virginia auto another dime!  i replaced just about every sensor and i used brand new parts while performing a complete rebuild.  chuck's speed shop did my block work @ $680.00.  between the engine and transmission, i have over $4,500.00 just in new parts, the labor was from myself...and the van does run.  i'm just not happy with the idle once the engine is at temp.

history: my van fired right up after the rebuild, but it began to run rough after warming up with 50 miles on the new rebuild.  the dash cluster temp gauge wasn't reading the temp, or it was inop., so i figured that the computer was unable to read the temp and make fuel mixture corrections . it turns out that the temp sensor on the cylinder head does this job, but virginia auto never mentioned this fact to me. in a weak effort to find what was wrong with my van, they checked the fuel pressure, which they said dropped off shortly after turning the ignition on.  they recommended changing out the fuel pump, fuel filter and swapping out the temp gauge with ford motor craft parts. i had already changed the fuel filter. i asked how much they would charge to install a new motorcraft fuel pump and they told me $900.00 - $1,000.00!!!  i asked how much the fuel pump would cost and i was told $600.00!!!  you can purchase the ford fuel pump for $297.00 from rockauto.com!  i chose the carter for $135.00 and they looked identical during the swap.  i used a new motorcraft temp gauge too.  virginia told me that they have never heard of ""carter"".  i'm not sure how much these guys know about anything.

my major complaint comes from having to argue over how much the diagnostics fee and time should run.  they gave me an attitude when i told them $300 - $500 was too expensive and i'd give them 2 hours, then i wanted a call because i wasn't giving them an open checkbook of mine.  their shop rate is $127.00.  the second service writer chimed in and informed me that they would need to retrace my steps on my rebuild because i might have stuff crossed, missing, or incorrectly routed, which pissed me the off!  i kept my cool and i told him that i took pictures, made diagrams, and i purchased the ford repair manuals, which are three thick books!  after just over an hour, i walked over and asked about the progress where i was informed about the fuel pump pressure, which they said they found within the first 20 minutes.  the rest of the time was spent doing god only knows what, but they didn't even come close to helping me fix the poor idle at temp or the rough start and they charged me $289.00 without finding a single issue.  note: they had the van for an entire day, but only worked on it between other jobs - this info came from the manager.  i told them what i didn't change out during the rebuild because there was only a couple parts.  i also wanted the timing checked, but they never wrote that down because they were way too busy pressuring me into giving them an open checkbook!  seriously, does anyone do honest work anymore?!

132,negative,"this is probably the worst service shop in town. i knew auto- service shops take advantage of customers who know nothing about cars. i was been here for a check engine diagnosis on 6/24/17. i believe the customer rep's name is ""travis"", claims that his technician couldn't find any issues (for obd code 0p300). he just happen to clear the code(turn off the check engine light) and charged me for diagnosis fee. the check engine light was on the very next day and stopped by for inspection. rep asked to drop off the car for detail inspection and at the end of the day came up with some stupid reason to charge me more. he started off with ""the head gasket is damaged and we have to check for any vacuum leaks and replace gasket and asked to leave the car for 5 days"". i knew that was not the issue and he is making up some story to get more money (quoted for $1500) since i stepped in his store. do not fall for their baits. go for a second opinion. i did the same, went to have this checked at ""kings auto repair"" by plaza rd and he said the issue was with crankshaft sensor and said it's nothing to do with head gasket and ended up paying $150. i'm a go to get my diagnosis fee reimbursed from griffin brothers."
133,negative,"i've never felt it necessary to post a review of any company before, but my experience with virginia auto service was so terrible that it needs to be written about. i just moved to arizona two months ago and my check engine light went on. panicking, i decided to take it to the nearest shop, which was virginia auto service. well, they charged me an upwards of $130 just to see why my check engine light was on. they told me i would need a new throttle body, which was going to cost $700, and then they listed another $700 of repairs that my car supposedly needed. appalled at how much it had already costed and how much it was going to cost, i took my car to a mechanic that a friend recommended. he took one look under the hood of my car and told me that my throttle body did not need to be replaced, using some choice words to describe the mechanic who did the test at virginia auto service, saying that the mechanic there is an idiot for thinking i needed to replace a throttle body. he said that my car probably just needed to be reset (which was done when they ran the diagnostics for my check engine light) and that it would run fine. lo and behold, i've been driving my car around now for two months without replacing the throttle body and my car has been running smoothly with no issues. thank goodness i trusted my instinct and picked up my car before i let them take care of a problem they created just to make money off of a young, inexperienced female who doesn't know anything about cars. and thank goodness for the mechanic that i found who actually told me the truth and saved me $1400."
134,negative,2 weeks after still don't get my transmission i guess after all they really make mistakes all the time i been call them this week every day and they been promise me that mys tramsmission will arrive today anytime is been already a week give me the same answer and finally get tired  of wait the final answer they give me is i don't have it and  what else do you want me to do i take  my business to o'reallys or car quest beside they are more lower prices and better quality tools and auto parts.
135,negative,got may transmission replaced 2 years ago and have had nothing but problems since . i went back about 6 months after repair and they said the last staff were al let go.  nothing has been don't aboit my vehicle to make amends . will never go back to aamco  because of it and nooni need a new car.
136,negative,first car a chevy cruze was dirty and transmission didnt shift propertly on automatic. gas tank only 3/4 full. came back got a second car- mazda 3 g8-------but when i got back they charged me $240 and i already paid thru expedia. ---the insurance should have only been $140. - $14 per day for 10 days.= $140 not $240.---rip off.
137,negative,"when i first moved to toronto, i took my car here for some simple scheduled maintenance items (oil change, transmission flush etc.) and found the place really nice and service very friendly. 

when i actually started experiencing some problems with my car (occasional stall, failure to start) i took my car here and it became a big problem. after three visits over three weeks with a whopping $1000 bill per visit, the problem was still there. 

i eventually took it to a different mechanic where they were able to diagnose and repair the car in an hour and half for about $750 (parts included). i recognized this as complete incompetence on the part of old mill's mechanics and went to see the service manager about it. nice enough guy, but unwilling to do anything for me.

of course i can't recommend old mill gm as a place to get repairs done, but i had no problem with their basic services like oil changes etc."
138,negative,"where do i even start with this joint...  first i started coming to this facility because the one in chandler off of the santan 202 was a complete hell hole nothing but problems at that one. anyways back in november i had an issue with my 2013 sentra. my vehicle stalled in the middle of a busy intersection . so i carefully was able to get my car off the road. long story short i was able to drop it off at this larry h miller facility overnight and the next morning the service advisor called me his name is mark he was great kept me informed with what was going on any new news he would call me he was great. come to find out there was an issue with my transmission that also had an open recall that i never got notice about but it was under warranty so they gave me a brand-new transmission and everything seemed fine. now come december 11 on my birthday of all days my car once again stalled in the middle of a different busy intersection almost getting hit by a huge truck! once again i got my car off the road! finally was able to bring it back to this nissan dealership overnight. the next morning never got a call from anybody to tell me what was going on with my vehicle. by around 12 i called in to see what was up. the service advisor his name was gary was a complete asshole, never once apologized for anything every time i would try to talk he would talk over me without hearing what i had to say and when i told him that once again my vehicle stalled in the middle of an intersection all he said was well this is a different situation it's not the same from last time. really? after all this ruckus with gary we asked to speak to somebody that was higher up than him like a manager. he gave us the info for the manager tyrel russel whom we have tried calling many times and no answer or call back! we also got some information on a bill brixley and tried calling him many times and either it goes to voicemail or the people hang up on us! what kind of service is this! please people save your money and go elsewhere this facility doesn't care about their customers all they care about is the money they're getting out of them!!!"
139,negative,"i am sorry to report that i do not recommend this establishment.

the manager was nice and was easy to work with.  i paid for a ""fully rebuilt transmission"" on my son's car.  the manager said ""everything inside is new, except for the gears themselves.""  it cost over $2900.

13 months and 4,400 miles later, my son, now off in college three states away, experienced transmission failure.  yes, four thousand four hundred miles later...

we had to find a local (to my son's college) transmission shop.  upon disassembly and inspection, this second shop showed me how the previous job was not done correctly, resulting in the quick failure.  the second shop owner was questioning what had even been replaced inside the case, and showed me several very worn items that he said any decent transmission rebuild would have replaced.

the warranty was 12 months, and being three states away, i did not attempt to negotiate warranty coverage from budget, partly because i cannot trust this show for further work.

avoid."
140,negative,"warning!!! stay away, avoid at all cost do not go to lv auto center. they are the worst auto repair shop in las vegas took my ford contour for automatic transmission. 1st paid $75 for transmission service didn't fix problem. went back again bad motor mount paid $365 still problem. went 3rd time need rebuilt transmission estimate $1957. took it right away aamco transmission, had a bad auto range sensor paid $143. this is the  worst place to repair your car. i have filed a complaint with nevada department of motor vehicles regarding this matter."
141,negative,"if i could give it no stars i would. my experience today was probably the worst example of customer service i had ever had to deal with in my life. i would not recommend this dealership to my worst enemy. i have a 2013 ford focus, which is a great little car, but it has a transmission problem. anyway i get a call from the service guy and he stated his findings. so i explained to him the history and what i experienced,  which he took to his technician. i called back after a few at which point the service guy rod puts his technician on the phone. this technician was the absolute rudest person i had ever spoken to, he interrupted me raised his voice and refused to listen to what i had to say. then after basically insulting me (insinuating  that i was lying)  by saying what i said happen could not happen he continued to rant on his opinion. it was at this point i hung up the phone called ford motor company and a different ford dealership. so unless you want to ruin your day i'd stay away from berge ford!!!!"
142,negative,"the summary:
- see my review of the neighboring ""napa autocare center"" for more of my horror story.
- transmission leak diagnosed as needing the leaking transmission cooler replaced.
- a seperate transmission shop said that the issue could have been mistaken for a leaking cooler, but actually was leaking from the transmission vent above the cooler.
- basically, a misdiagnosis. i never got the transmission fixed so i gave it two stars. they could have been right, but not likely.

the story:
brought my 2002 vw jetta to the neighboring napa autocare center for engine issues. was referred here to take a look at a small transmission leak. they diagnosed the leak as needing a new transmission cooler, which would have cost $800. we decided to think on it.

eventually ended up taking it to ""state to state transmission"" on bell road in northern phoenix. they said the issue could have been mistaken for a transmission cooler leak, but was actually ""blurping"" from the transmission vent just above the cooler lines. the guy at ""state to state"" said they could have been trying to replace the cooler then hitting you with a transmission rebuild, which it actually ended up needing, or they were just incompetent."
143,negative,"alexandra noel salon @ flamingo las vegas

 i arranged for nail appointments for myself and five additional friends and family members to receive nail services prior to my wedding on december 17, 2011. i made this arrangement through dallas holmes with total experiences  at caesar's palace. he had called to confirm pricing. i wanted to make certain that i could receive a gel manicure so i called the salon ahead of time to confirm availability as well as pricing. i was told $30 for each mani and $55 for each pedi.  this sounded perfect!  
   on the morning of the 17th i was so excited for our little spa day. we arrived for our appointment, and the young lady at the front desk seemed surprised we were there.  it felt as if things were in disarray from the time we arrived. i was called back first and taken to a side of the salon away from the rest of my party. feeling isolated was not exactly how i had pictured my day going.  this is where all of our problems truly began...  my technician, lisa, told me she could not do the shellac manicure i had hoped for and i could not go to another technician because they were all occupied with the rest of my party. she promised me her manicures would last 10-12 days, just like shellac, but with more versatility.  i told her regular polish doesnt last on me because i wash my hands so frequently  she informed me she had been doing nails longer than i had been alive and she knew what she was talking about. i agreed. what else was i to do when i had already been told no?  she made me take my jewelry off, including my engagement ring, and leave it in a cup. i voiced my concern with this, but was again brushed off.  i was told my hands looked ""awful"" and ""wrinkly"" and badly needed exfoliated and moisturized. ummm ok? she rushed me to the back sink where i was instructed to exfoliate my own hands. (not exactly pampering or relaxing or invigorating like the menu says, as i can do this myself at home anytime.) as i sat down to get ready for my paraffin dip, my technician and the technician doing my mother's pedicure began to bicker and argue over who should be responsible for buying more paraffin wax.  this was quite unprofessional and made the environment extremely awkward. again, not exactly what i had in mind. my hands were shoved into plastic bags for about three minutes before the wax was removed (i guess pulling the wax off was considered the hand and arm massage? i certainly hope not.) throughout my entire manicure, all i heard was about how her friend's husband was leaving her because she could not conceive and her best guy friend won't talk to her.  again, not exactly relaxing. my manicure looked awesome upon completion. i was very pleased. however, my joy wouldn't last long because my pedicure opened a whole new can of worms. my aunt's blue water was referred to as ""smurf pee"" and my orange water as ""pee"" by my technician.  awesome. just what i want to stick my feet in. lisa sat down and then announced, ""let me go rinse these real quick."". to my horror, she rinsed off the metal foot file and cuticle clippers. rinsed them off!  correct me if i am wrong, but i believe all non disposable metal supplies are to be sanitized appropriately by an autoclave or in a solution such as barbersol. i did not see one single sterile package opened. not for myself nor any of my party. this is revolting. lisa proceeded to look at the bottom of my feet and cause a huge, embarrassing scene over the fact that i pull off my calluses. i am not proud of this habit and did not need it being put on display for the entire salon on my wedding day. she began to file away my calluses with this unclean file. i did not even think to protest because i was too busy wanting to crawl under a rock to hide from my embarrassment. of course she filed too deeply on my right foot and made me bleed. perfect! a sore foot on my wedding day, just what i needed.  she put this file, with my blood obviously on it, back in her little drawer to be rinsed off for the next customer. i need not even go into the dangers of blood borne pathogens and the high risk of their transmission with improper sanitation. nobody wants a side of hepatits or mrsa with their mani/pedi.  we were upcharged $181 that we did not agree to.  poor customer service..."
144,negative,"have been to this location before for flushes, etc and had no problems.  however, after failing a smog test, i drover over here bc its close by.  i wanted them to check codes and let me know what was wrong.  about 5 hours later, they called to tell me that my ecm (car computer) and fuel pump were bad, and that there was probably going to be even more repairs needed once they got into it.  my quote for the 2 things was $1600, and anything else they found was going to be more.  
i went next morning, picked up my car and paid my $90 diagnosis fee.  i took the car to my regular mechanic who checked everything and the only thing that was wrong with the car was a burned out check engine light bulb.  fuel pump was perfect, ecm working perfectly.  he told me that there were old codes that hadn't been cleared, and once he cleared them, the cel went off.  
went back to smog station next day, and passed with no issues.  so, if you need your tranny fluid changed, this place might be ok.  for real engine issues, go to a real mechanic.  these guys are throwing darts at the problem and charging you for it.  at the very least, get a second opinion before you green light any engine repairs."
145,negative,so if u could give them zero stars i would bought a car from them and as i'm driving home it overheats call rob and he says it shouldn't be ?? says come back next week as it was a friday night. by monday the check engine light is on (meaning he just cleared the engine codes) we had a mechanic look at it and hoses were un done things were zip tied together and it needs a new hydraulic fan which would of been $1800!!!! only paid 2800$ for the car we were expecting some things would need to be replaced but he knew the car was bad and sold it to me with my kids there knowing i'm spending my whole tax refund on this vehicle ! so we call rob back and say look can you fix this he tells us to bring it by then he says he doesn't have a mechanic for us to fix it ? that he fired the guy who sold us the car ??? he sold us the car like what is he implying that someone other then himself sold us the car and told us the fan was broke ? yes we test drive it but not long enough for it to overheat from fan not turning on then come to find out their is a vacuum leak it needs new brakes new spark plugs bad engine coils like those are all simple things with regular wear and tear but he new there was something wrong with the cooling system he said he replaced the radiator and thermostat cause replacing those items is 90% cheaper then a new fan. he showed me 17 years of service reports on the vehicle which is the only reason we bought the car it also did not have a door handle he said he would overnight it to us which he never did so i still have to roll down the window to open the car door so embarrassing. so disgusted and am currently filing paperwork to sue this man. also did a good ol bait and switch as ad said 94k and it's actually 103k which i thought was just a typo now i know this is what he does. terrible place oh and the car is still not drivable been over a month now.
146,negative,"i won't comment on the merits of the writing, as the paper will likely appeal most to those of a conservative bent. the paper makes no bones about it, and that is not why i am rating the paper. the sun reinforces the views of those who generally support small-c conservative viewpoints (not surprising for a western canadian news outlet), just as the cbc has an obvious bias towards small-l liberal points of view. these are not reasons to rate highly, or poorly.

what i can comment on are some of the business practices of the sun. i've had several letters to the editor published in the last 15 years and i get the impression they are honest in their editorial dealings. my comments were sometimes compressed or cleaned up, but never substantially altered. i can't say i always enjoyed the one-liner from the sun's editor that followed my comments in print, but was always happy to see my comment was given consideration.

on the other hand, my concerns about the editorial tone of the paper in recent years, particularly with the most recent editor, were dismissed. in particular, the use of language previously considered vulgar, which i thought was employed for shock effect in the main editorials. the editor took the time to respond, to his credit, but dismissed and even minimalized my concerns rather than acknowledging them. i felt the paper had continued on a trend towards sensationalism which in retrospect is probably considered necessary (by them)  in order to maintain flagging numbers.

i began subscribing three years ago mainly because i like the tabloid size of the paper - it fits on a table at a food court perfectly, is portable, and the outlook of the paper is one that matches my own. however, home delivery has been poor. my delivery guy drives a car with no muffler, arrives at 5 a.m. to throw the paper onto the front step, sometimes hits it, sometimes lands it in a puddle or snowbank, then departs. sometimes he overshoots and i listen to the sunday edition bounce off the glass of my screen door, or put dents in my siding. sometimes it doesn't show up at all. the sun's complaints line rectifies the missing issues quickly enough, but in recent weeks i decided i had enough. i complained for two weeks that i wanted the paper in my mailbox. they agreed it was not an unreasonable request; people shouldn't have to bend injured backs, put on shoes and parkas to forage for papers, or fish them out of puddles. the driver disagreed, apparently, as not once did the paper make it to the mailbox despite repeated assurances from the help line staff that they were 'escalating the issue'. either the driver wasn't getting the message, someone plain didn't care, or the help staff were lying to me.

the final indignity came when the paper stopped coming altogether - my subscription lapsed due to an expired credit card. despite my email address and phone number being on file - no one bothered to tell me. they just stopped sending the paper, on a weekend. 

i left the subscription lapsed. i love the idea of paper newspapers, but i suspect i will look to the national post, or perhaps just save my money and read the news online, as much as i hate the idea. too bad, as the short articles in the sun were of great interest to me, and i enjoyed reading veteran reporters like peter worthington, and even opposing points of view from liberal-insider warren kinsella. their obnoxious driver, and the total lack of commitment to customer service on the part of the paper, has robbed them of what would probably have been a life-long customer."

i have a 2013 hyundai sonata
called in on 9/6 due to car couldn't pass truck on fwy and started slowing down.  felt transmission slipping.   first appt. 9/8 at 11am.   asked to drop on 9/7 after closing due to work.   dropped off car, only issue was transmission slipping.   
started of with debra but switched to chris as advisor.   (he was very nice), he called and said they would get me a rental as it would be until mon/tues to fix and that air filter was bad.  i came got belongings saw air filter and okayed having that replaced.  nothing else was wrong with car.   nothing else advised by hyundai as well.   didn't hear back monday.  called finally returned tuesday that turbo and couple things under the powertrain warranty needed to be replaced and they would f/u weds.   called thurday 9/14 to get status before working late shift.  got vm stating car done but now there was bent rim, bad bearings and hub.   nothing to do with transmission.   this was unacceptable and i left message with service manager.   i would understand if i was at fault or did something but this happened within week of car being there.   james the service manager returned call on saturday 9/16 and said he talked to tech amd said car came in that way.  went on to say he personally knew him for 14 years so if he drove car off cliff he would cover so knows he didn't do it.  i asked for further research as the car did not come in that way and is no undriveable.   he said he would do his due diligence but most likely would not do anything.  the car sat fri/sat and i brought to tire shop today to have inspected.   was told and got in writing, nothing is wrong with bearings or hub and that i do have bent rim.   

to me this shows the tech has lied to say i have repairs needed in tune of $1200 cause they had to warranty issues to transmission.  that and they bent rim or swapped with another vehicle.   no matter what the service manager will side with employee even when another shop said they were lying about rest.  

now until i can replace rim, it's unsafe to drive to car.  i am in hospital with family on life support and have 2 kids under 3 years old. 

waiting to see how the follow up goes but until then i am upset i am being called a liar and the fact my car came back the way it did.   and now there are 2 more recalls and i am scared to even take it back.   

very upsetting since i use to have great relationship in service.  but most left in change a few years ago

follow up on sunday by service manager:

belinda i have 20 years experience as a master tech, you were quoted a bearing and hub due to the extent of damage to the wheel, to assume that those items are not damaged from impact isem.  i spoke with you extensively about this yesterday,  with all due respect to whomever you took the car to, i am not getting into a he said, she said with them.  i spoke with you extensively about this yesterday, and i told you i will do what i can to check what little video i have.   

monday 9/18:
call from service manager james.
i don't care who or what looked at  your car.  they are irresponsible and have no clue about cars and hyundai is not responsible and will  not fix it period.  i trust people here and not you.  we followed steps and there is reason i am in charge.  i have 20 years experience.   then he went to say, if you fix here great you got your quote, take it somewhere else and get rim only and drive and god bless you when you get in accident."
148,negative,"first experience with this shop was fine and they repaired the transmission for about $2700.00 which was fine and all. six months later it starts slipping so we take it back up there and it's just over the 12 month/12,000 mile warranty and want to charge another $1600.00 to fix. in my opinion if they did a better job ""fixing"" the transmission the first time we wouldn't be having this issue the second time. anyways we decided not to have it fixed with them a second time and got rude, cold service. wouldn't recommend them to anyone. save yourself the money and hassle."
149,negative,"do not buy a vehicle from this dealership...they say the vehicles are all inspected by their mechanic..well their mechanic is a back yard mechanic that works out of his back yard in maryvale... we bought a pick up truck from this dealership in may of this year i was concerned about the transmission on the truck since it appeared to be a work truck with an after market towing package installed which means it may have done a lot of towing and i wanted to look at other trucks, marisol our sales person who was very nice assured me the truck had been inspected by a their mechanic and nothing was wrong with the transmission or engine..and they gave us a we owe to have the serpentine belt replaced and oil change and spare tire put on front passenger side cause it was suppose to be in better shape then the one on the truck (it wasn't), the second day we had the truck the fuel pump went out they took it to their mechanic and had it fixed and had the we owe work done and we then went to pick it up from the address in maryvale (thats how we found out about the mechanic working out his backyard)...after that we had to have 4 new shocks put on and 4 new tires (all 4 according to tire shop were rotted from the heat so truck sat for a long time) and the fuel system cleaned since their mechanic didnt do that when he changed the fuel pump and some other things that were little and not real important but should have been taken care of before they put it on the lot for sale,  then the  first payment came due to finance first week of june we made the payment early and a week later the transmission gave out completely.  we talked with our finance company who said either they (network) need to fix it or they would unwind our deal and put our loan towards another vehicle at one of their other vendors.  on 7/23/2016 network came and towed our truck to their transmission shop to have it fixed i left messages last week trying to get an update, today i finally talk to edward who tells me that they went ahead and had transmission rebuilt and it was $1250.00 which they would only pay $725.00 of i told him well i did not agree to that and he knows it so i would not be picking up the truck nor paying any of the bill and that i would call back our finance company fill them in and we will go with our option of unwinding this deal.  now we are letting our finance company handle it from there with network and we are meeting with a lawyer to see about suing for down payment back, between the down payment and the repairs we made on that truck for 30 days we had it we are out $2400 dollars and don't even have the vehicle.  so beware of them, take it to your mechanic and have it looked at if you do decide to buy from them."
150,negative,"if i could i would give this place no stars, horrible service, worst experience ever with a auto shop. armando, the manager is the worst, only steals money from customers. the experience we had was awful, he suggested a radiator for a car issue, when the car needed both the radiator and a new transmission, he charged us a whole lot of money $800 to be exact for a ""radiator"" that was supposedly new but was old and damaged. his work did not last more then 2 days. we have tried to get our money back and his a scum. what ever you do do not go to this place!!!! stay away!!! the company needs to get rid of armando and his a manager, gives royalty auto services a really bad reputation. stay away people!!!!"
151,negative,i would love to give them no stars but must pick one in order to leave a review i took a check engine light code in and they supposedly fixed it i paid to get it fixed and then the check engine light came on again i check to see what the code was same code same part now they want to charge me to do a diagnostic check engine on a something they should have already fixed give a person a break not all of us have a million dollars in our bank-account i have heard they were shut down for fraudulent dealings why are they still open then i found this out after i went there to get my car fixed
152,negative,"i went into the firestone on rock springs to get a simple promotion. it was a special on an oil change that gave a discount on new wiper blades as well. i had been to firestone before to replace some times and a few oil changes beforehand so i figured things would go fine. after my oil change, i noticed a rather bad oil leak in my car. so i brought it back in. i was told that this oil leak is just a coincidence since i had an older car (1998 honda accord) and a lot of the parts were old. what firestone didn't know was that i bought this car from a mechanic who replaced a good amount of things under the hood. it's not a coincidence. deciding to place some trust in them, i agreed to have dye added into my car to find out just where this leak was coming from. i also asked if the drain bolt was secured and was told yes, no issues. after waiting the 5-7 days as requested to, i brought the car back in. apparently there were multiple leaks and i needed to replace the oil pan, coolant and crank system, the transmission and all this other stuff that would add up to $2600. i already felt like i was getting the run-around. out of the two visits i asked if the drain bolt was fine and was told yes, no issue. also told my tire pressure was good (which later at another shop was told differently). i took my car to another shop called zenith auto and immediately, they noticed oil leaking at the the oil drain plug and replaced the drain plug crush washer. it was $31 to replace that piece and stop the leak. i went back to firestone and confronted them about this. immediately i was given a refund (which to me means they knew they messed up.) but never did henry, the man i spoke to 3 times, admitted fault. i asked if the washer was normally replaced during an oil change and he told me only if it has to. i didn't buy that answer so i called two other firestones in the area and both told me they would replace the washer when doing the oil change. i was lied to. multiple times. henry, and firestone, have no integrity. i wasted 2 weeks with them to find out such a simple thing had gone wrong. if they just admitted that they messed up, i would have been alright but no.. henry continued to lie to my face about the issue. 

and of course, the claims specialist who i have been talking to takes 4-5 days to respond to me. i had to take all action on my own. 

by far one of the worst experiences i ever had anywhere and i would not recommend anyone to go here for any type of service unless they feel like getting lied to or swindled."
153,negative,"i went to richards auto clinic to have them take a look at a car i was considering buying. they charged $100 to make a list of some of the problems, but were unable to identify where or how many leaks oil leaks the car had, or why the check engine light was on. for an extra 60 dollars on top of the first $100, they'd do a ""diagnostic"" and look for why the light was on. i thought i was already  hiring them to see how the car was running? anyhow, they said they didn't know how long the car would work. the car owner and myself parted ways, and he drove off down the road. i was with my friend, who drove in that direction as well. she saw the car broken down on the side of the road two blocks away, and her diagnostic was free!"
154,negative,"i got some estimates from different shops and jesse sounded sincere and beat all others in price quote. he quoted $1300 for transmission job and promised that he will put all parts brand new when he rebuilds it. on day two into the project he calls me early morning telling me that my transmission case has a crack so he needs $200 more to replace it.
very hesitantly i agreed. for me now the job is of the same amount as everyone else quoted at $1500.
when i went to pick the car up he added $60 for service and $67 for tax. instead of his original quote of $1300 i ended up paying $1627
i hope this transmission will last me few years otherwise i will be back to update my review.
i do not like doing business with people who thinks that they can keep adding on $$s now that you are stuck with them..... not honorable !!"
155,negative,"seniors beware there service department will take advantage of you like they did to my 76 year old dad who lives on social security. he took his pick up truck in to get a sensor light replaced and they told him that he needed his brakes flushed transmission flushed new spark plugs and the list goes on. so, my dad being old and worried that his car may brake down on him if he didn't get this services done agreed to it. this is what you need to know all the services they recommended was done already by my son who did all those services just 2 days before he brought it in. my dad who is having memory loss didn't remember that his grandson already did the services. if the mechanics took the time to call back and say you know what? we checked your truck out and your spark plugs are new and your fluids are all clean you don't need these services but they didn't they ended up charging my dad 2200!! he only wanted a sensor replaced. they saw an opportunity and they are now making his social security checks go to them for the next few months to pay this debt. i called the manager keith in the service department explained the situation and he had nothing to say about his mechanics checking to see if this even needed to be done. they just told him that this needed to be done without even looking at his fluids and spark plugs etc. they took advantage and they know it and they wouldn't even make it right when i confronted them on it. there located in a senior community so i'm sure they are doing this to a lot of other seniors. i can see why they have a 2 star on yelp. it's sad that they treated my dad like that took advantages of a good man that served our country and is a kind hearted man to be taken advantaged of. i hope this dealership reads this review and some how gets in the right hands to make this right."
156,negative,"this business was basically strait forward. my sales lady pam was a sweetheart but lacked basic muscle car knowledge. she told me the transmission had a reverse  manual valve body sol i was under the impression that i would be shifting the car myself,  i called her back after receiving the car with trouble shifting it.  pam then explained that it was an auto transmission and does not have a reverse manual valve body. this was very disappointing. she obviously had no knowledge of high performance automatic transmissions and what a reverse manual valve body does -  you shift it yourself.  she also told me that the car was electronically fuel injected.  after purchasing the car i saw that it was carbureted.  having known all this may have changed my decision on purchasing the car and definitely would have changed what i paid for the car.  these issues should have been brought to my attention by someone with more knowledge of the car.  this is not the car i expected to receive and i should be reimbursed the cost to have it altered in the way i was explained it was built- i.e. a reverse manuel trans body installed on the transmission and a fuel injection system installed in place of the carburetor. i would also accept financial compensation  to have these things done. pam was a nice lady but lacked the knowledge to sell a car of this caliber.  street side customs should have given me a complete accurate description of the car. i hope that financial compensation will be forth coming to make a satisfied customer. cost to complete the car as described would total about $2000-#3000 dollars. sorry pam but you sold me a vehicle deferent than what  iwas told i would be receiving. if you want do undo the transaction i would be satisfied with that as well but i feel i was completely misinformed on what i bought and basically dupped. id prefer to not involve lawyers will take it to that. 2-3k is a very low estimate for what i was lied to about."
157,negative,"worst experience of my life, purchased a vehicle from them, no check engine light car has 59k miles and is throwing a hidden code for misfire. have had the car now for only 32 days. so how long has the code been there. finance manager also asked for a picture of my social security card sent to his personal cell phone. and if it was not sent to him he was going to come take the car back after having it for 3 weeks. called dealer to ask what they could do for me regarding my wifes cars issues. and he said i can't do anything. you purchased it and it's passed the 15 period. what a bunch of bull. 17k for a car that is sitting in my driveway undrivable till repaired by my pocket. never purchasing a vehicle from such shady and unhelpful dealer again. #1 in volume. 0 in service."
158,negative,"i had a weird and irritating experience here and i won't come here again despite living just a block away. i brought my car in for an oil change and the guy who was working told me my transmission was ""about to go"" and i should try to get my money back on my car. he didn't really take the time to explain exactly what the issue was aside from some grass they found under the hood and a ""dent"" on the motor (?) and was pretty dismissive. i'd had no symptoms of a problem but took my car to a shop right away. they found no issues at all with the transmission.

the oil change is super quick, under 15 min, but it's on the expensive side ($65). all in all, so not worth it to give this place my business."
159,negative,"not a great experience. i recently bought a porsche boxster s from this dealership for my dealership. dealership should have stated that car had a major transmission issue. we completely understand a minor issue but a 30,000 mile porsche with 2nd gear popping out each time should have been disclosed to us before purchase. dishonest seller. beware!"
160,negative,"my pontiac g6 stopped driving forward suddenly, would only go backwards. i had my car towed to harb's. they charged me $80 just to look at it, and didn't hesitate to tell me that my transmission needed to be replaced. i declined the repair and had my car towed home. fast forward to today. i had it towed to auto repair technology (they paid for the tow), then they checked and diagnosed it (for free). within 30 minutes, they found the actual problem with the car and had it fixed and returned to me in one day... for a fraction of the cost! so harb's had me pay $80 and they didn't even find the correct problem, and they were prepared to rebuild my entire transmission. seems shady to me. probably because i'm a woman. not trustworthy."
161,negative,"found this place as the top ratted oil change business on yelp in the las vegas area.. i called to ask about rates, was quoted $90 for full synthetic oil change.. i asked if they were busy and was told ""no, come on in"" 
when i showed up the places didn't look too busy, i walked in and was helped by a ricardo i believe.. told him i had called and asked again for the full synthetic for my bmw. i was asked to sign a price agreement and was asked for my keys.. 
now this is where busy bugg failed my expectations, if you say you're not busy, why did the oil change take 1hr and 15 mins to complete.. 
and once you were finished, why was i told my car is now leaking engine fluids and transmission fluids..? 
normally when i'm with a trusted mechanic, they will show me the problem and advise me on what the problem could be.. 
so i left feeling disappointed about this new exciting problem.. 
secondly, after i get the oil changed on my bmw, i can tell the difference in the cars performance immediately when i pull away and open up the engine.. usually an increase in performance! 
not this time! 
my car is under performing and feeling like the wrong oil was introduced to the cars system.. i've owned my car for five years, when you know you know..! something is not right.. 
so sorry busy bugg, you've lost a real one here.. i will not return .. and now i have to flush my system to be sure for my cars safty smh.. not cool"
162,negative,"after being repeatedly lied to by the service manager at courtesy mazda, the service manager at audi for no charge researched mazda defects and found that a simple motor mount would fix the grinding transmission.  a $30 part, audi replaced the part and the car worked perfectly.  btw this was a warranty claim, maybe some fraud is going on at this dealership in order to keep warranty claims down.

i cooled off and just ignored the issue, as much as i wanted to see how many billable hours i could rack up their legal team.  a sales guy from their dealer calls me trying to get me to upgrade to the new speed 3.  i told him what happened and he said the management is different and they will fix this issue.  so i come into the dealership and spoke with a sales manager and said, forget about the money, the service manager lied to my face, to mazda, to audi and treated me like trash.  all i want is an apology.  he said that's it?  i said that's it, he promised to make it happen and to call me before noon.  not only did he not bother to call me, but when i called later that day he said that the service manager refused to apologize and said i was an irate customer.

please do not buy from them, even parts.

163,negative,"i meant to go to charlie's which is a much more established shop attached to this location.  i didn't realize that they were a separate entity until they had already looked at my car.  the mechanic made a proper diagnosis and a fair price on repair.  i decided i would get a second opinion. they had my car on the alignment rack and began to take it off.  when taking it off the rack my muffler made contact with the rack and bent my muffler and broke off its mount.  i watched as the fashioned a mount by cutting a mount in half and rigging it to secure my exhaust.  i then got in my car and noticed it was rattling.  the mechanic told me that sound was there when i brought it in.  as i drive this car everyday i am highly aware of my car. he then got loud with me and said that he would rack it in a minute and blamed my muffler for being too low.  after this i decided not to even bother and that they were a typical shady mechanic.  i took my car next door to charlie's like i intended initially.  they racked my car and there were two large dents in my muffler, luckily no holes in exhaust. it was rattling because the mounts were wrong and vibrating against my frame.  i asked charlies to weld my exhaust and diagnose and repair.  after all was said and done it cost me 40 dollars more for them to weld and the cosmetic damage which i am not too concerned about.  what concerns me is that the owner was the one who was driving and was perfectly willing to try to pass my car off as ok.  this should serve as a warning as a shop that has no pride and no intention on taking care of customers, just taking money.  don't make the same mistake i did and go to charlie's"
164,negative,"if there was an option for negative stars this business would receive 5 negative stars. let me start by saying that our family has bought over 5 cars from this dealership and would think we would be treated with more respect. my mom went in for a check engine light on her rav 4 this week and received the worst customer service we have ever experienced. first of all, for asking a simple question she was talked down to and when she asked for the supervisor, she was lied to and said he wasn't available. the assistant manager on staff (rick mckenzie)was then called. not only did he not greet her but had a bad attitude as it was. she then explained the issue and because my mom wasn't sure about the issue, she put my dad on the phone with the manager. the call dropped and the manager immediately showed anger and proceeded to toss the phone at my mom! he tossed the phone with such anger, that the phones case popped off. she asked him why he'd done so, and his reply was ""your husband hung up on me"". she told him that was no reason to toss her private property, and much less to a lady with a small child with her. he walked away. she spoke to someone else about the supervisor and was pointed in the right direction. the supervisor did nothing but proceed to say that the assistant manager was ""only human and was therefore acting out of frustration"". when the assistant manager was called over once again, he denied everything. he eventually admitted to throwing the phone at my mom. he said he ""apologized"" and walked away. 

this is no way to treat a loyal customer or a human for that matter. do not ever use this dealership. they don't care about the customer or retaining good relationships. worst experience ever. they humiliated my mother because they said they couldn't ""understand her accent"". this was very rude and demeaning. they offered no sincere apology and didn't seem to care that their employees aren't friendly to customers."
165,negative,"wish i could give them a 0!! just purchased a car from this dealership wednesday night. brought it in today to have the windows tinted. the consultant comes in the lounge tells me my car is ready, we walk outside and only as we get closer to the car he tells me my windshield cracked when it was going through the wash and has been spreading since. just matter of fact, then he asks me if i have replacement windshield insurance and would i like them to contact the company. no apology, no notice when it happened. just, there had to be dents in the windshield before we started the tint call your insurance, basically just deal with it. the manager comes out with a smile on his face, sorry there's nothing we can do. apparently this is the type of service that earnhardt toyota scion provides!"
166,negative,"i went here because of the reviews.  these guys charge more than hendrick bmw and they don't have loaner cars.  they charged $73.67 for an oil change, hendrick $60. cabin air filter replacement (i provided filter) $47.50.  that was really high.  when i picked up the car, the bill said the check engine light was on, said i declined service.  they never even asked about fixing it!  back to hendrick for me."
167,negative,"save your time and money and go somewhere else!!  my husband and i purchased a brand new 2015 jeep cherokee trailhawk 4 months ago.  the sales guy was nice but 2 weeks later a part of the door handle fell off and our jeep started to have electrical issues and we would feel a shudder motion while driving it. despite of the fact that shawn jordan, the service manager, admitted to my husband that he indeed felt a shudder driving the car and that he thinks our car needs a transmission software update. mr shawn jordan told our case manager from chrysler a complete different story. nothing was ever fixed and the vehicle didn't feel safe experiencing the electrical issues and driving in it with my kids. last wednesday (july 22nd) i brought my car in for an oil change, having my newborn with me and was later told i needed a software update. due to my lack of trust into their service department. chrysler advised me to go to a different dealership and i immediately took my car to a different jeep dealership after leaving moore chrysler in peoria,  which told me that only 1 out of 3 software updates were updated in our car. so if chrysler puts out software upgrades that fix transmission related issues, how are they going to get better if the service center at moore does not update them? but they only installed one. also they never checked into door sensors or the after market alarm system that moore installed into our vehicle and vehicles they have on the lot to rule out that our electrical issues are caused by those. if you want honest, helpful and polite customer service and have your brand new vehicle fixed, you will not find it at their service center."
168,negative,"i bought a new genesis sedan at the dealership.  after two days, brought it back because of a defective transmission.  the dealership did not want to know me.  they do not stand behind what they sell.  avoid!"
169,negative,"i had a really upsetting experience and wanted to share as a cautionary tale to others considering this service department. i had the opportunity to provide personal services to an elderly woman last week and took her to get her car repaired for a scheduled service. this woman has 30k miles on her toyota corolla. not only is she in ill health but likely suffering from some age-related dementia. from the minute we took her there, the service advisor talked down to her and immediately upgraded her ""service need"" to a higher price. i interrupted to ask for clarification on her behalf and was also talked down to. we went to the house to wait and she got a call saying they needed to do brakes and needed new tires. she told them over the phone she did not want these things now. we returned to the dealer to get her car and were told her total was $515. she was quoted $260 for her services originally so i asked what is going on here? service advisor told me ""we told her she needed these other flushes and she agreed"" .... i was with her when she took their call and did not hear any agreement to any additional services. what a shameful way to take advantage a vulnerable person. she felt totally unprepared to pay for this bill and on a fixed income was understandably upset. 

i own a toyota. i will never go to this place and never will i consider buying from them. i will tell everyone i know of this experience. shame on you!"
170,negative,"i do not recommend this shop to anyone.  they are not honest and do a poor job of all the work they say ""needs"" to be done.  we've had the same experience of others that have had bad experiences that they get sold and told their car needs this and that just to fix the problem.  they don't even fix the problem and the things they do ""fix"" just break and cause more issues with the car.   what would have ended up being less than $100 repair job at another shop cost me almost $2,500 after what they say ""fixed"" my car and was needed for maintenance on the car anyway, ended up destroying more of the car.  then when i asked to talk with the manager/owner, i got the run around, i was then told he arrived but would not speak with me, then found out he really isn't the owner.  this shop is full of lies and will end up costing you more money.  i am not surprised that there are about 4 other reviews that for some reason are not being accepted as reviews that also complain about basically the same issue i have.  those complaints were all written in the last couple months, the same time frame i had my issues with this company.  please understand this is not a place you want to get your car repaired."
171,negative,"turned away for smog check cause i had a 2012 diesel truck. should post that on their website


what jiffy smog wouldn't do. the muffler shop did. thank god i don't have to drive all the way to north las vegas like jiffy smog said i would have too"
172,negative,"i had my buick serviced today at this dealer. i had a recall taken care of there. i also had my check engine light come on a few days ago. so i had them check out the problem. it turned out i needed a new thermostat and a complete flush. due to needing my car and no time to shop around, against my better judgement i let them do the service after agreeing to a $550.00 estimate. i knew it was bit high but i had no choice. i needed it done. in the pass i have found buick of centennial much less on services.. i called centennial buick and ted wynns firestone and they both quoted me $200.00 less then autonation west sahara on the same service. unfortunately the work was already done. i asked the service agent why their service was so much higher. his reason was that centennial buick had over 5 new owners in the last few years and all they have is service issues on work they have done and ted wynn does not us genuine gm parts. i told him, sorry gm parts are not worth $200 more. he also stated they are a gm corporate dealer and centennial buick is a franchise. so obviously gm franchise dealers are not as good at their own corporate or corporate dealers gouge gm customers. either way, the work seems done correct and the service agent was very nice. but i will no longer have my car serviced at this dealer because i feel that i was completely priced gouged especially comparing between two buick service centers. so buyers beware and shop around. i usually do, but time was not on my side. live and learn and hope this review helps many learn about this dealer."
173,negative,"brought my vehicle to this business to have my transmission rebuilt last year.  was given a 2 year-24000 mile warranty.  had a leak, made sure that fluid levels stayed constant until i could bring it in.  brought it in, was told that there was a leak in one of the coolant fittings.  i asked if the fluid level was down and the tech told me it was fine.  shortly after it was ""repaired"" i started to get a transmission hot alarm.  brought it in and was told by the owner that it was a false alarm and that there were other engines codes that were causing ""false"" codes from the transmission.  brought the vehicle in to the dealership and got all codes repaired.  drove about 50 miles and got the alarm that transmission was hot.  called all-tranzmission and the owner accused me of driving with low levels, told me i was 4 quarts low off the top of his head, started to yell at me telling me the problems are my fault and won't do anything about it just because he doesn't want to lose any money.  stand behind your warranty!!!!  no more return business or referrals from this person any more.  very poor customer service."
174,negative,"over charged big time
as i learned all carx are indendently owed and operated.  not all carx are created equal.

i have recently moved from another city and have only good thing to say of the carx in the other town.   i went to carx when i had a muffler problem and when carx gave me the estimate i called my old carx and the manager talked it through and my bill dropped.  all this is a lead in to the big over charge.  i had a starter replaced and was called with the estimate.  the service manager started in with a $500 starter+ lifetime gaurentee starter or the $400 starter plus labor.  haveing no choice i picked the cheaper model.

the service manager then tried to sell a myrid of work, some justified , but at these prices i'll just take his advice and gosomewhere else and see if i really need it and i bet i can afford it.

carx always has coupons and took 10% off parts section of the bill however, with jacked up prices they are not doing anyone a favor.

i used ther great internet to cheak the national average on starter replcement and i also called my old great carx guy and found that the installed dealer price for a starter  (the high price) is under $400 installed.

the great thing about the internet (/www.repairtrust.com) and is you can cheak your price and spread the word about poor business practice.

looking for a recommendation for honest car repairs."
175,negative,"my girlfriend just got an oil change done here, she asked that they check the car over because we are going out of town. it is roughly a 100 miles later, 12:21pm, and we stopped for gas. the transmission fluid(measured hot and with the engine running) is not even showing on the dip stick, the belt cracked pretty bad, all the fluids are low there isn't a drop of washer fluid and who knows what else they didn't bother to check.

176,negative,"i called cottman transmission on the afternoon of 5/17/13 around 5pm to tell them that the issue was still there, and that at this point, it was ridiculous. andy, store manager, now no longer works at cottman? this is a new center manager, deborah ""debbie"" lee. i have to re-explain the entire saga on this date to her. meanwhile, she is having another conversation at the same time. i called her out on her lack of customer service and she explained she was trying to get parts from somewhere for another vehicle before they closed. i was irate and stressed the lack of customer service and concern that she was displaying. i told her what i was told about the transmission from cabarrus import on this day. she asked me to allow her to take a look at my car and see if she could help me. she told me she could read in the ""computer system"" that i had been dealing with this now for 3 months and getting nowhere. meanwhile, as a single mom, that works full time, i am borrowing cars, riding with co-workers and missing several appointments because of this continued car issue. i took the car back to cottman as debbie asked and she was finally able to determine the issue and get the blinking light to stop, although she never explained what they did, nor provided any type of receipt to me for this service? now believe it or not, the transmission was slipping in second gear. it was covered under warranty, so i called cottman, and debbie kindly told me to bring it in and she would get me fixed. she again apologized for all that i had been through with this car. the car was dropped off on 6/4/13 to again fix the transmission. when i spoke with her the next day, she explained that it needed a part and she had ordered it. she wanted to know if i wanted to pay $70 to have it overnighted. i couldn't believe that they were not willing to do so to get me my vehicle returned asap. i did not want to pay any more $ to get parts overnighted and was simply appalled that this company didn't either four months after the ""total rebuild"" of the transmission? the car stayed at cottman from 6/4/13- 7/10/13? i called every day, she explained over and over every excuse in the book as to why my car was not ready for pick up- that ""the parts ordered were wrong (cursing the part supply company out of ca and stating they were going to help with the car rental due to this), that they had rebuilt it again and tested it and it was still not fixed, that they could not figure out what was wrong and they were at a loss, that she hated my car, that maybe it was the year built and the parts, that she had never seen such an issue with a vehicle, that they were going to have a guy she knew who specialized in honda rebuilds to come and try to figure it out because maybe a fresh set of eyes could see it, that she would keep me informed, that she was doing the best she could."" i rented a car(for the 4th time since original rebuild on 2/4/13) on 6/20/13- two weeks and 2 days after i dropped it off because i had to have transportation at this point for work, due to the length of time it was taking for this national transmission company to repair my car for the 5th time in 4 months with no success. debbie explained that she was going to get approval to reimburse me for the parts i had bought that were most likely not needed, and for these car rentals. as requested by her, i had all of the receipts dropped off to her on 6/11/13 except for the last rental receipt (due to still having the rental car) so that she could get me reimbursed. i was pleased to hear that finally they were going to treat me like a customer that cottman had failed terribly. i spoke to debbie every day for the next 5 weeks to get an update on the car. i continued to ask her about getting reimbursed and if i should keep the rental car for another day, or weekend, etc. and she told me she was waiting on my last car rental receipt to discuss with her boss.i called her on 7/9/13 at 5pm and she told me it was not ready but ""should be in the morning."" i said i needed to call enterprise and let them know when i was bringing the car back. she reminded me to make sure they gave me the weekly rate of $185 that it was less expensive and that she had called them as well. i told her i would and that i would get a receipt for the final rental for her to have with all of the other receipts i had provided for reimbursement upon her request. on 7/10/13, i called her at 1:30pm, she said she had good news, that my car was ready. jokingly, she told me she could not wait to get rid of my car, that she hated it, and she never wanted to see it again. i went to drop the rental at 5:16pm, paid $653.79 for the rental, asked for my receipt and went to pick up my car at cottman with my final receipt for reimbursement. when i arrived, debbie informed me that she had spoken to the boss and that he, jodie, had agreed to give me an ""extended warranty on my rebuild and a $350 store credit?"""
177,negative,"i spent nearly $950 on a few hours work on my transmission at the end of may. still having issues one later. how can you change me almost a thousand dollars for a transmission tune-up on a 4 banger?! i just had to get it rebuilt by all state transmissions and they did a great job actually fixing my truck. 

i will never go back to sun devil auto unless to protest them. this is a company that deserves to fail because they will fail you."
178,negative,"dont waste your time trying to have your vehicle serviced here. brought my car there to check on a grinding noise. after a few days i was told the issue was some corrosion on the transmission, which my warranty wouldn't cover, paid about 200$. few days later i'm back there because the issue persisted and 2 more showed up. a whole week goes by and they can't 'duplicate' the issue. i come in for a road test with the manager 'mike', he hears the noises and i think 'great they'll know what to fix now'. get a call a couple days later telling me the tech can not hear the noises i had shown mike, to which i reply 'why did i waste my time coming in and driving with mike, why did he acknowledge the noises i was hearing'. already quite annoyed at this point. get another call saying the other noise is coming from the engine belt which needs lubricating which will cost 80$ to which i reply 'i can lubricate it myself no thanks' but i'm told 'the diagnosis alone will be 80$ anyway so they'll lubricate it and adjust the tension on the pulleys no extra charge. got the car back today and the noise is still there, fainter but still there which tells me no adjustments were done, they lubed it at most. but congratulations on ripping me off of 80$. regarding the other 2 noises, mike tells me they only hear them occasionally which is a lie, i hear it constantly, so they can't really fix anything until the problems get worse. i'm taking my car to a mechanic that's not completely worthless. save your money, don't come to old mill"
179,negative,"i had my transmission replaced at this facility on mcqueen/guadalupe, the first three days all my dash lights came on and i took it back in to have them check why, the manager comes out and tells me my car now needs a sensor in the wheel because it was broken.  i told him you all must have broken it, because nothing was wrong with my car except the transmission.  i was very upset, the mechanic came in and said the sensor was disconnected and i left.  the next couple of days my car was not running right and left me in a busy intersection.  the transmission had broken.  the owner kirk was not very nice he didn't want to rent me a rental car but did after all.  my car is still showing the lights on the dash board and he refuses to fix what they broke.  i am very disappointed being that now i have to spend more money to fix what they broke in the first place.  i will never use aamco again nor will i refer anyone to them."
180,negative,"if i could give no stars, i would! i should have read the reviews before i came in. this is the worst service i have ever experienced anywhere. i came here for the first time to get my check engine light diagnosis, ended up needing a gas cap. they called hours later to tell it was done, then called back to say they didn't even have the part and that nothing was done to it. so they ordered the part and said they wouldn't charge me today, which no kidding! so then they said they would deliver it to my work since i was down the street. i thought, ""oh wow, great service!"". i go out to my car when i get off work and my windshield was cracked like a big wishbone!! no one called tp tell me anything, the valet left all the trash in my car and service tag still hanging. i work at a dealership in the service department as well and this would never fly!!! my manager was even appalled they would even bring it back in that condition without notifying me before hand. then the service guy says, oh well we didn't charge you anything... well no kidding!! no one even cared to tell me anything truthful!! take the extra time and drive to autonation in tempe!!"
181,negative,"last month i took my 2005 navigator in with all new tires and rotors to have the alignment done. i specifically asked them to road test the vehicle as it also had a shake at 70mph.  i get the call that the work is done so i get the vehicle asked if it was road tested, they said yes should be fine. i take it off the lot to see how the alignment is and the steering wheel is off center by 2 inched meaning it's not centered it's out of whack. i immediately take it back and tell them this and its pulling worse than before to the right. the customer service person says ""oh it needs to settle on these older trucks."" well since i am having to drive to la it will give it plenty of time to settle. 

when i arrive back in las vegas nothing has changed it was a miserable trip because of this and i asked them to please correct it they said they would at no charge. now i also needed one spark plugged changed and the coil the #2 which can be hard to get at in this particular engine. they tell me leave the vehicle we will soak the plug overnight, so it will come out easy and not break we will change it and get your alignment done again. 

the next day i get a call telling me that the plug came out ok but its company policy to change all plugs not just one so its either all or non. i argue this as i just had the #7 changed and everything worked fine. the customer service guy (i am leaving names out to not be a total prick here) tells me its $600 bucks to change the one plug of $750 to change them all. i reluctantly tell him if it wont effect anything else in the engine then fine it only makes sense. he then tells me there might be some carbon in the engine after the change of all the plugs, so he will put a cleaning solution in and to run it through a tank of gas. then tells me we will see you tomorrow which i said no way you have had the truck one night already and have done nothing and i am spending $80 buck a day on uber please get it fixed. 

i return 30 min before closing to pick up the vehicle, i asked did you take it for a test ride they said yes. once i took the truck out of the parking lot the engine shakes like crazy and my odb indicated #2 cylinder to fail. i take it back right away and say what's going on the mechanic comes out and says i have no idea i will have to take it back into the shop tomorrow. so, i limp the truck back to my hotel to bring it back the next day to have them spend 5 min re securing the boot cover for the coil. in the mean time i check my dash cam video which records everything as soon as the truck is started to see there was no test drive ever. 

the truck it is running a little better but still has a shake in the engine and the oscillation does not sound correct at high revs. sure enough my check engine light comes on and says ""cam shaft bank #2 over retarded"" the timing is now out on the engine and it is driving like crap. i take it back again and the guy at the front tells me or well we can fix that but your looking at $2000 to $3000 to give you a heads up. i told him in 140,000 miles the timing has been perfect and whatever you did cause this issue. he said you want it fixed book it in. at this point i had to leave for my trip which i ended up driving 2000 miles on bad timing and now face having to fix this issue. 

at this point between lying about test drives and pushing me into extra services which they said would be beneficial to the engine and not take the timing out and do nothing about it i can not recommend this place to anyone. if you look at the positive reviews, they are mostly from females who got their oil changed. every other unhappy person is someone with real issues with their vehicle they never got solved or done poorly. 

i will be looking at my option in small claims court for these issues if not resolved."
182,negative,"update: if you have a vehicle with a cvt transmission, you need a transmission fluid flush every year!! i should have listened to coulter nissan. our car started to have issues with the transmission not too long after my initial review. my husband took it in to aamco and they told him the transmission was shot and that the transmission fluid was supposed to be flushed every year. so now i have a new hyundai (that does not have a cvt transmission ). your mechanics need to learn more about cvt transmissions before dispensing advice. i can tell you, i learned alot! a very expensive lesson!"
183,negative,"this place is worthless. i had a muffler installed last year and within days it was already leaking and within months the weld broke and i rode around for 6 months. they wouldnt fix it and when i tried to call them they had one excuse after another why they couldnt get me in. do not do any business with them. first of all they wont answer the phone, if they do they are full of excuses"
184,negative,"bought a red toyota tacoma xrunner form them next day

185,negative,"regrading my 2008 ford ranger sport.
july 2016: i received a recall notice on the passenger side airbag. i called ford service and was told that the airbag was back ordered and they would contact me when it arrived. i never heard back from ford and truth be told i forgot about the recall notice.

december 2017: i received a second recall notice on the passenger side airbag. i called ford service and spoke with an service writer named johnathan hanson and made an appointment for jan. 4, 2018 at 8:00 am over 2 weeks in advance.

jan. 4, 2018: arrived at ford service at 7:40 am. was going to wait for the repair and when asked how long it would take, i was told ""at least half a day"". i knew of an oil pan leak and had asked for an estimate to replace the oil pan gasket while they had the truck. i then left the vehicle and went home. 

12:10 pm: i received a call from mr. hanson, who went on to explain to me all the things that needed service on my 2008 ford ranger. it has 192,000 miles and after about 10 minutes on the phone with mr. hanson listing everything that needed service to the tune of $3,600, some of which were completely unfounded. ""i had a transmission leak, but they could not find the leak and would have to further investigate"". the plugs and wires needed to be replaced as they were ""saturated with oil"" and the cost was close to $500.00, among a laundry list of unnecessary repairs.  after mr. hanson finished explaining the service needs, i asked him if the truck was ready for pickup? he then explained to me that the airbag was on back order and he would call me when it came in. i questioned why the replacement airbag was not onsite prior to my arrival knowing i had made the appointment over 2 weeks ago? he stated that they had to verify the model of the airbag! really?

i happened to be out running errands when i received the call at 12:10 from mr. hanson, so i decided to drive to ford and speak with the service manager.

12:30 pm: i arrived at ford service and spoke with the service manager and asked how i was made to believe that ford was going to actually replace the airbag when they knew they didn't have it when i dropped the vehicle off that morning? he said ""he would look into it and get back to me as soon as possible.""

1:13 pm:  i received another call from mr. hanson who stated he was calling on behalf of the service manager, who ""was in a meeting"". he stated that they had located and airbag at another dealership and they could go and pick it up and have it installed and ready for pick up at 4:00 pm. i declined and and said i would pick the truck up at 3:00 pm as they had it for over 4 hours and was able to do a complete diagnostic on everything that was wrong with the truck, but they could drive to another dealership, pick up the airbag, drive back to the dealership and install it in less than 2 hours?

3:20 pm: i arrived at ford to pick the truck up and when i went to get the keys from mr. hanson, he stated ""it was all done"". i asked him what he meant and he said they replaced the airbag! i picked the keys and went to the truck and just being curious, i lifted the hood to inspect the ""saturated plugs and wires"" and saw no evidence of any saturation! i then went to request to speak to the dealership gm and explained the bad experience with him and asked how they were miraculously able to locate another airbag at another dealership, pick up the airbag, drive back to the dealership and install it in less than 2 hours when they had the truck all morning knowing that i was coming in over 2 weeks in advance? he apologized and was ""understanding of me being so upset"". the service manager happened to come in the gm's office during our conversation and when the gm asked the service how the mix up could have happened, the service manager made the sorry excuse of blaming mr. hanson as an inexperienced new hire.

as i was leaving, i told both the gm and the service manager ""that i hope they got a good look at my truck, as they would never see it in their dealership again"".

at the end of my conversation with the gm, it occurred to me this whole experience was nothing more than to try and milk me for $thousands$ of unnecessary repairs in hopes i would buy a new truck!!!

***update 1/26/18***
peoria ford quoted me @ 1,400.00 to replace the oil pan gasket. i took my truck to aaa auto repair for the repair of my known oil pan leak. i had the oil pan gasket replaced, the transmission flushed and the rear differential fluid changed. aaa charged me $818.69 total and as a aaa member i get a 2 year, 12,000 mile warranty on all repairs!!!

***update 4/19/18***
received another recall notice about the passenger side airbag from ford motor company yesterday. i verified the recall on safecar.gov. i then went to peoria ford this morning only to find out that the passenger side air was never replaced! apparently, they replaced the driver side airbag, which i have never received a recall notice on!!"
186,negative,"do not take your car here for repairs!! (i wish i could give zero stars) i was in an accident in april 2016 and i'm still hassling with them to get my car repaired back to 100%. it is now august 2016. i actually had to order a certain part myself after months of asking the status on said part. fed up, i finally ordered it myself and had it sent to the shop. weeks later no one had called me still about receiving the part. when i called they said they never got it. many phone calls later they magically found it somewhere in the shop. why did it take 4 months to get a part that i was able to get in a day?! their warranty is also bull****. if you come back to them with any issues on repair, they'll just say that it's not their fault and accuse you of doing it somehow and not remembering you did it. wtf?!?! save your sanity and go elsewhere. i regret the day i ever pulled into this shop."
187,negative,"thought this was going to be a five star kind of place. trust these guys with both of our vehicles, and our parents vehicle.  first issue noticed...dad took car in to rotate tires...not rotated and paid for it.  second issue...was told i needed 2 o2 sensors and a tune up to a tune of $1500.  we to my original mechanic and only had a small leak and was fixed under $300.  not sure they are totally qualified or trustworthy now."
188,negative,"you offered me compensation for one of many lies. 
tell you what, pay for the alternator that went out on me-powermaster 140amp, the installation of the high end pulley on it that can't be removed, ($400 est)
 a high quality (tci) reverse manual trans body. thats probably $350, transmission adjustment, and possible rebuild if it needs it ($100 probably but maybe more)
 a newer rebuilt 8 3/4 posi rear end or ford 9"" rear end ($700-$850) because this original    7 1/4"" rear end that came on the car in '67 and was built to handle 180 horsepower exploded on me. it was the original from 60 years ago and you left it on there and put posi on it?. who does that?  i don't know how it was done. intentionally or overlooked but it was a loaded grenade done by a man with no knowledge of performance vehicles or someone who wanted to make a fool out of some one. if it was the first guy, he would do what i'm asking below.

         just pay for a newer high quality drivetrain,(tci reverse manual valve body, tranny inspection and possible rebuild, rear end that can handle power, have it installed and my reviews disappear and i will be a 5 star slinging madman. or pay 1/2 man. you really got me and i'm asking for a little compensation. if you have any honesty in you you'll do something for me because i was handed a junkyard dart with a paint job, shift handle and posi. plus about the cheapest built small block crate motor you can buy."
189,negative,"consider finding another transmission repair shop if you need your vehicle fixed properly the first or even the second time and in a timely fashion. family member was out of state for extended period of time, so we volunteered to help pick up their vehicle after transmission repair. after over 3 weeks of being in for transmission rebuild,  picked up vehicle only to have problems the next day. would not go in reverse. took vehicle back to all pro. picked vehicle up again after a couple weeks, only to have a leak from transmission and given excuses for the leak. one more trip to all pro. after not hearing anything 3 weeks later, was told vehicle would be delivered to our house since we lived in west valley.  another week passed, no vehicle delivered, called and again told vehicle would be brought to house by tow truck or jim, himself, would personally drive vehicle to our house. tow truck dropped off vehicle, unfortunately while we weren't at home. came home to find vehicle would not start, dead battery. not a surprise since vehicle sat at repair shop for 5 weeks. now the waiting game to see if any additional transmission problems arise after driving vehicle"
190,negative,i made an appointment 14 days in advance to have my check engine light (po4e3) crankcase ventilation sensor taken care of and oil & filters changed and they didn't take care of the thing i waited 14 days to have done which was take care of the check engine issue. i could have taken it anywhere to have the oil changed in a matter of hours but i had to wait 14 days to get it done. they told me that i had to bring it back for the check engine light. the part that i had to leave it there for another day really upset me. when i went to pick up my truck and talked to fernando the service writer and expressed my concerns his body language told me he just wanted me to leave. he asked for my phone # and said he would have the service manager call me. i never did receive a call.
191,negative,"i was hopeful that this place would have honest mechanics being that many other places do not. we needed 4 things done,
tune up, oil change, check engine light was on and we need freon.
first went to auto zone for check engine light, they said we need a new gas cap. 
went here, tune up, oil change done, so we think. will have another mechanic see if the spark plugs are new. then came the estimates. 
check engine light is on because the canister behind the gas tank needs to be replaced..... $180.00. they need to replace the fan for the a/c in order to find out what is wrong.... $150.00. obviously we declined they're made up problems.
picked up the truck, put the new gas cap on, a few miles later the check engine light went off. unbelievable how these mechanics try to rip you off. thanks jimmy, we won't be back!!!"
192,negative,"i'm updating because when i thought my experience with pinnicale  nissan couldn't get worse it got a lot worse... i'll try to make it as short as possible even thought it's been total hell the last 8 months with them. i called them to see what my full balance for the car was before i made my first payment and found out they added on $800 the 3rd time i sign the papers knowing after sitting in there for 7 whole hours (on just one of the days i was there) i was tried and added it intentionally, these people are terrible and have no morals at all. that's not all. i also paid $2,000 for a 2 year warranty but they only gave me a 6 month warranty... are you kidding me? a 6 month warranty for $2,000? so i called to talk to jeremiah, saying it was arts fault but he quickly told me it was his fault and he knew he did it. i simply asked him why he wanted to screw me over and he repeated every time i asked ""well why'd you sign it?"" ""i sure wouldn't have."" i just wanted to know why but he couldn't tell me because they knew they did it and meant to. he repeated those words as least 10 to 12 times, no joke. this child of a man is the manager of the place. these are the people they have running this nissan location. which is the worse in arizona if not anywhere. so anna replays back to my first review saying she would help. i called to tell her they charged me for the car tint and tex paint that wasn't on the first contract but they deleted that contract so they could charge me more. i clearly didn't get the tint or any paint on my car so i told her since she ""want to resolve this problem."" if i get the things they charged me for they won't even have to take it off the payment and i'll drop it. but after fight with ana for 8 months she did nothing for me and told me i would never be happy so they couldn't help me. worst experience of my life and even after calling corporate  7 times nothing was done they could only suggest pinnacle nissan called me and fixed the problem but they never did and didn't care. if you want your problem fixed the only way is to call the bbb! i threatened them with it but they never did anything so i called and a 8 month nightmare was over in a week in a half after calling bbb. just call them and you'll most likely get what pinnacle nissan never planned to fix. they will also sell you cars that are rusted from the east and when your muffler breaks after only having the car a couple of months they will try to charge you 1,500 what a joke......
and these people that comment on these saying they are there to give ""top-notch service"" are full of it. i gave them pictures of text messages like they asked and everything else and i still had to call the bbb to force them to give me the money back they stole from me and not a penny more, nothing for the months horror with them. please pinnicale nissan... actually do what you say and you might have a chance to be a respected business one day(probably won't happen), people aren't all as stupid as you think."
193,negative,"time too find a new mechanic this rebel auto use too be great ..now they have these new services advisors .. it seems too me the new advisors keeps giving me the run around with my car ..why 4 ,5,6 ,7,8 times this transmission part out that transmission part is out they call me too authorize $490 too clean it then call me again a $700 too fix that part of the transmission then  call me again  too authorize a $1400 another problem with the transmission .. called me again they say i need a new transmission $2500 ...don't get why i kept getting the run around it seems too me this rebel auto don't know what they are doing any more when it's a big job like a transmission fix or major engine fix .. i say this company is out too take your hard earn money and lie about what needs too be done  u won't see me go there no more and i was one of yr best customers... before i know it rebel auto would be calling me up just for me too authorized a $50,000 dollars too fix my transmission  .. normally i get a car checked out they find the problem & fix it right away what a joke"
194,negative,the only thing honest about this place is they're honestly a rip off. i took my 2010 jaguar xf there for a simple oil change and to have my engine service light reset so i can get an emissions test. they charge me $180 for a full synthetic oil change! high-dollar filter that he didn't even know the name brand of. chris behind the counter was very friendly as he had no logical explanation for an oil change costing that much. chris told me that that was the only option for an oil filter $80 as i'm looking online and you can get a top-of-the-line fram for $25 they must have poured liquid gold in it for oil as i watch the tech pour in quaker state oil from an already used container. i took the car to another shop two days later and have the check engine light cleared for free and after the drive cycle i will be going to have emissions completed today. thanks chris for the best oil change money can buy!. needless to say i would never go near the shop again. 0 stars
195,negative,"this place is horrible.  my transmission started having shifting problems.  i did my research, and thought i knew what the problem was.  i figured it was a pressure sensor.  drove around this am looking for a reputable shop.  unfortunately, i ended up at this hole in the wall.  he starts telling me that my transmission doesn't have the sensor that i am referring to.  hah!  wrong!!  he tells me it's a mechanical problem.  i advise him that we pulled a switch to bypass the sensors, and it shifted.  he tells me that is only because we bypassed the tcm.  regardless, it shifted with the fuse pulled, so not likely mechanical!!  then he takes me out to the shop and shows my 5 pulled transmissions all lined up, and tells me that it happens often.  i laughed and told him he should not have showed this to me.  all it says is that he'd rather charged $1500 to rebuild a transmission on what should have been a $300-$400 repair.  i walked out.  took it to aamco.  $350 later and a new sensor and my jeep has got her shift grove back!!  avoid this place like the plague!!!"
196,negative,""" crooks"" stay away from these criminals. had my truck towed for transmission problems. they quoted me $4800 for a new transmission ( of course i needed a new transmission ) i called the ford dealer and over the phone they quoted me $3800 for a new transmission. i call wilhelm back and they said ""hmm that's strange"" so i told them not to touch my truck and they said well we already took it apart and charged me $380 for what they have already done. the new shop said it was never opened at all because it had the original dipstick plug in it from the factory. please do not go to this shop they will rip you off promise! buyer beware."
197,negative,"our day started with the van being an half hour late for pick up, when it did arrive the driver was very rude to the people in front of us who started to board the van before he got to the door. once inside the van the air wasn't on and when asked to put it on he snapped it on with attitude like we where bothering him. there was no stop at the las vegas sign or tour of vegas at all. we arrived at the terminal and where given our tickets and arm bands and onto the big bus. this driver was great he gave lots of good info on our drive to hoover dam. after our tour of hoover dam  things again started to go downhill, we had people that did not come back to the bus on time and that held everyone up. this is when we also found out that the driver had another assignment at 4 so things need to get going. then it was off to lunch where again we where held up as the people getting helicopter tours where late getting back. then we went to the chocolate factory and catus garden for a quick 20 min stop. then we found out we had to change buses because of his assignment at 4. so at 3.30 we changed buses, as soon as the new bus pulled out of the luxor hotel there was a loud clunk and we had no transmission. after waiting for an half hour many of us decided to find our own way home. my  boyfriend and i knew that if we got to caesar's palace we could grab a shuttle to trump tower. so on we embarked on a 30 min walk to caesar's palace. to say i am very disappointed is an understatement, i  tried twice to contact the company on this matter but a week later they still haven't gotten back to me. what was planned to be a stress free 8 hour tour ended up being very stressful and when you figure we left the main building at 10 and was back in vegas at 3:30 wasn't even close to the planed 8 hour trip."
198,negative,"so after calling around trying to find a shop to rebuild my transmission i decided  to go here because they quoted me $1295 and an additional $300 if my servo pack was bad which was in line with what other shops had quoted but they offered a 3yr warranty.  after they towed it in and took it apart they called me and told me it would be $3400. so i went in to see why. well because they are scam artests! i was told the discoloration on my torque converter from where it was factory welded was because it got hot, that the grease smudge on my pump was discoloration and it was bad also, and that one of the servos had damaged my case and it was also bad. after arguing about the price they told me they could fix the case and it would be $2800. the case needing to be fixed is standard in a rebuild for a 5r55s, the standard rebuild kit comes with the parts to rebuild the pump, and a torque convertor is standard  with any reputable rebuild. i mentioned getting a used transmission the shop foreman tried to tell me there was a $350 charge to flash the computer to the car. totally  unnecessary.  so after calling around i found another shop that would do it all for $1650 and told them that. they told me it was $405 to get my car back and they would just do it all for $2000 so i didn't have to take it somewhere else. at that point i didn't want them to touch my car. i don't trust them with an oil change. i have a pending dispute with the better business bureau hopefully i can get my money back. but i would recommend anybody and everybody to stay far away from this shop. i'm willing to bet the good reviews on here are from friends and family. also i asked to speak to the management and was taken to the office to speak to the formans wife.  that was pointless. i hope this shop gets shut down with there predatory practices. they will get you in the shop and then run up the bill hoping you don't know any better. it's a $405 mistake i won't forget."
199,negative,"don't bother making appointments online, arrived for my appointment and i had to wait 3 hours for an oil change! after it was all done i was told i had a transmission leak. which they showed me and their was a leak. and quoted me $1,000 to fix, (not the first time they do this to me) i took my car to my mechanic for a second opinion and said theirs oil in pan because they spilled oil all over. smh! 

moral of story. if you're a woman they will take advantage of you."
200,negative,"i had the worst experience ever with extreme extensions. after i met her where she was 20 minutes late for the appointment we decided a date to get the extensions and on the day off she said her car won't start so she sent me to the girls home. it was in the basement, the girls did a really bad job it was so dirty the needle that she use did not look safe. i was very disappointed i came back and told juliana about my experience and i told her i also wanted to add some more hair.  she did not honour the promise of 30 day guarantee for the hair and neither did she give me a receipt for the transaction. everything was on email and she promised me to give me a receipt... but then she stopped answering my calls and messages. it's not legal for any business to not give receipts if they've charged taxes. when i complained about the hair she said i have fired the girl you can do what you want. but you can call her and talk to her. i said but i paid you and she was your employee she won't answer my calls. juliana did not care. i have all this in my text messages.  i really do not recommend her to anyone do not use the services.  they are clear scam i lost money you guys don't do that ."
201,negative,"this guy ken is a crook!!! he charged me $3000 to put a junk yard transmission in my car. i drove it 2 days and it would shift. had it towed back over and ken wasn't nearly as nice this time. told me the trans would need rebuilt !!!! wtf i thought i paid you to rebuild it i guess not, i paid $3000 to get a used transmission from the junk yard installed!!!!! the guy in the shop told me that's normal..? needless to say 3 weeks later my car came back to me with another junkyard transmission. how can be a legitimate transmission shop when you can't rebuild a transmission!!!!! beware  before you take your car to this guy ken!"
202,negative,"if i could give this place negative stars, i would. i have had my fiat for just about two years now. i got it brand new off the lot. one day my check engine light comes on and i take it in to get it looked at by mark. he said nothing was wrong with my car and sent me on my way. a week later it comes on again & this time my car is having trouble starting. so when i take it in again he has some bulls*** excuse like there's dust (blah blah blah). a week later it comes on again & this time my battery dies in a parking garage and i have to get it jumped. they replace the battery and say ""okay now everything is fine"". now, fast forward to today, in total i have been here 5 times in the last month and a half. my car is not being fixed & they don't know what they are doing. my check engine light has come on again and my car never starts on the first try. i called the manager about the situation and he never called me back. they are not wanting to help me and this car is hazardous. i have broke down again a few days ago and when i asked to get my car looked at they are too busy. this is a horrible company that does not care about you after you buy your car. i have still not been contacted by any manager. it is making me want to go to corporate."
203,negative,"terrible company overall. the only good news: so far, on day 5 from getting my car back, transmission seems to be fixed. i am one to hardly ever complain, however, the 4 weeks that my car was at cofc was a disaster. during the first two weeks of my car being there, and some poor communication on where my car stood in getting completed, we were given several stories of parts being lost, ""drilled into wrong"", angry employees leaving and possibly ""sabotaging"" parts, an employee ""leaving on his deathbed due to cancer"", and day after day being told ""it will only be another day or two"" until it was ready. we lost faith after the first two weeks with this local shop, only for the nonsense to continue with the gm-mr. jody preston when we brought our concerns and wanted a significant discount. needless to say once we shared our concerns, we were laughed at when asking for a discount, made to feel ignorant and even were bullied when gm declared that he was ""wondering if we even had the money to pay to get the car back"". during the last conversation we had with gm he hung up on us blatantly making us aware that this company and owner, fred bowen do not care for its customers. after a lot of work was done on our end, the only discount that the gm and customer service rep agreed upon was to reimburse for half of the rental car rate we ensued. customer service rep listened to our concerns over 45 minutes and agreed that our ""story sounds terrible and just bad"", however the final say was up to the gm and the owner ""will probably back up his gms"". i highly recommend not using this shop for your car care needs."
204,negative,"re: chapman hyundai on 9th ave bell rd. in phoenix.  i give you zero stars and i truly hope someone there will take this to heart.  i am also writing a complaint to hyundai executive corp at 10550 talbert ave. fountain valley ca 92708.  on july 4,2006, i bought an 07 entourage (minivan), by 2009 the check engine light was on all the time.  i had the van in several times for some small warranty covered repairs and some big repairs not covered by that ""fabulous"" warranty.  every time it was in the chapman hyundai service station, i asked for the for the engine light to be checked.  the last time i was there 1 1/2 to 2 yrs ago for a big costly repair, i was told that entourages have the check engine light sensory problem by a lady who worked there and picked me up in the service entourage and her check engine light was on.
now, it's time for my entourage to go in for emissions.  on the az mvd website it states the #1 thing that will fail your vehicle is the check engine light being on.   i went online and searched hyundai entourage and check engine lights.  tons of negative reviews about this.   while on the chapman hyundai website, a chat box came up and i asked about fixing this problem.  the rep scheduled me an appointment at 2pm on tuesday 6/24.  i asked if there was going to be a cost because there shouldn't be ( i asked to have this fixed too many times under warranty), the rep said she would check and get back in touch with me...days went by and no response. i got an email confirming my appointment but didn't say with who.  i went at my appointment time, no one acknowledged me even though all the employees were there and i was the only customer.  i had to bang my keys on the counter to get some one to even look at me. by this time, it's 2:09.  the service coordinator jaime, who assisted me the past 2xs i was there and i specifically told her about the check engine light came in to asked how she could help.  at that time i realized there was no communication between the chat assistance, the email rep and the service dept.  none. i once again told jaime the engine light was on and i need to go to emissions and i will fail.  she had the balls to tell me it was going to cost $85 to diagnose the problem.  i said to unhook it or turn it off so i can pass emissions.  for 5  years they told me it wasn't a problem but now my warranty is over and i have to pay.  they blew it off for 5 years and now want my money.   i turned around and walked away.  the sunday before, my parents and their neighbors were talking about buying a new car, the neighbor was interested in a hyundai, i called her when i got back into my entourage and told my experience and suggested neither one go to chapman hyundai or even buy a hyundai at all.  they were tossing back and forth a hyundai or toyota.  i hope i swayed both sales. and in the next year, i'm going to need a new vehicle that just stopped me from being a return customer. 5 years of ignoring me.  just because i am a little female, does not mean i don't have a big freaking voice.  i am mad."
205,negative,"firestone decided to give me a late response and solved nothing. so here's a repost. 

i went into the firestone on rock springs to get a simple promotion. it was a special on an oil change that gave a discount on new wiper blades as well. i had been to firestone before to replace some times and a few oil changes beforehand so i figured things would go fine. after my oil change, i noticed a rather bad oil leak in my car. so i brought it back in. i was told that this oil leak is just a coincidence since i had an older car (1998 honda accord) and a lot of the parts were old. what firestone didn't know was that i bought this car from a mechanic who replaced a good amount of things under the hood. it's not a coincidence. deciding to place some trust in them, i agreed to have dye added into my car to find out just where this leak was coming from. i also asked if the drain bolt was secured and was told yes, no issues. after waiting the 5-7 days as requested to, i brought the car back in. apparently there were multiple leaks and i needed to replace the oil pan, coolant and crank system, the transmission and all this other stuff that would add up to $2600. i already felt like i was getting the run-around. out of the two visits i asked if the drain bolt was fine and was told yes, no issue. also told my tire pressure was good (which later at another shop was told differently). i took my car to another shop called zenith auto and immediately, they noticed oil leaking at the the oil drain plug and replaced the drain plug crush washer. it was $31 to replace that piece and stop the leak. i went back to firestone and confronted them about this. immediately i was given a refund (which to me means they knew they messed up.) but never did henry, the man i spoke to 3 times, admitted fault. i asked if the washer was normally replaced during an oil change and he told me only if it has to. i didn't buy that answer so i called two other firestones in the area and both told me they would replace the washer when doing the oil change. i was lied to. multiple times. henry, and firestone, have no integrity. i wasted 2 weeks with them to find out such a simple thing had gone wrong. if they just admitted that they messed up, i would have been alright but no.. henry continued to lie to my face about the issue. 

and of course, the claims specialist who i have been talking to takes 4-5 days to respond to me. i had to take all action on my own. 

by far one of the worst experiences i ever had anywhere and i would not recommend anyone to go here for any type of service unless they feel like getting lied to or swindled.

yea..."
206,negative,"i've been using this midas shop for over 3 years without a problem.   they  always been up front with me explaining whats wrong and fixing whatever problem quickly and reliably.  
over the summer i had my car towed to the shop with engine problems.   it took them four days to diagnose, and told me i needed new spark plugs.  they had my car for 5 days just to replace the plugs and get my the engine codes to clear so my check engine light would stay off.
easy fix i thought.   two days after the fix the car was still having issues, so i replaced the coil packs and plug wires myself.   this seemed to fixed my problem with only an occasional engine hiccup which i was comfortable with owning a high mileage older vehicle.
i brought my car in for emission testing and it showed an engine code failure. the technician thought it was strange since my check engine light wasn't on so he ran the test again and told me that the bulb was probably burned out. once again older car, i can see that happening.
decided to bring my car to another shop on recommendation to fix the problem, and upon removing the instrument cluster to change the engine light bulb, there was no bulb.    the tech at midas removed the check engine light bulb so i it would seem like my car was fixed.
they just lost all my business.    sorry tony."
207,negative,"i recently had my oil changed at auto tech.  i was hopeful with all the great reviews on here, but my experience was very disappointing.  here's my top 3 reasons why i don't like this auto shop:

1.  not  honest
2.  not  accurate
3.  not  professional

they weren't honest with me, because after my oil change they said i needed a new air filter & all my fluids ""washed out""  (fluid for transmission, power steering, brakes, etc).... and they estimated the cost of that would be $300+

as a young woman, i know that some repair shops take advantage of people... so i told auto tech that i would consider the repairs, but won't do it today.  so i went to auto zone to buy a new air filter (they'll install it for free), and when the auto zone employee removed my old air filter he said it looked brand new!  he showed it to me, and the only dirt on it was from the filthy finger prints that the auto tech mechanic put on my air filter!!!  then he checked all my fluids and said they look perfectly fine, so the $300+ fluid wash out that auto tech recommended was completely unnecessary!!  i'm so glad that i got a second opinion!

with accuracy.... auto tech wasn't accurate in something as simple as their bookkeeping.  they record your car's mileage, and they wrote down 4,000 miles more than what i actually have!  it's a simple error, but it just shows how this auto shop doesn't pay attention to details.

i don't think auto tech is very professional either, because as i was waiting in the lobby for my car's oil change, i could hear the mechanics talking very loudly about offensive crude topics.  i don't care what mechanics or anyone else wants to talk about on their own time, but they should be aware of this when it's within earshot of customers.  also, i know that some women may be offended by the way the manager calls customers ""sweetie"".  personally, i'm neutral about it, but i know some women see it as disrespectful when they should be saying ""ma'am"" instead.

overall, auto tech is encouraging customers to have unnecessary repairs done, and their mechanics are filthy with how they handle your car's parts.  my air filter not only had dirty finger prints from their mechanic... also, auto tech didn't put the air filter back into my car correctly!  there's a clip that holds it in, and they didn't secure it.  that's careless work - unacceptable."
208,negative,"i was having issues with my 2013 nissan altima, it was driving strange and stalling at times. i brought my car to the service department for an inspection and was told the issue was with my transmission that would need to be completely replaced for $5,000!!!!! joey in service told me based on the condition of the transmission and fluid he is not surprised this happened as i did not properly maintain my vehicle. i quickly began to research this as my car has 70,000 miles!!! i work for a car rental company and more than understand the importance of maintaining the condition of a vehicle. i was shocked to hear this and disturbed at the way joey presented the news to me. 

i quickly began to research and found people all over the country that have been having this issue on all types of nissan products, even after replacing the fluid. also, nissan is well aware of these situations but it does not seem to be a priority for them to assist their customers. i did call and file a case with nissan customer care. after almost 2 weeks of paying for a rental car, while my car sat at the service center, i got a call from customer care today. they have offered some financial assistance with the repairs but again no explanation of how this problem happened in the first place. my car is less than 5 years old with 71,000 miles! nissan is ok with selling vehicles to people knowing the transmissions are not built to last the life of the vehicle. that is unacceptable. 

today i spoke with joey in service to discuss the final prices of repairs so i could decide if would be able to afford my portion. when i called he told me he was confused by the entire situation, quoted me a different price for repairs and when i tried to ask more questions he dismissed me telling me ""not to worry about that right now"". when i tried to explain what nissan customer care had told me he would interrupt and tell me that ""he will get paid either way and he is not worried."" he told me this about 3 times before i explained my frustration that no one seems to care about what i have to pay for something that should not have happened in the first place. after dealing with this situation i am going right to the corporate fleet department of my company to inform them they should reconsider their relationship with nissan all together. 

i can not even continue to explain the amount of stress and pure anxiety this situation has caused and how disrespectful and dismissive the service representatives have been. i will never purchase another nissan vehicle again and will advise others to do the same."
209,negative,"you'd better shop around.  i initially went there for an inspection but didn't have the registration yet.  he hunted around for a little while before giving up.  maybe they're normally exorbitant, but i have been to several other excellent garages who charge 20/tire to mount, balance and rotate tires.  this garage will charge you about 37/tire claiming they will change out valves clean the rim, mount, balance rotate blah blah etc.  when i got there to pick up the car they said they didn't change the valves because i had tpms.  basically they're charging an extra 17/tire to ""clean"" and prepare the tire for mounting.  i don't see the value in that.  god forbid i actually went there for my an inspection.  on a positive note he did give me a price of the service in advance and my schedule didn't permit me to make another appointment around better garages schedules."
210,negative,"i have to caution anybody going to vette culture in hopes of saving you the money and the bad experience that i had to suffer. i spent a fortune there rebuilding and upgrading my engine on a corvette z06 and ended up having to pay another shop another small fortune to fix all the problems they caused my car. they told me they stood by their work, but when it came time to fix their mistakes (which were significant and many) they were very rude and told me to go to another shop, they won't fix any of it under warranty or i could pay them again for the same job. keep in mind this was not long after the original work, some issues the day i got the car back and the rest in less than 1200 miles. 

 i bought a corvette from a buddy of mine that vette culture had done some modifications on. i went back to vette culture to have them do a major engine rebuild and upgrade. to make a long story short it's been one problem after the other from the time i dropped it off til now. i spent a small fortune trying to have the car built to be able to race when i want, and daily drive when i want. the owner and his service tech made me many assurances that the car was going to be built well and they stand behind their work. 

when you see ******** that means the long version is ahead..... and it's bad and it's dramatic and it's very expensive.

the issues: 1-time. they said it'd take about a month. it took over 3 months
                       2- surprise charges.  a couple thousand dollars more than we agreed
                       3- the car ran like garbage for unless warmed up for several minutes
                       4- massive overheating after assuring me the $800 radiator would be enough
                       5- the car failed to start regularly until i pushed the start button multiple times
                       6- major oil leaks after less than 500 miles
******************7- standard oil change. way overfilled the oil and made a huge mess for me.
the ""solutions"" from vette culture
                      1- it was the machine shops fault it took so long. had nothing to do with us
                      2- they split the charges with me so i was only out an extra thousand bucks
  *************** 3- ""that's just the way it is now that you have a built motor""**************  
   ***************4- ""we can try to fix it, order these parts and we'll try it out""***************
*****************5-""its just the fuel pump needs to prime more, can you live with it?********
*****************6- lied to me or misdiagnosed a ""brake fluid"" leak with a $1500 quote to fix it

i ended up going to a real performance shop with actual skilled techs and paid them to fix all of vette cultures screw ups. 

long stories made short for 7,3,4,5, and 6 issues.
7-oil change botch- the tech had just learned about all the mistakes he made and then had to change my oil. i was leaking oil all over my garage when i got home and called and told him. (no joke) he told me he must have over filled it and told me to simply disconnect my methanol injector, disassemble the air intake manifold, pop off the filter and clean it in my back yard. he didn't have time to put it back on the lift. either a: he purposefully made a huge mess for me or was under qualified to change my oil. you decide
3 i paid another company to dyno and retune it. they found a dead map sensor and whats worse is that the computer factory warning and check engine light had been manually turned off to hide it. after another $1200, it runs great right on start up.
4. heating issue- they didn't have the parts when i showed up for the appointment and wouldn't return my calls . luckily, this is why i found the other shop. 
5 non starting- they put in a bad meth kit that was leaking into my engine and flooding it.  tons of $$$ later..... it starts fine now.
6 the same under qualified tech told me the oil leak was actually brake fluid from my master cylinder for my clutch and gave me a $1500 estimate to fix. i had 2 other shops check it out and both confirmed it was oil leaking from my rear main seal and my timing cover gasket (both were brand new from the build) i told the owner what was going on, and got them to agree it was in fact oil from these spots. but once i told them i had to waste more money at the other shop to cover their mistakes and reminded them of their promise to stand behind their work, they told me, ""go to your new shop if you like them so much, or pay us again, i'm not fixing anything under warranty now"" i took their dirty looks as i walked out the door. i emailed the owner a longer story of how his tech botched everything and how i tried to give them the opportunity to fix it first. he left me a voice mail saying he didn't know all of that and wanted to talk more about it. hoping he'd make it righ i called back twice, but that was over a week ago. he must have changed his mind and now i'm forced to write this review. i really wish i never would have stepped foot in there."
211,negative,"so rude! i was just down there tonight needing them to hook up my car to their little computer so i could get the code for my check engine light...takes literally less than a minute. i stood there and stood there while 2 mechanics just completely ignored me. i finally spoke up and asked if they could get me the code for my check engine light and one of the guys said i would have to go inside. there was an older man with long, white scraggly hair inside and i said i just need to get the codes for my check engine light. he looked at me like i was crazy and said ""we can't do it tonight, we're swamped."" i was like ""you can't take a minute to pull the codes for me?"" he said ""no, you can bring it back in the morning."" i said ""uh no"" and walked out. unbelievable! and it was just the way he talked so rude to me. i went down the street to another mechanic who actually looked busier than pep boys and i was in and out in about 3 minutes. welp, i won't be returning to pep boys with my business and i will tell my mom and son to do the same. but i guess by the way i was treated they obviously aren't worried about keeping customers."
212,negative,"took our car in today for a smog check. the car was running so mileage could be checked & documented. there is a dummy light on ""check engine"". hooked up to scope got the diagnostic code and what that specific code means. the car failed. which they knew it would fail given the "" check engine light"" was on. so knowing it would fail at the 1st step of checking mileage, given the check engine msg. was on. they proceded with hooking it up to the scope. charged us $28.00. once we get the code fixed, they do not give you a credit to run through the system again. if we were to go back to them they would charge us the full fee of $28.00. unfortunately, we went through this same problem with them a while back different vehicle. our bad for not remembering this. we really feel cheated. remember to check your dummy lights before getting smog certification performed. if you have an error message go to an automotive repair shop to resolve first. this is very frustrating! feel cheated. obviously, not a customer service shop."
213,negative,will never use again! we had been a loyal customer for years. our latest experience is our last. we brought a car in that was shifting poorly. they said the transmission was bad so they put in a used one. they put it in and said that it was worse than the first one. so they put another transmission in and then said that this 3rd transmission was bad as well. then they said they could not work on the car anymore because they were not making enough money on it (the labor was $1000 and the used transmission was $450). the car was at budget transmission for over 60 days. i took it to another transmission place and they replaced the transmission computer and it works fine (this cost $325). so budget transmission cost me $1775 for a $325 fix! and had me without a car for over 60 days.
214,negative,the owner here is so cheap! they pretend to hire you and make you work but never pay you! the place is nasty and the people gossip about each patients. devices are not sterile also that causes transmission of infection. i don't recommend this place to anyone.
215,negative,"i took my ford edge in for a simple oil change. about 10 minutes into the appointment, one of the technicians came out to present me with two ""recommended services"" that i should take care of soon. i typically just wave off the recommended services until i've had time to research and investigate. i told him i would call back for an appointment.

well, one of the ""recommended"" services was an auto transmission flush ($195). i didn't think anything of it at the time when it was suggested. however, after the appointment i began to remember that i'd just had a 60k mile vehicle service a few months back and i felt as though the transmission had been flushed as part of that appointment. i found and reviewed my paperwork from that appointment. lo and behold, the transmission had been flushed (this according to the paperwork).

so, my dilemma was this:  either the previous auto shop lied or ford is lying. i summarily popped my hood (the engine had been sitting all day) and checked the dipstick. to my surprise and disappoinment, the fluid actually looked like i could lick it! not that i would, of course...but it was just that pink, as though it was just flushed (and not five months earlier).
my disappointment was more out of the fact that huntersville ford is about 3 minutes from my job. i could make an appointment, sit there and work (free wi-fi) while the work was being done.

needless to say, i will never return to this dealership. i wanted to make sure and provide this information, to remind everyone...always research and investigate when dealing with auto technicians. there is a saying that goes, ""trust, but verify"".  i guess when it comes to dealership auto shops... perhaps that should be tweaked a bit to, ""don't trust and verify""."
216,negative,"absolutely hate this place. i am not one to review places often but i hope this helps someone not be in the same situation as me. i took my car a 2013 ford focus. in for a recall check on 1/5/2019. michael quntion was my service advisor that was taking care of me. he told me it would take a few hours and that he would call me well he did. that is about the only thing he did right. he left me a message saying that my car did not pass the recall inspection and it was not safe to take my car and that ford is not covering rentals up front that i have to call the customer service number and get an approval. there was no eta on when there was going to be a part shipped as it was a big recall......a deformed gas tank. first thing monday morning i did call customer service. they gave me a case number and told me to give it to the service advisor and that it is his job to put the extensions in. well, i called mike and got no answer so i left a message with the info and he called me back left a message and told me that the rental was good to go he just needed to know when i was going to pick it up.
i get to enterprise to pick up the car and gentleman that got me checked in said i had to be put in the same type of car i have and that it was covered till the 12th of january i asked what happens if they don't have the part in by then and they said that it is up to the dealership to take care of that they never have any problems with this. well, the 12th came and i tried calling mike no answer left a message never got a call back. called enterprise and they told me they sent him a message as well and haven't gotten a response. i called again on the 13th to enterprise and the lady i spoke with said not to worry just keep checking in.  i tried calling him once or twice a week and never got a response and neither did enterprise.
january 25th comes and he finally calls me and leave a message saying it should be about another 2 weeks before the part is in and just wanted to keep me updated, didn't mention anything about the rental.
well then on february 11, 2019 (36 days that i had the rental) mike calls me and says that my car will be ready the next day and btw we are not covering the rental. he told me to reach out to customer service and get an authorization code. i called that number and they told me that is something the dealership has to request that the only thing that they can give me is the case number in which i have. they ended up giving me a number to an area manager (katherine) who started to get papers together to get a case submitted for them to pay it. she started on that february 11 and told me several time that mike was not returning calls or emails. she asked him for several documents and he never sent them over until she reached out to his manager. then when he did get them over they were the wrong thing and missing key parts. 
when i went to get my car on the 12th mike was already gone that day! katherine did not get the case submitted until the 20th because how long it took to get the info which was still wrong. the rental invoice showed i was in a mazda. i have the agreement in my email and she refused to let me get that for her and refused to call enterprise to get something that will work. 
she called me on the 21st and told me that they denied it because the invoice issue, that i already took the car that it should have been submitted before i picked up my car, and that there were no pictures showing it was unsafe to drive my car. she told me that the gm pat hickey was going to call me and i still have not received a call and it has been 6 hours so far. very upset that i am stuck with a bill of 1200+ because mike didn't do his job from the get go. my father worked in a ford dealership for 9 years and said that the way this was handled was wrong and does not follow policy and procedures. will be taking this to court because that is a huge debt i cannot afford at this moment. i think it is funny how months leading up to this they called me 2 -3 times a week trying to let them buy my car back...as it is part of the transmission lawsuit already."
217,negative,"look in photos to see the two i posted about my experience. i got charged $267 for them to plug in my car, and tell me why my check engine light was on. then, it was going to be $700 more to replace the part. i look online and the part is $140 and i call the dealership, they sell it for $260. i went to auto zone and get a 2nd opinion, and they charged me nothing to tell me the same thing. my pump needed to be changed. these guys are frauds. stay away.

----just responding to matts comment. isn't true that if i got it fixed at the dealership it would have been for the same or a little higher. i got the part for $190 at the dealership and they only charge $100 to diagnose/test which you charged $260 for. my complaint was never that you aren't cheapest, it just seems you are way over priced. we can agree to disagree. myself, my family and friends just spread the word not to go to your shop"
218,negative,"if i could give zero i would. this is by far the worst dealership i have ever dealt with. i finally decided to drive ford after loving my 2010 f150 work truck. i did research and met with multiple dealerships before choosing for berge to buy a new 2011 f150 ecoboost. i absolutely loved this truck for about 6 months before issues began to arise. first, the circuit board made popping sounds and the sync went out. after that the speakers went out again. for a third time the speakers needed replacement. all of these issues weren't major and covered under warranty, but it was a hassle to get it in and wait a few days for completion. then at 32k miles the transmission felt like it was slipping and the rear end was making a clunking sound. i brought it in again to find the entire transmission needed to be replaced. this was a two week job and no service vehicle was offered even when asked for. after the two weeks, i drove it for a few days and still felt the rear end clunking, this time more often and started grinding. i took it back in to find they didn't catch that the entire rear end needed to be rebuilt. there were metal shavings all over within differential and fluids and seals were failing. again they spend 5 days on the fix without a rental because they didn't think the job would take more than a day. after this whole ordeal i gave up on this truck and wanted to trade out. the offer? 4k less than blue book and no concessions for the lemon of a truck they sold. they have been nothing but rude since i purchased the vehicle due to issues and wouldn't stand by their product. i would avoid this dealership and never spend your hard earned money there. go somewhere where they respect a customer and stand by there products. i would recommend anything but ford here on out!"
219,negative,"i wish i could give a 0! i'm out $1,200 and my car wasn't fixed!

i took my car here to be fixed based on a recommendation as we are new to the area. as soon as i drove my car out of the parking lot after ""being fixed,"" there was a new sound. i asked them about it and they said not to worry, but to bring it back in when it got louder. 

what do you think happened? yep, the noise got louder, so i took it back in. they had my car for a day, then said that there was nothing wrong with my car. fast forward a couple of months, i'm driving on the freeway and there's a loud sound and then the check engine light came on. 

at this point, i decided to take my vehicle somewhere else to be fixed as i've now been to stamps 3 different times. the other mechanic did such a great job and haven't had any issues. 

i decided that i would call stamps to see about some sort of refund/store credit. the ""gentleman"" who i spoke to...who has been a mechanic for more than 20 years...and apparently hasn't ever interacted with a customer basically told me i was stupid.

i then spoke to the gm who told me basically that i should have brought my vehicle back into them to get it fixed...um, no thanks. i gave you 3 chances...paid $1,200 for nothing. 

use them at your own risk!"
220,negative,let me just start by saying the entire process has been a complete and total disaster. we starting talking to a representative via the phone on thursday about the jeep we wanted to purchase. ran numbers and got everything approve and he assured us it would be ready to go on saturday which was when we wanted to purchase it by. friday came and the sales representative told us we needed to put a $100 advance payment down in order to hold the jeep until we could get in on saturday. saturday came and the car wasn't ready due to a check engine light being on and they needed to order the part. sales rep told us it would be ready monday and after my husband got out of class he drove all the way down there and was told it was being detailed and would be ready to go before we finished paperwork. yet another lie. finished paperwork and drove all the way home with no jeep. promised to deliver it to us the next day by a set time. texted our sales rep at that time and they hadn't even finished detailing it. jeep ended up being delivered to us 3 hours late. we immediately reached out to the sales man because the air condition was making a terrible noise. he said that wasn't covered under warranty and that was now our problem. ended up costing me over $100 to fix it. a few days later the oil change light came on so i checked to verify when the oil was last changed because we were told it was done right before delivery. sale man said he didn't know when it was last changed because it was done before they received the car in. i thought no big deal it's only $30.00 i can change it. a few days later i went to lay on the horn to cuss someone out for turning without using a turn signal and learned that my horn didn't work. it sounded when you locked the jeep so we didn't think anything of it. texting the sales rep and got no reply. waited two days and ended up reaching out to the sales manager and explaining everything that was going on. he made an appointment for me to come get it fixed. i drive two hours there with traffic and sit for 3.5 hours only for them to tell me they have to order the part and it will be in later today. i thought no problem i can shop for a couple hours. 5:45 comes and the sales man calls me and tells me the part didn't come in and won't be in til monday at the earliest and that if the mechanic that was working on it wasn't in i would be waiting even longer. so now after waiting all day i  had to drive back home and sit in 5 o'clock traffic forever. let's not forget that i then have to drive back another two hours on monday for them to waste yet another one of my very few days off. i don't feel like this dealership cares about it's customers or values their time. once my horn is fixed i will never buy anything there again. if anything else goes wrong i'll be paying someone else to fix it just to spare me the headache of dealing with them.
221,negative,"i'm louisa m's husband and her story is about my car.  

to be honest, what upset me about this experience was not that i caught a guy sleeping in my car. i felt that the service department was upset about it and that they handled it well from a customer relations point of view. i'm also satisfied (so far) with the work performed on my vehicle (replacing the transmission and rear brake pads). a few weeks later, all seems to be going well with those repairs.

what does upset me, however, is the service department's failure / refusal to take responsibility for an issue they obviously caused when they did the other repairs. specifically, the a/c on my vehicle is no longer performing correctly (and we're going into summer!!!). this issue was not a problem for me when i dropped it off. but it's a problem now. meaning that something they did caused the issue.

manufacturer says that this is a known issue that can happen when ""the feedback actuators for the air temperature voltage are out of range."" service department says they could not have caused that to happen and want me to pay another $1,000 (after paying $5,300 for the other work) to get this fixed.

so replacing the transmission meant they had to disconnect and reconnect the electrical system. i know they did this because my clock was messed up when i got the car back. seems like that kind of thing could easily cause voltage issues with the climate control, but they insist that their work could not have possibly caused the issue. 

so i'm disappointed to say that i have to give this business a bad rating. a service-based business lacking accountability is not one you should give your business to."
222,negative,"having your car worked on is like a doctor's exam. it's almost never pleasant...and this particular visit was what i believe my first prostate exam is going to be like.

i learned a valuable lesson. never get your smog checked at a place that wants to sell you other services and repairs. go to the little sheds where all they want to do is collect your $25 and get back on break.

i didn't realize my check engine light was on...they checked my smog for $18 then told me i failed because my check engine light was on, then told me there was no emission problem, but it wouldn't pass with the check engine light on....................
here again: ""really......reallyyyy?""

i asked when i arrived how long on a smog check they said ""no wait.""
15 minutes later they finally told me i failed.
30 minutes later they finished the diagnostic
20 minutes later they got my car back to me

here's the thing....if you want to take advantage of me, then at least have some coffee in the waiting room.
the staff was polite the entire time, the price they quoted me for the extended work was high, but not out of hand. but the way the whole thing went down was exactly why i still take my car to my regular mechanic 17 miles from my house."
223,negative,"worst company i have ever come across! on the ride we had a miss hap and broke the black plastic foot well. the owner tried charging us for the entire back plastic as well. the owner said she doesn't jimmy rig her atv's mean while it wasn't until after the ride we noticed 6 plugs in the side wall of a tire. this is a huge no no and could cause the tire to blow. when we mentioned this to the owner she said we aren't talking about that atv, we are talking about the one you damaged. we expressed she put our life in danger when she allowed her company to operate this atv. she finally said it was her only choice because a new tire was on backorder. but they dont jimmy rig stuff right? the drive even warned us on the way back from the ride, they were going to try and get all they can. he also proceeded to tell us about all his legal problems which was pretty unprofessional. he also told us in the same atv with the plugs they have the wrong transmission bolt on it to along with a list of other things he could tell us. the driver told us how he and jim (the owners husband) were saying can you believe she is trying to charge them for all that. so they both knew what she was trying to do was unethical. if you care about your family's safety please avoid this place like the plague!!!!!"
224,negative,"buyer beware!!!

i purchased a truck from this establishment and added a provision that the truck had to pass my mechanic's inspection. i'm so glad i did that!  the truck needed a new transmission. the mechanic said that the issues with the truck were obvious from any basic inspection. when i presented this to the dealership, they said they wanted their mechanics to fix it. i, of course, was not ok with this since the mechanics passed it through their first inspection, why would i think they were capable and/or honest enough to fix it correctly this time? they were not willing to even look at the paperwork from my mechanic and give them an opportunity to fix it.
in addition, the manager and the secretaries are rude and impatient and have a problem hearing out the customer.
i drove to mesa from tucson to look at trucks with this dealership. i feel that the dishonesty and poor customer service earns less than one star, but that just doesn't work here on yelp so they get 1 star."
225,negative,"this review is for cox tv, internet, home line bundle in general. not just one store. i have been with cox for quite a while. i now want to change providers. they are getting very expensive, customer service is not helpful and there are always issues with tv transmissions. they keep on giving out promotions which aren't actually a bargain to begin with and when so called promotion ends the price skyrockets. this just happened to me where a promotion i didn't even know i was on ended and my bill would go up $55 a month. so their solution was to drop me to cox economy and take away tv channels i did have. no more. i will be with another carrier very soon. do not use cox."
226,negative,"brought in a 05 jetta 2.5l for a check engine light. told me they needed to replace the valve cover and gasket, which i said okay lets do it. 600$ later and the car was running worse than when i brought it in, and they had no explanation for it, except that it's probably running worse because my spark plugs and ignition coils are bad. so after changing all plugs and coils, still running horrible (engine bogging, stalling, shutting off). changed the maf,still horrible. upon further review, the valve cover gasket was folded into the block, causing a gigantic vacuum leak. i didn't even bother to check as i trusted the work done for 149.99$ an hour. the only upside to my experience was how cool mike was about the situation. i came back in, explained everything with pictures as evidence, and he told me just come back with the parts and i'll give you your full refund. however, whoever the techs are in the back should be canned. it's insanity that they are licensed for these types of jobs and someone watching youtube videos can find the issue."
227,negative,"i used to purchase only chevy. my grandfather and several other relatives all retired from gm, so i was a chevy girl through and though - until i bought my impala.

the very first day i had the check engine light come on, took it to the dealership and it took them 4 days to ""reset"" the light as there was ""nothing wrong with it."" yeah right... that should have been a huge sign to me.

long story short, in 2 years i had this car in the shop 37 times. yep. no kidding. 37. that's thirty seven if you didn't get it the first time.

14 of those times were for a faulty transmission that the service department said ""they couldn't replicate the issue."" they ""corrected"" a faulty gear in the transmission and not three days later my car left me and my children on the side of the road - for the 14th time - as the transmission completely imploded. then they told me ""sorry but the transmission is no longer covered under warranty by three miles."" what?!?

i got rid of that car and bought an audi. and because of henderson chevrolet's shady business practices and service, i will never buy an american made vehicle again. and they still call and email me, even though i have told them several times to take me off of their list of customers.

avoid this place unless you want high prices and no service. or high prices and crappy service."
228,negative,do not buy a vehicle from here. shady dealership sold me a truck and after 2 months did a transmission service and found all kinds of metal in the pan. they did nothing about it. my brother bought a truck from hear also and after having to fill the tire every few days finally took it to a tire it has rim that is cracked and leaking. they did nothing said its wear and tear. stay away from hear.
229,negative,"i have had the worst car repair experience of my life over the last two weeks with brake masters store #209 off germann road in chandler. i went in to the location with a mis-fire on my honda accord. the manager informed me it needed a new ignition coil and new spark plugs. i was able to get the parts a little cheaper at the local autozone but had brake masters install the parts. when i picked up the vehicle the issue was not resolved. the check engine light was still on and when it took it back to autozone it was the same issue. i took my car back to brake masters. they said i need a valve adjustment for $360 and said they fixed the initial issue and the car was running fine. today i had an actual reputable mechanic fix my car, it was a bad fuel injector. the issue is fixed. it is clear the technicians and managers lied about fixing the issue and wanted to milk more money out of me. i am absolutely appalled. 

i cannot believe the service i have been provided and lack of ownership of brake masters for misdiagnosing the issue. everyone i have spoke with was condescending and argumentative. no one ever apologized or shown any level of customer service."

231,negative,"eurowise proved to be very untrustworthy very quickly. fortunately, i had a second and even a third opinion from someone skilled. the first time i took my car to eurowise (after an $1100 bill) it broke down in their driveway, the owned up to their mistake that caused it. i eventually left with my vehicle in 100% worse condition than when i arrived. they couldn't given me a definite solution to my car trouble yet wanted to replace my transmission for $3500 with one that they wouldn't clarify the origins of. not new and not rebuilt with a measly 30 day warranty. very shady. i took my car to an out of town dealer and sideshop pro repairman both giving me the same synopsis, there was nearly no transmission fluid in my vehicle. problem solved elsewhere, free of charge."
232,negative,"i just sent an email and fedex package to the dealership general manager (doug fleming) with full documentation of the following story and, hopefully, he will respond in a positive manner and i can change this 1 star review...here is the story:

i was stranded in las vegas from san diego last week when my 2007 corvette z06 overheated and the check engine light came on...so i immediately limped the car a total of 15 miles to the nearest dealership for help...and was given a $200 repair estimate to fix a cooling fan issue and told the job would take a couple of hours at most.  as i was stranded in town i chose to wait at the dealership for the repair so i could get back on the road home safely. 

turns out the power connector to the electric fan unit had fried...a part available for a few dollars and can be replaced by splicing some wires and a bit of labor.   however, the dealership kept me in the dark as to the actual repairs and they instead told me they had to replace the entire electric fan assembly that they claimed was also burnt out...and that they also needed to change my oil and flush the radiator because the fluids had become contaminated when the car got hot...with a total bill of over $1,500...even though i had just done the fluid changes done at my local service center 600 miles ago.  fortunately i kept them from doing the fluid changes.  

i asked the service manager if i could speak to the technician working on the car to discuss the repairs but was told that was not allowed. i also wanted to see the car and the damaged parts before they replaced them but was told i was not allowed back into the 'employee only' service area.

the car was finally presented back to me and the bill came to $1,283 and the work took six hours.  i again tried discussing the situation with the service manager (who finally brought out the technician) and was told - in no uncertain terms - that they knew how to fix my car and had done the same repair hundreds of times...and that i did not know what i was talking about.

i demanded return of the 'bad' parts and took them home to san diego...and went to my regular service center.  they immediately verified the electric fan was 100% fine and did not need to be replaced...and that they could have repaired my car in an hour or so by replacing the bad connector for a total estimated bill of about $200.

this is a clear cut case of a 'stealership' taking advantage of a stranded motorist and overcharging for a simple job.   i certainly hope my letter to the general manager and this review will provoke a positive response."
233,negative,"i bought a used 2008 jeep grand cherokee diesel from this dealership.  

at the time i didn't know it but this is a very very scetchy dealership.  at this time of the purchase of the vehicle both the sales manager and the financing manager talked me into purchasing an extended warranty.  i had looked over the contract and had asked questions. they told me 100% that everything (power train and body) was covered and any claims would be honoured without any problems.  
also at the time of purchase of the vehicle the sales manager said that the transmission fluid and fuel filter would be changed for me free of charge. 

a coupe of months after my purchase a fuel line broke one day driving home from work. i had the vehicle towers me back to raceway chrysler. they told me that the warranty company wouldn't pay for the repair because it was a rubber fuel line that broke.  if it were metal then they would have paid. 

about three months after that a check engine light came on.  i checked the code on my scanner and it was a swirl valve issue.  so i brought it back to raceway chrysler and they told me it was the intake manifold that was cracked.  again, they said the warranty company wouldn't pay because they claim the intake manifold want part of the engine !!

so i called the warranty company to inquire why they're not paying for the repair ($4300).  i got some ""expert mechanic"" that kept insisting what was told to me originally.  this company, first canadian protection plan, should be shut down for fraud and theft.  they sell consumers a warranty package and don't honour anything they claim they cover.  

anyways going back to raceway chrysler looking back i think they broke the intake manifold and just said that they found it cracked.   why i didn't clue in this earlier i don't know.  the engine code says it was a swirl valve issue, which is common on these engines, but the mechanic said he found a cracked intake manifold. after researching i found that if you're not careful when removing the swirl valve that the intake manifold can easily be damaged.  damage to the point where replacement is necessary.  i should have asked to see the old part.   

i ended up paying for the repair. 
so i get my vehicle back and when i get home i see another check engine light come on.  i scanned it and it said glow plug failure.  how can that be.  i had replaced all of them already myself with new ones.  so i pop the good and removed the engine cover.  
i see two things.  first the plastic intake tube flange that connects to the turbo was cracked and broken. 
second the connector for two glow plugs were disconnected.  i took pictures and showed the service manager at the dealership.  
i plugged to glow plug connectors back on drove back there and they replaced the intake tube for free. 

to sum up this review the sales manager (can't remember his name) is a liar and a typical scumbag used car salesman. i found out that the fuel filter and transmission fluid he said was going to be changed was never changed. 
the management of the dealership should be refunding everyone they sold that bogus warranty to.  the service manager said that she had so many customers that experience the same thing as me with the warranty company not paying out for repairs. 
lastly, if you do have your vehicle repaired here tell the service manager that you absolutely don't want the mechanic by the name of 'spike' to touch your vehicle.  he's a rude and grumpy person that thinks he knows everything. he's the mechanic that worked on my cherokee and broke it, and couldn't even put it back together properly. 

zero (had to put one star as a minimum) stars for this place !!!   do not go here...."

238,negative,"horrible service department & customer service

i took my honda into hendrick's service department after the car displayed alarming and serious issues with the automatic transmission.  basically, i could feel the car jerk violently when shifting gears and then when i went to parallel park it wouldn't shift into reverse at all. i described the issue in clear and competent detail and left the car with hendrick's for it to run diagnostic testing.

the service department called me later that day and told me they drove the car and it was fine.  i was told the car did not need any repairs. upon questioning the service manager, he has refused to confirm the number of times the car was driven nor the distance driven.   however, i was positive something was wrong and that the car was dangerous.  so, we left the car with them from saturday morning until monday night, which gave them an entire weekend to physically examine the vehicle. apparently, during  this time they could not ""recreate the symptoms.""

honda has not indiated that they actually opened the hood and physically examined the car, which seems to be a pretty necessary component to determining whether my car had any mechanically issues. nor did they call me to ask me additional diagnostic questions about the symptoms. this seems to be more than a bit ridiculous.  i understand that cars are extremely technological in this day and age, but is an auto mechanic not capable of diagnosing a very obvious and well described transmission problem?

so, hendricks sent us home and i told myself it was a fluke.  i believe that i rationally assumed a mechanic wouldn't send me away with a dangerous car.  i mean, wouldn't a mechanic at an allegedly established dealership do his or her due diligence in determining whether there was a problem?

four days later, i had to drive 6 hours to help a friend who had recently undergone surgery.  barely three hours into my trip, my car started displaying the exact same violent jerking when shifting gears.  it would also not shift into a higher gear.  this all occurred while traveling on a major interstate. to more accurately invoke an image of this terrifying experience, i would like to share that i was nearly rear-ended by a semi truck and then had to stand on the side of the interstate by myself for a hour before having my car towed 45 minutes to the nearest dealership. i also had to drive a rental car for a week and a half - all at my own expense.

after this ordeal, which could have been avoided had honda taken the time to actually inspect my transmission (turns our pieces of the gear had broken and caused the transmission problem) i took the car back in to tell them what had happened and for an additional minor repair. the customer service was terrible.  they merely stated that they did ""everything possible to find the problem.""  oddly enough, i have received absolutely not follow up or any semblance of ""customer service"" in response to my email asking for further details as to what diagnostic steps were taken to determine whether my car was in safe, driveable condition (and obviously, it was not).  my personal favorite anecdote from the initial response i received from hendricks is the service manager stating that ""we also can not steal or guess at a repair."" ummm, who asked you to guess or steal?! i thought you were skilled professionals who could actually figure out a transmission problem....
 
the best part is that my exact model of car had a recall on the transmission, because of a very similar problem - pieces of one of the gears were breaking off and causing transmissions lock up. thanks for the diligent research honda!

basically, do not expect hendrick honda's service department to go the extra (or frankly any) mile to fix your car. if the check engine light isn't on, don't even bother. i thought a dealership was the most trustworthy place to have repairs done, but i'm never setting foot in that place again.  i probably would not recommend this overpriced, underqualified service department to my worst enemy. steer clear."
239,negative,"brought in my car for check engine light. i read the reviews that these guys are reasonable and would be able to take care of what i thought was the problem (just an o2 sensor). sure enough, that was the problem. so i get the bill for what was done and what i can pay to have done:

""$50 labor to scan engine codes""
""$0.92 shop supplies"" (no supplies were used)

then if i wanted to continue on it would be $70 for labor and $255 for the part.
yeah okay...

so autozone checks codes for free and i can buy the obd ii diagnostic code reader (which i have but left 2 hours away) on amazon for (in order of products) 21.99, 14.95, 31.99, 16.99, 39.99.

it's a 15 minute fix with an o2 sensor crows foot (which you can buy for under $10) and i found the identical part for 86.90.

needless to say, i am never returning and i suggest you don't even bother checking them out."
240,negative,"it's taken me a while to write this, as this occurred the week the dealership moved to their new location...but the experience was so horrible, i have to share.

my car buying experience here was fine.  the typical pushy salesman, however i am a good enough haggler (who knew?) that after an hour of back and forth with them, and just about leaving twice, i got exactly the payment, interest rate and loan period i knew i deserved with my exceptional credit score.

move forward a few months, and i have a check engine light on my brand new car.  i call to make an appointment to have it checked out, and after being transferred to 3 or 4 different equally surly representatives, i am able to get in the next morning at 7 a.m.  now, this dealership was a 25 minute drive from me, however, since the buying experience was fine i decided to stay with them for the repairs as well.  i manage to get out of the house early, with my 2 year old in tow, and get to the dealership right on time...only to discover that they had moved.  their first day open at this location was literally the day before, when i had called to make the appointment.  the man i spoke to apparently didn't think it was pertinent to inform me of this.  so, i wasted 25 minutes of my time, one way, to get here, only to find they were gone a further 25 minutes away.  another 45 minutes later, my son was at daycare and i was at work calling chapman instead.  if this is the kind of customer service they provide, i have no interest in furthering a relationship with them.

on the contrary, the people at chapman were exceptionally friendly and prompt, and had my car fixed in less than a day, after giving me a loaner to get back to work.  the issue was rats chewing through a wiring harness.  instead of replacing it, they were able to solder the wires together and wrap it back up, which cost less than $75 rather than a few hundred."
241,negative,"service department is full of liars and thieves!

i moved here from out of state and have never had any problems with the other 2 hyundai dealerships i've used in the past to service my vehicle. i wrongly assumed that chapman hyundai would be as honest and reliable as the hyundai service departments i'm familiar with. boy was i wrong!

i took my car in for an oil change. i also had a slow leak in my tire that i asked them to address. in addition, i knew that my battery was poorly charged because we had left a light on a few days before and had to jump the battery twice. however, i planned on getting a battery through my aaa plan, so i didn't mention this issue to the service rep.

well, 2 hours later the rep comes back with my car's recommended ""treatment plan"". he says that the tire has a nail in it and is ""unfixable"" due to the location of the nail. 

also, all 4 tire treads are dangerously low and must be replaced to safely drive my car. =$900. 

he goes on to say that the engine filter and the cabin filter are filthy and recommends replacement. =$300. (hmmm...curious because i just had the cabin filter replaced 3000 miles ago at another hyundai service dept.) 

and, the fluids (power steering, transmission, oil, etc) are all filthy and must be flushed, cleaned, and replaced or i risk engine damage. =$800. 

interestingly, they didn't recommend a new battery which leads me to believe that they didn't even test it (despite the fact that they listed it as ""good"" on their multi-point check list)!

during my two hour wait i had watched the 2 service reps come in and out of the lounge and speak with multiple customers with this whole ""treatment plan"" charade. they did this to every single person they spoke with. not once did they just hand over the keys and say ""see you in 3k miles"". 

i politely declined their ""treatment plan"" and took my car to 2 different well known service departments for opinions. both said my tires still had miles to go. my tire was easily repairable. the filters looked clean. and neither recommended flushing and replacing fluids.

i spoke with the service supervisor this morning and he was not apologetic. he made excuses--his mechanic must have measured a different spot on the tires....their shop has different criteria for fixing tires....etc.

chapman hyundai should be ashamed of their behavior. they tried to scam me about multiple things allegedly wrong with my car that 2 independent service departments proved to be false. i would not recommend this service department to anyone and will be reporting them to the better business bureau."
242,negative,"i purchased my mazda 3 a year and a half ago and it's a great vehicle. however, the problems began soon after my 15,000 mile check up. i was told by service that going to a 3rd party shop was ill-advised because mazda ""wouldn't be able to assist"" or ""correct any issues"" because the service was provided by someone other than a mazda technician. fair enough. i'll give you that. yet, when you tell me that all the parts and functions in my vehicle are in great condition, i expect that to be the case. i don't expect the car to not start, lock, and have several warning lights popping up on the dash after 1,000 miles. i don't expect the solution to be ""replace the battery key fob"" rather than having someone examine the vehicle. more importantly, i don't expect to have a female receptionist (didn't get her name but she worked today for the 11:45 am slot) telling me multiple times that the service department is closed on sundays. i'm sorry, but that is not the answer to every question. 

i'm having multiple warning lights popping up. ""i'm sorry, but the service department is closed."" 

are you telling me that i'm stranded for the next day and a half because my car won't start now? ""i'm sorry, but the service department is closed."" 

is there anything you can do to help? ""i'm sorry, but the service department is closed.""

now, i'm sorry because i didn't realize i was speaking with a parrot. 

needless to say, customer service may have been excellent when i first purchased my vehicle, but that is definitely not the case after the vehicle has been purchased. for a large dealership, i expected much, much more. very disappointed. 

i will not bring my vehicle to be serviced here any longer."
243,negative,"the sales manager keith is a total douche bag!! i bought my 200s less than a year ago and since have had nothing but issue after issues with it. after my car being in there for transmission issues 4 times for the same problem and 55 days later chrysler decided to give me a replacement car ok good. now after several attempts at trying to repair my car and not being able to you think they would go above and beyond to make things go as smooth as possible and getting me into a different car, well one would hope at least but no keith the sales manager wants to sit on his hands eat pizza and do nothing to help or even let me pick out a replacement car. even after impartial services contacted him and told him to have me come down there and pick out a car and by the way they i must also tell you the level of their service department and the damage they have caused first cracked my windshield when they were supposed to repair a small rock chip damaged 2 of my wheels on my car and also used up my gas time and patients. after showing them the huge crack in my windshield and the damage to the wheels they said ""you have insurance don't you?"" and then offered 2 free oil change really???? however when i said something about the gas they were happy to fill it back up.
my car is still in there to this day and i'm stuck in this rental until i can get a replacement so i will not be doing any more service, sales or anything else they sell here ever!!!
on the bright said travis in the service department has been very nice and as helpful as he can be sorry i won't be dealing with him anymore after this...."
244,negative,"my son needed a new transmission before going back to school....not only was he misquoted, he was treated rudely, overcharged, and the transmission was not completed properly.  he found a mechanic who had to reconnect several parts and was appalled at amateur job.  thankfully he fixed it but did suggest we take his bill (which was reasonable and fair and fixed the problems) back to this amateur shop and get reimbursed..do not trust this place!"
245,negative,"poor quality cars. bought a car here a few days ago and after we bought it, the transmission was slipping badly, the starter is going out, found out the back brakes are bad, and the oil pan was leaking. all for the low, low price of 203 every two weeks or 406 every month. prices are way above kbb values too. i understand that dealers need to make a profit, but the car shouldn't be sold for more than 6500 financed. they say they have ""free"" labor/diagnosis. it's not really free at all. it's included in the high price of the car. the car has a value of just under 4000 and the total we are paying for this piece of crap 2000 acura tl is well over 12000. this was the most stressful and frustrating car i've ever owned, and i really regret buying a car from this terrible place."
246,negative,"i went to the shop and previously had given them a 5 star from an issue i was having over the summer. i just moved from mn and my car was overheating. i took my car to the shop and explained the situation. they are very nice but that does not mean that the advice they gave me was right. they played the guessing game with the car looking at the water pump, temp sensor, thermostat, which were all options. they had told me that they had ruled out a blown head gasket, which i was pretty sure was not the issue as i was not leaking coolant anywhere and never needed to fill up.

after being there almost a week they had asked me if they could take it to another shop, but would have to charge me because they were being charged. i agreed and the diagnostic came back as a blown head gasket. i found this odd and they texted me a picture of the diagnostic, which showed that they actually were not charged for the service. they had quoted me that it would be $3,100 to get it fixed, which also seemed really high. i paid the $90 diagnostic and picked my car up 7 days after delivering it.

i was going through a bit of a cash flow problem and limited my driving and washed the temperature. i noticed as the temperature started to cool recently, the car would have to be under extreme stop and go traffic or if i had my a/c on low the temp would rise to the 3/4 mark.

yesterday i took my car to another guy. he quickly determined a few issues that were causing my problem. he stated the radiator was not operating properly and the radiator fans were working intermittently, as well as they were weak when actually operating. he did this from his house. new radiator, new radiator fan motor, transmission flush, and labor it cost me $550. i put my car through a test today driving around for an hour in stop and go traffic and blasting the a/c...... the problem has been fixed. 

so the company that did the diagnostic? i thought this was a gm dealership as he had stated, i checked with the 2 dealerships within a few miles of their shop, my car was not taken to either one of them. they also stated that a blown head gasket at their shop would only run about $2,200. that was at a dealership and was $900 cheaper than this place. plus they did not take it to either dealership, so i am not sure where they took it for the $90 they charged me and of course was a wrong diagnostic.

the trust factor with this place is now gone. i felt i should update my findings as i previously appreciated their due diligence, but now feel a bit ripped off. thank goodness it only cost me $90 to learn my lesson.

that was just my experience"
247,negative,"i can confirm with the other reviews that this dealership is terrible. it's the epitome of why people hate dealerships because they lie and only have their best interest in mind. situation: i brought my car in because two shops told me something was faulty with my transmission. they both mentioned it was under warranty and that nissan would have to replace it. it's a known issue on 07' & 08' nissan sentras. well, i brought it in, was charged $95 for them to check it out and lie about the noise being the left wheel bearing. cool, then why is my check engine light on? long story short, i brought it to another nissan dealership that knows what they're doing and they're replacing the transmission. more business for them. the manager alfredo was also of no help."
248,negative,"j'ai acheter un subaru usager dans la transmission faisait défaut. le kilométrage est encore sur la garantie du fabricant j'ai eu la chance qu'elle soit couverte. j'ai tout de suite remarqué une différence lorsque je les ai informé que je n'avais pas acheté le véhicule chez eux. j'étais devenu moins important. il m'a coûté 500 $ de ma poche pour changer l'huile de transmission qui était défaillante. le problème étant  physique, j'ai dû retourner au concessionnaire pour qu'il accepte finalement de changer. j'ai du perdre envoyé viens un bon huit heures de temps d'attente et d'essai routier qui aurait plus se faire faire par le garagiste lui-même pour constater le problème. cela donne encore moins envie d'acheter un véhicule neuf, peut-être que mitsubishi est une option qui va m'intéresser pour la prochaine achat de voiture."
249,negative,"came in for transmission fluid replacement and they told me i needed to change all my brake pads plus the rotors in the rear needed to be replaced. they quoted me 525 just for the brakes. i went to another repair shop and they said all my rotors were fine and even showed me. i think they were trying to play me cause i'm a girl who knows nothing about cars. thankfully, my dad told me to leave and gave me a normal ballpark on the cost of brakes. ladies, if you go into any auto shop, ask someone who's well versed in car maintenance or take an auto repair course cause these men will play you.


update: they said i should be expecting a call immediately in their response but i haven't sooooo that response is just for show."
250,negative,"i went here after reading the reviews on december 8th and still don't have my car fixed. my car never had issues and then one day while i was at a stop light it wouldn't go. i pushed all the way down on the gas, it went 20mph, and then finally kicked into gear. this is the reason why i brought it in the first time. they said it was my air flow sensor and so they changed it. i went to pick up my car and the next day it had the same issue. i took it back for the second time and they said it was a communication error that they fixed. picked up my car, took it home, and the next morning it would not start. i had my car towed there for the third time for them to work on it. they said it was my battery and replaced that. then a few days later my car started having the original issue it was having where it wouldn't kick into gear. i took it back for a fourth time and they changed the computer for the transmission. i picked it up and that same day it broke down on las vegas blvd. i called them and they sent a tow to get it. they have had my car for the fifth time since friday night and are still not sure what is wrong with it. i am having it towed to nissan dealership so they can hopefully figure it out. 
they did refund me for the second the second repair they did but not the first.  i have paid over $900 for a car that is not working and now have to pay to have  it towed somewhere else. this has been going on for 18 days. there is no way i could ever recommend this place to anyone."
251,negative,"last week i had my son take the 2010 jeep wrangler in to be serviced because the check engine light had came on was and i wanted to insure  vehicle was in safe operating condition for his commute to nau in flagstaff from phoenix.  not to mention we noticed it was starting and running very rough. 

after multiple days in the shop and $1800 later the check engine light was off and we were told that the vehicle was good to go.  please note that my son specifically spoke to items that he felt might have been going wrong with the engine to the technician by the name of ryan. none of the issues which were verbally spoke about where even addressed.  they blew his concerns/ assessment off like he had no idea what he was talking about.

they ended up doing some suspension work. along with some other miscellaneous things. 

the purpose of dropping the vehicle off was to make sure that the engine was safe and sound for my son who is going away to college. two days later on a road trip to college the vehicle breaks down. completely disabled 50 miles outside of our destination-  the oil light flashed a a few times -the engine completely seized leaving my 18 year old son ,myself and my 12 week old  baby bstranded on the side of the highway!  exactly what i was trying to avoid ....

after waiting on a tow truck for 2 1/2 hours  and spending another $200 to have it towed into town to an authorized  dealership we had  a full diagnostic ran.

it was determined that the engine needed to be completely replaced. bearing in mind the whole purpose of taking the vehicle in to be serviced the week prior was to make sure that the engine was in sound condition. as it stands in order for trucks only to apply the engine for life warranty they are stating i  i have to supply receipts of service for the last three years (which is not an issue)  however i feel as though they should own their part reguarding  their neglect in the service that was performed days prior to the engine breaking down.

 granted no one has a crystal ball however the vehicle was in their possession for almost a week and $1800 was spent specifically to insure that the vehicle was in sound operating condition. it's apparent that it was not!

as of today i am paying $475 to tow it back into phoenix and have  it left at truck only #trucksonly and having to jump through hoops to get repairs going.  not to mention the $145 diagnostic fee i had to pay to the author rise dealership to confirm that it was in fact the engine. 

after speaking with jason the service manager and head of the department it's apparent that nobody wants to own responsibility for the lack of service that was performed two days prior to the breakdown. 

that simply is unacceptable. especially when the owner spoke specifically to what the concerns were and they were completely ignored and unauthorized repairs were done instead. 

that is why they're receiving a one star rating!
due to their inability to own their role in this infortunate  turn of events.   

yes there are multiple facets to my discontent - the $1800 that i ended up paying last week was for repairs that i didn't even authorize. the service technician ryan was supposed to call us and provide a cost difference in suspension work versus doing a lift and instead of doing so they just proceeded with the repairs and then charged me for something that may or may not have been needed depending on the direction i wanted to go. 

i've been a loyal customer for years purchasing over 5 vehicles in last three years.  most recently purchasing an 2018 suburban at 50 k !

i have even referred multiple people to purchase vehicles from this organization again only to have to jump through hoops to get my referral bonus.

when it comes down to their service warranty don't expect it to be done without substantial effort's and if you expect them to own any errors or repairs orders be prepared to talk to people for weeks if not months to get it done.

that is not the way you treat a loyal customer. and it sure as hell is not how you treat somebody was gone above and beyond to make sure that their vehicle is in operating condition- safe and sound for their child  leaving for college and as a result of your inability to diagnose or fix a problem an entire family was put in unsafe conditions on the side of the highway.

254,negative,"their oil changes are worth the trip. i had around 3 oil changes without any trouble.  i did however, go in one day with a ""check engine light"" and the tech's diagnosis was loose spark plugs.  the compression within the cylinders turned out to be okay.  his proof that everything was okay was the lack of the check engine light being on during his test drive.  well durr, i can make the check engine light disappear by disconnecting the battery for a few minutes.  i left and the next day the check engine light turned on again and i failed my smog check.  *sigh*  this cost over $200, so for doing nothing, that's a bad deal."
255,negative,"i made a service appointment to bring my vehicle in on a saturday to have an a/c issue addressed.  two hours after dropping the vehicle off at the scheduled appointment time, i received a phone call from the service technician (aj) informing me that the shop hadn't even had a chance to look at it yet and they'd likely need it until monday.  after explaining that i couldn't make that work, aj then proceeded to make excuses why they were backed up, and then had the gall to tell me that had i brought my vehicle in earlier, there wouldn't have been a problem.  confused by this, i politely asked him what the point of making an appointment was for, and he responded by claiming he had told me to bring my vehicle in ""as early as possible"".  (this absolutely was not the case.)  he said he'd do what he could and then call me back.  finally, after not hearing from him for another hour or so, i contacted him and he told me my vehicle was being worked on.  i asked how much for the repair and he said he didn't know, that it depended on the amount of labor hours involved.  after picking my vehicle up a couple of hours later, the bill was almost $900.  aj could not articulate why the bill was so high, only that the work was extensive.  i asked how much their hourly labor rate was, and he told me $135.  obviously, this didn't add up since they started working on my vehicle only a couple hours prior.  at this point, i had had it and didn't want to argue -- i just wanted to leave and put this terrible experience behind me.  

as i drove home, i noticed my check engine light was on, which clearly had not been prior to taking the vehicle to peoria ford.  once i put it in park, i noticed the idling was erratic.  so, i reluctantly stopped by the following monday morning on my way to work to have them look at it.  immediately aj went on the defensive as soon as i stated that these new issues did not exist prior to bringing it in the first time.  i insisted they look at it immediately, and once they did, i was told the vehicle was throwing a code they could not diagnose because they didn't have the time, that they were too busy.  

not surprisingly, my brother had an awful experience with aj and peoria ford when he took his vehicle there previously.  

this is the first review of any kind i've written on yelp, and i simply had to do it, as this was some of the worst service of any kind i've ever experienced.  i will certainly never give my business to peoria ford again.  i truly hope their management reads this and takes heed to the complete breakdown in their service operations.  i would truly be embarrassed if i were part of their leadership team."
256,negative,"i purchased my cruze from findlay chevrolet about a year and a half ago. the experience was good. i found the exact car that i wanted on their website and went in to purchase it. it was concerning that the sales associates didn't know that the cruze came in a manual transmission when i asked about the specific car, but they found it and i purchased it that day.

i didn't have issues with their service department until recently. about 2 weeks ago i took my car in for an oil change at 7am. by 3pm i hadn't heard from them, so i called to follow up. they said that my car was finished at 9am and they were sorry nobody called me. it would have been nice if they called me so i could have picked my car up on my lunch break.

a couple days ago i called to set up an appointment to have my brakes checked. they set up the appointment for yesterday morning at 8:30am. i dropped it off around 8 and took the shuttle to work. (all of their shuttle drivers are very nice.) i hadn't heard anything by around 1:30pm, so i called and left a message with my service advisor. i didn't hear back from her for over an hour, so i tried calling back two more times before i finally was able to talk to her and found out that my car hadn't even gotten in yet. 

this morning i called to follow up and left her a voicemail. i didn't hear back from her, so i called and left a voicemail with another advisor for her to call me back. i still didn't hear back from her for about an hour, so i called again and was finally able to talk to her only to find out that my car still had not even been looked at by their mechanics. i asked why i made an appointment only to have my car sit on their lot for over a day. i was told that the appointment was to talk to the service advisor, and not for them to actually inspect the car. i told her that i wanted to come pick up my car, which i did and when i took it to another mechanic they were able to take car of my car within a couple hours. i will not be returning to this dealership."

on january 17, 2017 i brought in my 2010 toyota camry to usa auto service located on 3665 s durango dr las vegas nevada 89147. i brought in my vehicle for a smog check and to check if there were any problems my car was having.  the check engine light and stability control off light were both on.  they charged me $1570.52 for my car to be fixed. when i went to go pick up my car i asked the front desk for a copy of my car passing smog so i can show the dmv. the gentlemen at the front desk told me i didn't need a copy and that the dmv already has a record of my car passing smog.  after waiting at the dmv for over 3 hours, the worker at the dmv told me that my car did not pass smog.  i went back to usa auto asking them what happened and dave the service manager told me that they didn't do a complete drive cycle because i didn't ask for one.  i go back home and look at my receipt and informed dave that i did pay for the drive cycle.  so i bring my car back and dave asked me to bring my car in monday or tuesday.  it was the weekend and i didn't think he had time to do the drive cycle for me. but he also told me to drive my car until my gas was halfway full.  i got the feeling that he didn't want to do the drive cycle for me even though i already paid for it.  i brought my car back and dave checked to see if my car needed to get a drive cycle which it did and then finally my car passed smog after bringing it in for the third time.  
 
a couple weeks have passed and my check engine light and stability control off light both came on again.  i brought my car back in on february 21, 2017 and dave said that there was a slight air leak and that he would fixed it free of charge. the day after, i pick up my car and drive it for a couple of miles.  not only did both lights go on again but my battery had died and my car was sitting in the middle of the road for a couple of minutes. my car was far from being fixed.  i turned off my car for a couple minutes to let it cool off and turned it back on again. my car turned on but i didn't feel safe driving it. i bring my car back again (feb. 22) and this time dave had taken the day off and so i spoke to the general manager.  he looked at my car and told me that i needed to replace the throttle body which would cost me $372.50 and wouldn't charge me for labor. he told me that after the throttle body was fixed i wouldn't have any more problems with my car.  sadly that wasn't the case.  
 
on march 1, 2017 i bring my car back again because the same lights went on february 24.  i haven't heard from them in a couple of days. so i called the following monday asking what's going on with my car.  dave told me he's not quite done with my car yet and to call him again at the end of the day or the next day. they've had my car for over a week now and i'm assuming they've been working on my car for a week straight and haven't figured out what's wrong with my car or my car hasn't been a priority for them and they're looking at it only when they have time. either way usa auto should've fixed my car the first time i brought it in, but it's taken them five times. when my car was finally ready to be picked up dave told me that there was an air leak and wouldn't provide a receipt.  three hours later, both lights went back on.  i took my car to the toyota dealership and paid $150 for an inspection. toyota told me that usa auto installed the throttle body incorrectly and that was the reason why my lights were on. toyota finished within less than 3 hours.  i do not recommend going to usa auto for anything related to your vehicle. if you are considering ever taking your car to usa auto, think again. i went to usa auto thinking i would save money but now i know better, i would gladly pay a little extra going to a dealership knowing that my car will get fixed guaranteed."
258,negative,"i knew tony for a long time.  i have family that have known toni for even longer. however this man let his ego get the best of him.  we took our car there roughly 4-5 times to get engine replaced  among other stuff only to find out it wasn't the engine and it was always something else.  tony couldn't ( or wouldn't ) seem to find out what was the problem.  and honestly that's ok. i have no problem with that as long as he is willing to turn it around and fix it. we all make mistakes, that could have been turned around with the check engine lights constantly coming back on after leaving his lot, this was becoming a growing issue, also a doable and solvable problem. however tony was not willing to deal with his mistakes. more importantly, tony was unwilling to have a good attitude.  he literally referenced to my ""wife that you make a lot of money anyway so it shouldn't matter what the cost is."" he said this right after we were stranded with both of our infant children in the car not even an hour after getting our car back from his shop. no empathy whatsoever.told us that we don't know we were talking about. he wouldn't hear us out and lastly he wouldn't take back the engine that started the cascade of all these problems at first. when he finally did take the engine, he made demands as to how he wanted it back. that is the part that is unsalvageable and the part where myself or my family will never use his services again. and i urge you not to either. it may be self serving to make a couple of extra bucks initially but is it really worth your reputation as a mechanic with no integrity and people skills?"
259,negative,"stopped by this shop because i saw the words 'free diagnostic ' boldly emblazoned on the front of the building to see if they'd look at why my check engine light was on and just read the code. 

well the person told us that to do a diagnosis it would be $95.00. the good thing was that that $95.00 would be applicable to the repair work if done at their shop. sounds fair. 

but why have 'free diagnostic ' on the front of your building if you don't even want to hook up a code reader to my diagnostic port under the dash that would take all of ten minutes or so to tell me what's wrong with my vehicle? i mean i get it, i even might have had my car repaired there since we were on vacation and it stresses me out to see that check engine light on. 

remove the free sign, it's misleading."
260,negative,"on january 26, 2019 at 1:05pm i had dropped off my car at audi northlake (10831 northlake auto plaza blvd, charlotte nc 28269) to jasmine scott for a recall part.  as 4:14pm that same day three hours later jason leake called me and reported that they found timing chain tensioner extended by six teeth. he reported that this was very serious and it needs to replaced right away or tow my car since i should not be driving it at all. i was very shocked due to the fact on october 23,2018 i did pass full service on my car and nothing was wrong.  also with that it came with a nice price point which was $2,069.93. i told them i had to think about it because my car was so new only at 55,000 miles did not expect such major problem so soon. on monday morning i spoke to gary burke management to see what was going on. he told me it was a class action lawsuit but my car would not qualify for it. i also asked him how did my car pass everything in october he said they do not check on timing chain, not in till november of 2018, so before november this was never done before. gary said they best they can do is pay for the parts since my maintains on my vehicle was on excellent condition and i still have to pay for labor $1,100.  as of this morning juanuary 29, 2019 i tried calling the general manager chad lamprey twice still no return of my phone call. i spoke to my friend who is mechanic in chicago, il got audi who stated a few things that i found very interesting. 


1. it should take about four -five hours to fully remove all the part and check on my timing chain. it only took them only 3hrs from bringing in my car to call me and let me know. 
2. i should be having a check engine light on which has never came on 
3. i should have issues with starting my car and my car should be making noise and shaking 

all those things have never happen. my car was driving normal no issue at all. i feel like i am being taken advantage as a woman. no one is trying to help me at all with my concern or explain to me why this is happening only at 55,000 miles. when i asked gary burke his answer was "" i really can't tell you"" which that to me does not sound like a good explanation. i am asking for help and assistance since no one is helping me. this is my first audi and i have enjoyed it so much in till now. i have never been taken advantage like this before not with mercedes, bmw or lexus.

261,negative,"as a retired backyard mechanic who has done dozens of disc brake repairs, i went to this place to get the disc pads on the front replaced early before any damage to the rotor occurred.  

they gave me an estimate of over $390.  they wanted to replace all sorts of items that i knew were in fine shape.

my wife insisted we go to the dealer.  went there & (without telling them about just brakes estimate), they inspected the front brakes & told us they were find & just needed the pads replaced.   

took it to a third place & had the pads replaced for under $150.

avoid these guys, they make their money by jacking up the bill.  my mechanic friends have told me dozens of horror anecdotes about brake & transmission shops.  i guess it all depends on the tech they assign you & how much profit he wants to make."
262,negative,"please read and make your own opinion!! writing this review in hopes i can't prevent at least one person from getting scammed. 

i was told that my repair was going to be from $1,600 to $1,900.00  once my truck was taken apart i was told it was going to be $2,900.00.  i ended up purchasing a used transmission from another place and dropped it off.  i was still charged $1,300.00 just to install it.

i was forced to pay (in cash) and i was told if i didn't pay soon that i would be changed a daily storage free. 

when i came to pay there was another family in the office claiming they have experienced the same bait and switch scam. once he has your vehicle taken apart, he's got you. he can charge you whatever he wants and will hold your car hostage until you pay. 

i am very disappointed in the owner.  either all these people are lying, or the owner greg is a liar and a thief.  if the prices are in line with the industry standards, he at least needs to quote more realistically.  i'm obviously not the first one to experience this.

i forgive you greg.... and i hope karma does the same. it's not too late to start operating as an honest business.

to anyone else, do your self a favor and just find another shop."
263,negative,"is it a job requirement for all car salesman to be the lowest form of human beings? how do they sleep at night deceiving and lying to their customers to make a sale?
i'm been dealing with moore chrysler jeep located at 8600 w bell rd, peoria, az 85382 and this is by far the worst dealership in arizona. unfortunately, i had the displeasure of dealing with the worst sales person, randy dominguez. i was sold a car (ford focus) that i was told had a minor recall and the car needed to be sent to ford to fix. i signed all the paperwork on saturday and was told i could pick the car up on wednesday. they said it was a quick fix.  3 days later when i hadn't heard from them at all about the status, i called to find out what was going on. i talked to multiple service/sales people and i was told they didn't know where my car was or that i just need to call back and when i would call back no one answered the phone.  i finally was able to reach randy dominguez (unfortunately) and he began telling me there were other issues with the car. he mentioned the transmission, the clutch and he lied and told me they were all part of the recall.  i think he just felt he could tell me anything and i would believe him. well i looked up the recall to review the exact nature of the issue and of course none of these issues were part of the recall. this car was on their lot for over a month (since at least may 26th) before i went in to purchase it on june 29th and they said they had no idea the car had any issues, but they were working on getting fixed...so i guess that's why i didn't receive a call. no one called me once they found the issues to tell me about them. i had to reach out to them and track down someone that would speak with me.  when i told them, i was not buying a lemon car from them, randy then proceeded to tell me it was not an option to get my money back and void the sell. at that point it was clear randy wasn't knowledgeable enough to deal with this situation and it needed to be elevated to someone more competent. randy also said the dumbest thing. he actually said ""how was it their fault that they didn't know about the other issues with the car? i mean you can't make this stuff up...crazy! i said well it's a car at your dealership that you are trying to sell so you should know before you deceive customers. this just leads me to believe they don't do a lot of inspections on their cars before selling them. i hope this isn't the case.  i mean were they going to just fix the repairs and not tell me there was anything additional wrong with it? is that why they never called me back after i was in the dealership purchasing the car?
it's still not resolved but i did receive a call back from keith diskin, sales mgr. and he admitted on the phone that these other issues that were wrong with the car were not part of the recall as randy dominguez lied and said they were. when i told keith that i had disputed the deposit payment with my bank he then was at a loss for words and was done talking to me. he said he was sending me back to randy to void everything. randy was such a nasty person that should not be the face of any customer service or sales organization. he began lying again about why he couldn't give my deposit back (because i disputed it), he said his accounting department was closed...i guess they have banker's hours because this was at 4pm.  randy dominguez said if i hadn't disputed it they would just write me a check and void paperwork and then i said well i can come to the dealership today and he said the accounting department is closed so we can't do anything until friday. i had already asked the bank how this could be resolved if they give me the deposit back and the bank just needed a letter stating they were giving me my deposit and that i provide that to the bank and the dismiss the claim. randy would not do this. he spent at least another 20 minutes on the phone trying to tell me why he couldn't' give me my deposit and write a written statement saying they would give me my deposit back since i filed a dispute through my bank regarding the deposit. he even at one point asked me why i did that.
unfortunately, keith diskin and ceo connie churchill moore are entrusting their name and reputation to low level, incompetent sales people that should never ever be allowed to speak with customers or the public.
i think people should know which dealerships to stay away from if the leadership at these places is not going to take the time to hire the right people to handle customers. stay away from moore is my only advice to car buyers."
264,negative,"i took my car several times to this shop,all good until the final visit which is disappointing as i know its tough to get a good mechanic in vegas,i live here.
car in the entire day,lots of work done,pricey to be expected.
car dropped at my work (very nice touch),unfortunately a check engine light on,cars idling was horrible,way off,3rd cylinder connector not even connected.car drives like crap,not even close.
so it's given back with this issue?not making this up folks.put my car back together properly??
gets fixed by this shop(brought it back),turns out to be short lived.same issue again,misfires 3rd cylinder.
turns out the  female connector to the 3rd cylinder ignition coil was not even there(was before i took it in for work),zip tie applied by this shop to hold it in place,just wires no bracket..really???
i had to get another mechanic to rewire,reconnect,fix the issue
just not good enough,amateur stuff.
try someone else"
265,negative,"i wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. they've literally done more ""so called"" repairs on my car than i can count and yet my car is still broken down. they claim to have even rebuilt my engine and transmission and yet neither of them even function. i should have my head examined for ever going to this business in the first place. really, the only reason i did is because they were close to home. i am doing everything in my power to try and get my money back from these scam artists including taking legal action. i've repeatedly left messages to the corporate manager to contact me regarding these issues but to no avail. i'd just like to give everyone out there a heads up in regards to their business practices and ask that do yourself a favor and don't do business with these people. you will thank me later."
266,negative,"vehicle is again back to shop after rebuilt transmission in october. after 3rd time in shop and the day after tow truck delivered it to our home, still has a leak from transmission and now an oil leak that was not there before. if an option of a full refund were possible, would do that and take vehicle elsewhere. this has been a 3 month journey which has not been enjoyable."
267,negative,"this place is horrible. stay away.
went here because i was getting a car repaired and they set me up with a rental.
they picked me up at the collision center and the driver was real nice, it went south from there.
i was the only one there, took over 45 minutes to rent a car.
3/4 a tank of gas, like in gonna be able to hit that mark exactly when filling up. oh yeah $9.99 a gallon of you bring it back with less.

oh yeah. returning... i sat there for 10 minutes by myself. they finally showed up to check me in, another half hour of my life i will never get back.

they called a lyft to take me back to the collision center. omg the smoke cloud when i opened the door. i will never be using lyft, but that's a different review"
268,negative,i was hoping to build a relationship with a transmission shop since i have 6 company trucks that are always pulling trailers.  i found these guys online but wish i had yelped them first.  i sent my crew foreman in and had him request the heavy duty tranny so we would not have to go back.  they call and you go over their recommendations over the phone after they take everything apart and i agreed to the heavy duty rebuild.   after about 6 months the transmission went bad and it started to slip.  we went in but they said they found nothing wrong...so of course we drove it for another week before it completely blew after which case they said they saw the most damage they have ever seen and cant warranty unless i make other improvements onto my truck (lets not forget that a week early they said nothing was wrong).  so i agree to the additional repairs (both receipts are pictured on yelp).  the repairs included replacing the cluster that tells you what gear you are in.  they said the cluster was not clear which gear you are in and that is why my transmission went out....they seem to think we drove everywhere in first or second gear and never noticed.   after the repair now we cant get the transmission into overdrive.  needless to say i wont bother going back.  the customer service is poor and they are very pushy and bossy when dealing with issues.  i don't mind paying for repairs but if we want a real warranty i would go elsewhere.
269,negative,"i dropped my vehicle off for a 7am appointment on 7/3 and there were 2 other vehicles in front of me when the shop opened. i advised the service advisor that i had a check engine light that the quick service tech has advised was related to a glow plug and not a big deal. the service advisor advised they may need a week to complete repairs depending what they find, before he had even looked at the vehicle. i made sure the service advisor knew i had a glass appointment that was scheduled 2 weeks prior at 7am on 7/5. the sa agreed i could drive the vehicle 1 mile to safelite if they found an complex issue and had to order parts, and repairs would begin after the broken glass was replaced. even though i was 3rd in line, i did not receive a call until 4pm, when the sa advised they found a small fuel leak and were not able to complete repairs as promised, and would need to keep the vehicle until 7/5 and they would request safelite come to the shop to do the glass repair. i advised him that unacceptable since safelite had informed me their mobile techs could not replace the rear window and it had to be done in their shop. i requested the sa discontinue all repairs and return my vehicle to me as promised. the sa refused and said my vehicle was too much of a threat to me and other drivers because of the fuel leak. i informed the sa that i had just driven the truck, while pulling a 16k lb 5th wheel from seattle the day before and got the best mileage towing i had ever gotten with the f350. if i was able to drive the truck over 1500 miles the day before, i think it was safe to drive 1 mile without towing to make my appointment on 7/5. because of the great gas mileage i got the day before, i advised the sa i want to take the truck to another dealer for a 2nd opinion. the sa again refused to return the vehicle to me. i requested to speak to a supervisor and informed the sa i did not believe the information he provided. he put me on hold for 10 minutes, then returned to the line to tell me they were all in a meeting and not available to speak to me. the sa was able to get safelite to allow me to bring in the vehicle @ noon on 7/5, and did return the vehicle to me in time to make the later appointment. so essentially they kept my vehicle 2.5 days (due to being closed on 7/4) to complete a simple warranty repair, and had no regard for my rights, opinions, or obligations with my own vehicle. based on this treatment, i can not recommend this dealership to other drivers and will never return. i will have to drive 3x as far to another dealership, but i don't like having my property held hostage."
270,negative,"do not go here for service. i took my 2001 beetle here for a diagnostic on 3 check engine lights. i know how to work on vehicles but took it here anyways because i thought they could quickly and properly look into the problems so i didn't have to. no! i was very wrong. i dropped off my car at 8:45 in the morning & had to call twice because there was no update at 2pm and again at 4 something pm. the person handling my vehicle stated the first time i called that, ""that they actually had some questions about the car"" i answered their questions but if i had never called my car would have been sitting there for a while. they said they would continue looking into everything & get back to me. called again at 4 something very frustrated because i have a job to get to the next day and still no vehicle or update. second time i called the man handling my car says the same thing again as the first phone call which is complete and total crap. i let him know i was coming to get my car & he stated they would have it ready and washed ( which is apart of the price you pay there when getting a diagnostic ) i show up and my car is not washed, the ac is running which if they actually looked at my car they would know the ac does not work!!!!!!!! they did not even address all of my check engine lights!! they only came to a ""recommend"" fix for one check engine light but nothing for the evap!!! what the hell was going on all day? don't worry, i will never go back. on top of all of this they didn't even put shi*** back in my car. 


i want my money back for that 162 ""diagnostic"""

272,negative,"went in to get my moms ford escape looked at and was told i needed to rebuild transmision which i agreed to for $2400. 3 weeks later and excuse after excuse they tried to put a straight junk yard transmision in and said it was rebuilt, turns out they couldn't even get it in drive because it wasn't rebuilt just a cheap junk yard transmission.  ben (the owner) then gets so upset at himself that he rolled the dice to decieve me, he became completly irrate and claimed we were calling him 3 times a day which was true for the 3rd time saying it would be ready, 3 weeks of my moms car in the shop. ben  was the one actually calling me updating me every week with excuses why the car wasn't ready and it will be ready that following monday but never was.  finally he said that he was done with this and told me to pick up the car.  he put it in the parking lot behind aamco with out the transmission in it and said to come get it.  all we wanted was our escape fixed and was willing to pay the price he gave us of $2400.  this guy is a complete scam and also owns the store in concord, his name is good ol ben in the trasmission industry and every transmission shop knows he is a scam and hack which after the fact they warned me stay away from good ol' ben!  pleassse people find another trans shop as this dude wil lie to you.  unfortunatly i had another thansmission done by them which hasn't had an issue but im only 2 months into the 18mo warranty.  luckily it was done through my mechanic shop which just took the core to them to build!  don't believe me call every transmission shop in the charlotte area and ask about this guy and you make your own decission.  i wish i would have called around first but please, please beware of good ol ben and aamco monroe and concord!"
273,negative,"probably the biggest mistake i've made in awhile. i was referred here by my boyfriend's mechanic after my transmission failed. they towed me up and were communicative the first day. 

then a week and a weekend later, i finally get my car back... the rpm needle is jumpy but that's 'not abnormal at first.' um, k. oh, and it was covered in oil and grease all over the top and the hood. and then, about 400 miles in, my torque converter exploded. apparently it was defective... okay. i guess sh*t happens, right? it was covered on warranty and i will give them credit, they didn't give me any crap about the warranty and just started working on it.

so we tow her back in and i wait. and wait. they're just waiting on a new part... and then they get one in and they'd ordered the wrong thing. my boyfriend leaned on them to get a rental for me since it was all taking so long - which they agreed to. then they changed where the rental was coming from. then it has to be on our credit card and they'll just slide us some cash. nevermind, they'll just slide us cash. lol. guess what never happened? i opted just to keep taking lyft and the bus and losing hours of my time every day because at least i know what's up that way and i don't get stuck paying even more for this debacle.

after a little under two weeks, i get to pick up my car. it's covered in oil and gasoline this time. (though supposedly it never came off the lift.) ate right through the remaining paint. 

and without my knowledge or permission (or anyone else from my family who'd been calling on various days, from what i am aware of at this time) they replaced the axle for a ""hole in the boot"" - which, funny enough, i'd just had a bunch of estimates on stuff for my shocks/struts and a general onceover with attention to that area specifically from my mechanics about a week before my transmission took a dump, there was nothing wrong with that. fishy, but i'm so frustrated at this point, i leave. 

i noticed a rattle that night and the next morning, i look underneath and all the plastic from the undercarriage has been ripped from wheel to wheel and wasn't even screwed back up (the screw hole was fine) but was tucked in, probably so it wouldn't make a big flappy noise and i hopefully wouldn't notice. what the f*ck. i know my car and it was not like that.

oh, and they close at 3:30 and not 5, even though everywhere posted it says 5.

tl;dr avoid like the plague!!"
274,negative,"my mother had brought her van in for transmission service about a year ago.  she spent almost $2,000 for what she thought was a new transmission with a 1 year warranty.  she had brought her car in over the course of the year for routine service with the most recent being 8/1/13 with her car still being under warranty.  
today, we brought her car in because she could sense something was wrong with the transmission.   we were told that her 4th gear was on the verge of being gone and that a costly repair was necessary.  i had spoken with several people at the shop and was told they were going to make a ""deal"" with me, my mom would have to pay for the parts which range from $500-800 and they would waive the labor.  my question was, if this was a ""new"" transmission why would it be going out right after the warranty and why wasn't anything detected during the routine service that just occurred less than two months ago while the car was under warranty?
well, first contrary to what my mom was told, and what she had expressed to the transmission dealer, she was not given a new transmission.  her old transmission was ""rebuilt"" according to the owner; $1,800 for a rebuilt transmission?  second, when i called to ask why a ""new"" or ""rebuilt"" transmission would begin to deteriorate after a year, i was told simply ""it happens"".   the owner began to tell me that the dealership is as strong as the people in the back, basically implying (my interpretation) that the person who worked on my moms car a year ago was no longer with him.  i don't know under what circumstances he may have left, however i got the impression he may have done a poor job on my moms car.   basically, because someone on his staff didn't do their job right  it now became my mother's problem.  
i was basically asking question trying to understand how a ""new"" or ""rebuilt"" transmission could become faulty after a short period of time, i got a condescending answer in return.  i will say that my mother's van is old and needs to be replaced in the near future; however, after spending as much money as we did on a new transmission, we expected to deal with other issues until the time came to get her a new car.   not the transmission.  
the most shocking and a clear reflection of the integrity of this establishment was when the owner hung up on me.  i never once raised my voice, was rude, used a curse word or said anything else that would justify a cold hang up.  i mentioned that if this issue wasn't resolved fairly i would be forced to file a report with the better business bureau.    
i am one to always support small business and will continue to do so, however its people who lack professionalism and have no accountability because they are the owners, make people want to go to corporate run shops.

275,negative,"the only reason this dealership gets 1 star is because it's the least i can give.

we purchased from earnhardt years ago and had a terrible experience.  but we found the vehicle we wanted at a decent price and decided to give it a try again.  big mistake!  terrible service!

here are our issues:

1 - the vehicle's check engine light came on 2 days after we purchased it.  (this vehicle is still under manufacturers warranty.)  when my husband called about it they tried to give him the run around.  he did research before bringing the vehicle in and found that the issue required major engine repairs.  when dropping the car off the service advisor tried to indicate a minor issue and it wasn't until my husband shared his homework did he finally admit that there was significant word that would need to be done.  

2 - about 2 weeks after purchasing the vehicle my husband received a call from the finance department demanding he pay them over $300 for the vehicle registration.  my husband refused to give them money without any paperwork or proof and was accused of being a thief by the finance manager and the gm!  ultimately, they made a mistake on the registration fees on the paperwork and blamed my husband for not reviewing it prior to signing.  who reads the registration fee on a vehicle purchase agreement?!  and why is he stealing because they made a mistake and didn't catch it?!  terrible service!  we ended up paying it, but still have not received a receipt for the money.

3 - we have refinanced the vehicle and cancelled the gap coverage.  another run around to get the money back.  they have ridiculous hoops to jump through, excuses for everything and do all they can to delay any refund.  it will now take until the end of april to get our $800 back, even though it was requested the first week of march.  

every level of this organization lacks professionalism and customer service skills.  even the general manager accused my husband of being a thief because of their mistake on the paperwork!  how do you get return customers when you treat them in this manner?  we purchase a new car about once a year...  never again will we purchase from an earnhardt dealership!  guess tempe dodge will make a lot more money..."
276,negative,"this shop is a total joke. jim i guess the owner makes a lot of promises but does not follow up on them. brought my vehicle to them to rebuild the transmission and all they did was made it worse. i do not recommend this shop. a job that a normal shop would take 4 days took them almost a whole month. every time i asked if it was complete it was the same answer ""tomorrow"".. don't go here. honestly."
277,negative,"terrible, drove in and made an appointment for an oil change, with my 81 year old mother to have on her car.(she waited in the car) they quoted me $19.95 which i thought was very reasonable. the appointment was set for later that afternoon, i was not able to accompany my mother, feeling  ok with having her go on her own seeing the price was set. well not the case they changed her $65.00. using scare tactics and charging her for all kinds of extras... and it didn't end there, they wanted to book her for a transmission fluid change @$150.00
on a car with less than 50k miles that was getting service regularly in florida just 30 days earlier. 

bait and switch artist. .."
278,negative,"although my smog check was cheap $7.77- i can't support a dishonest company. they do a free complimentary check and basically tell you how much work you need done on your car. luckily i read some of these reviews and used some common sense but they told me that my brakes were at 30% and something about my transmission and filter. my car was bought brand new and is only 2 years old with 20,000 miles on it. i checked with subaru and they said i'm far from needing replacements for my brakes. can't be trusted! i'd rather pay more."
279,negative,the service department has gone real down hill since larry h miller took over. right now my truck is in service and getting status updates is a never ending voicemail nightmare. it also appears service techs do not have to be trained anymore to explain mechanics. the larry h miller tech appears to be nothing more than a voicemail and dialer to feed prices. my last quoted price was it will add a small fee to have the transmission pan inspected. which is suspect helpful when deciding financially what you want to do.

281,negative,i brought my car to the owner greg  about a leaking transmission i told him just let me know we're the leak was. he called me back in with my whole trans taken apart in piece now i'm stuck getting a new trans. then while my truck was under his possession the window is vandalized! come to find out the window was vandalize weeks before i found out on my own greg wasn't man enough to tell me but was happily taking my payments! lied about filing a police report and was not taking responsibility for my window! these are shysters and will do anything to get a buck! do not take your car here i repeat do not take your car here! (this is only the short story)
282,negative,"i would give peoria ford service and sales departments a zero star if able. the several times that we have taken our car is in for service we have received less than stellar service. this week's situation was the worst ever. not only did they want to replace my entire transmission rather than looking for the specific challenge there. we had several communication gaps leaving us to have to call them to see what the updates were in the service. once we found out how expensive it was going to be they promised that their sales person was going to call us to talk about a trade-in. that never happened. my husband called to asked to speak with the gm at the dealership and he was told that he would receive a call we are still waiting that call and it's been three days. i have owned 10 ford vehicles in my years.   both of my grandfathers were engineers at ford motor company.  i grew up in dearborn, michigan, the hometown of henry ford and i have always been an avid ford family. that will all be changing with the next vehicle i purchase. we will no longer purchase from peoria ford and our remaining 2 ford vehicles will not be serviced there."
283,negative,"i had a grinding noise in my 2007 chevy tahoe when placed in 4 wheel drive. after being diagnosed and receiving an estimate on a transfer case from a shop in my town, i drove to phoenix and brought my vehicle into advanced transmissions and emissions. i dropped the vehicle off with the service manager. later that afternoon he got back to me and told me it was not my transfer case , but my transmission (i would only be charged $50 to reseal my transfer case). a couple days later i got a call and said the fix would be approximately $2100 plus i needed to buy a new bearing for my transfer case that would cost $500 . $2600 total. this price also included the $500 charge to remove my transmission and diagnose the problem (which i was never told about.) i questioned about the bearing because just days earlier the transfer case was fine. i was told they would not warranty the work if the bearing was not replaced. 

after being in the hole for $550 already, i agreed to have the work done if that would solve the grinding noise (monday).  was told my vehicle would be ready wednesday or thursday. i called friday and was told my vehicle would be ready monday or tuesday. monday i got the call. when i picked up my vehicle i was told advanced transmissions had the front and rear differentials rebuilt (at no cost to me) that is why it was not ready thursday. i paid with my visa and left. i noticed that my invoice now read that  ""truck had more than one noise/problem."" when i placed my vehicle in 4x4 the grinding noise was still there. i stopped back at the shop and asked for the owner and he was not there. i had to get back home to go to work so i left town and disputed the charges with visa. with out knowing greg decided to take away my nation wide warranty.

the owner greg called me. he asked me to bring my vehicle back in. i told him i had to go to 
work and was not sure when i could get back to town. he told me to bring my vehicle to the dealership to get diagnosed. i scheduled an appointment i told the service advisor what was going on and i had paid to have my transmission fixed. he called me later that morning and told me they would have to start taking things apart to diagnose the problem. i told him to stop because i was under warranty and i didn't want anything to be questioned.

i called greg and asked him what we are going to do about this. he told me i was not any of the work they did, but my problem was my differentials. i called the differential shop he took my vehicle to and was told i have a one year warranty and did not have to go through advanced transmissions to honor the warranty. i brought my vehicle to the differential shop and within 15 seconds of hearing the grinding noise he diagnosed it as my transfer case. $1250 his cost to fix.

i called greg and told him what i did and found out. he then offered me $800 cash and he would fix my vehicle if i didn't dispute the charges on my visa (i said no) then $1300 check and he would fix my vehicle if i didn't dispute the charges on my visa (i said no). he then offered me $1300 check and i could take my vehicle to the differential shop and have them fix my problem and he would take care of the bill (i said no). i told him i would rather have him refund my money and i would have the fix done some place else. 

after speaking with the dispute team at visa , i brought my vehicle back to advanced transmissions and greg told me he would spend his own money and bring my vehicle to a chevy dealership to get diagnosed. i guess the dealership diagnosed the noise as my transfer case. when i picked up my vehicle the second time, my new invoice (to rebuild my transfer case) was $2643. greg said i did not owe any money because it was covered under warranty. included in the warranty charge were parts and labor. as soon as i left the shop i stopped and put the vehicle in 4x4 and back to 2wheel drive, the service 4x4 light came on. i drove back in the shop. after about 40 minutes i was told the problem was fixed. as soon as i left the shop i repeated the same thing i did and the light came back on. i once again pulled back into the shop and asked greg if he wanted me to take my vehicle to a place that knew what they were doing and he yelled  ""fine, take it to the dealership"" and went into to his shop and started yelling profanities and throwing stuff. i took my vehicle to the dealership and was diagnosed as a speed sensor.

unaware i still did not have a warranty, i was waiting for the warranty to run out before filing with az small claims court. i decided to file before the warranty ran out (it's a good thing i did.) it was in court i found out greg decided not to honor my nationwide warranty. in court greg admitted that he knew what my problem was (grinding noise) and could not fix it. 

i won my case.

this transmission shop and owner is known around town. don't make my mistake, ask around."
284,negative,"this meineke location took advantage of a sad situation, did not listen to what i described as the problem, failed to diagnose a serious issue, and didn't perform services as agreed. they charged be me over $1,500 despite their acknowledged failures, leaving me out of that money with a vehicle that can only be sold for junk. 

after my father died suddenly on christmas, i was left with his 1997 ford aerostar van that he'd let fall into disrepair. the vehicle did not feel safe to drive, as the engine died at stoplights, the check engine light was on,  and the vehicle felt like it was lurching or lunging forward when i first started the car, but not after it had been going on the freeway.

i took the vehicle into this meineke on chandler blvd, and brandon, who worked at the front desk, listened to me describe the problems listed above. i said that i wanted to get the vehicle safe to drive for a few weeks.

brandon apparently didn't like the word ""lurching"" that i used to describe the problem, because he said it was the engine ""surging."" he hadn't looked at the vehicle at all, but said a surging engine would cause that jerking motion i demonstrated feeling when i drove the car. 

i paid ~$100 for a diagnostic service after having dropped the van off on either january 2 after the new years' holiday, and was helpfully referred to a rental car place across the street at a discounted price so i'd have a vehicle in the meantime. 

it took them a while to look at the car, but brandon called me on the phone and said that to fix the problems, i'd need to pay about $1,500 to fix the intake manifold, change the spark plugs, and do some other work. that was a lot of money to spend on an old van, but it seemed like i could sell a generally working van on cl for about $1,000, so i agreed to do this. i needed a van to be able to transport items from my dad's house to goodwill, etc., as this would be better for the job than a rental car, and i only needed it for a few weeks. 

they didn't fix the van for several days, as i was told they had difficulty finding a new intake manifold for that vehicle, but i picked it up on sunday after they said they'd given it a test drive and the issues described had been fixed.i drove the car about a mile back to the place where i was staying, and didn't immediately notice any changes, although the van's engine didn't feel like it was dying. 

on monday, however, i noticed right away that morning that the car was still lurching - but i needed to get where i was going to several appointments, so i left things alone and tried to gather more data. on tuesday, the problem was still there, of course, so i called brandon to report that things still hadn't been fixed. i still needed a vehicle all day for several days, as i had a jam-packed schedule trying to settle my dad's estate and get his house cleaned out. 

brandon said that old cars often would run the engine fast when first starting up, and that this engine surging was causing the lurching behavior. i told him my frustration that he kept saying ""surging"" - the problem was that the car was *lurching* and jerking. so he agreed that they'd look at the car on saturday morning. 

i brought the van in again in last saturday, january 13, first thing in the morning, and the car still was obviously lurching. i had a mechanic do a test-drive with me so he, too, could feel what was happening with the vehicle. i was given an estimate of $0.00 to fix the problem, which was finally described accurately on the estimate form as ""lurching.""

well, after having it all day, brandon then called me back and said the issue was that the rear brakes were having trouble, but that he didn't know how much it would cost to fix the problem unless he took apart the brakes, which then would obligate him to repair the problem.

i said that the problem had not been fixed the first time, and that this should have been included in the $1,500 i paid. he said that ""there are no guarantees in this industry"" and that he was not going to fix the problem for no money. i said that i was willing to be flexible with him, but i needed to know how much things would cost ahead of time, as i was not willing to be out another $1000+ dollars for repairs. he refused to give even a ballpark estimate for repairs, which, again should have been done the first time. he acknowledged that they didn't catch the problem on the first inspection, but said that my repair goal was to fix only the major issues and get the car to the point where it was safe to drive.

well, i disagree that there are no guarantees in this industry; if you agree to fix given problems for a certain amount of money, then you need to honor that agreement. fixing the brakes is also a safety issue, so that argument doesn't fly either. 

shame on chandler blvd meineke for not doing these repairs as promised and taking advantage of me in a bad situation! they need to make things right."
285,negative,"i had the worst experience at this garage that i have had since i moved to phoenix. exorbitant pricing is the least of the concerns. 
- replaced an air filter i had just replaced 2 weeks previously.
- had to take my jeep back the next day and when i talked to them just a little bit later they tried to blame that problem on me!
- then the next day check engine light came on. plugged in the handy dandy code reader and it was telling me evap and bank 2 o2 sensor 1. sure enough i open the lid and i found 3 vacuum lines not even connected. 1 of which was the top one on the evap canister. just lying there. so either to lazy to finish the job (head gasket replacement) or hey he will come back when the check engine light comes on.
- replaced a battery that didn't need replaced it needed recharged.
and for this lousy job i got shafted for $1400!!!
- add in that they told my girlfriend (when i wasn't with her) that replacing rack & pinion and tie rod ends is general maintenance. so much for female friendly
- $800 to replace her fuel injectors. there's only 6 of them. maybe i just missed the section where we were getting the special platinum coated titanium ones. 

i just have nothing good to say about community tire pros. so i just be quiet now and  hope that this review will help at least one person make the right decision and go somewhere else."
286,negative,based on the reviews i thought this would be a good shop.  they are scam artists.  went in for a check engine light. they told me i needed an oil change that the oil was dirty. i had my oil changed a week prior.  they told me i needed a radiator flush. i had a new radiator put on 2 months prior. then they charged me 322$ to reattach a hose!!!!  these people will try very hard to take advantage of you. don't trust them.
287,negative,"i own a shop and used them to rebuild a transmission for a customer. 2 weeks later it's still not done with every excuse in the book. i talked with jim who is the owner and feels that i should be understanding as to why it's not done. he says hes been doing this for 26 years and it amazes me that he has any customers! its not the the 90's when customers had to wait weeks for repair because there was one repair shop in town. in the mean time my customer of 16 years has told me that they will never come back after this event. typical transmission shop, can't trust a word they say. i will never be back and never refer another customer. they get one star only because i can't pick none."
288,negative,i took my car to this location for a diagnostic on my transmission talk about unprofessional not only did they lose another customer's vehicle while i was there but the supervisor i'm presuming proceeded to yell and scream at the front desk clerk in regards to something that he had done incorrectly i took my vehicle without allowing them to do the diagnostic and won't return.
289,negative,"dealerships are scary places for some people, but since vehicles are expensive, we want the job done correctly, right? i decided to give this place another chance after a bad experience two years ago.

bad customer service! 

this morning, i pulled up and met the advisor blaine. he was a very indifferent and an inanimate young guy. i asked him for two services (two of which i had coupons for): transmission flush and oil change. oil change coupon was for $31 and it stated it came with a tire rotation. when i asked about paying separately so that both coupons are honored and both services are done, he starts breaking down the money the dealership is going to lose on honoring the coupons.

1) invoice time comes; the tire rotation was not done. blaine tells me that what i am paying is ""too little"" money for the service i am requesting. also, rotations are separate. since when do they not honor their own coupons? it really said it on there! he tells me he threw it away, but he did the right thing and sent the car back.

2) why was he so concerned about the money? i understand that as an employee in this society, you have to bring in the money, but what about customer service? and was it something he truly had to explain that way? so many questions! 

i hope you have a better experience than i did."
290,negative,"this happened some time ago, but has bothered me ever since and i feel a need to share it with others as a caveat emptor (buyer beware).

they stole money from my car, and i believe also lied about an unneeded repair.

i brought my car in because of a check engine light that would not turn off and that my regular mechanic couldn't figure out.
once i brought it in, they called me with an 'emergency repair' that my left front tire would fall off if i didn't fix it immediately.  i was suspicious, very suspicious, but either it was true and i was in danger, or it wasn't and they were going to create the issue.  so i said ok and it was a nearly $1200 repair, on a car that was otherwise fine.  oh, and they ""fixed"" the check engine light, not.  

so maybe that was the end of it, but my check engine light came back on.  so i brought it back, and they informed me that it was a sensor above the gas tank and would cost over $2,000 to fix.  i opted not to fix it, but when i returned to get my car, there was money stolen from my car.  i know that to be the case because i had a series of those gold dollar coins.  i used it as a teaching moment for my children about the unfortunate realities of car dealerships, and the stupid mistake their father made for leaving money in the car.  

the problem is that any shop that would steal money out of a customers car is also very likely to lie about a fake and expensive repair.  and my check engine light is still on.  

so some months later i'm in the market for a new car.  and while i love the product, i don't trust that dealership in the slightest.  to steal $10 from a customer's car is costing them potentially thousands in commission from my next purchase, and from any service (if i were to get a lexus elsewhere) ever.  

and frankly i think i'll get a camera for my next car for anytime i bring it to any service shop.  trust destroyed.  thank you bell lexus."
291,negative,"this is the worst place in the world to get a car from. and the sales man was a liar.    i got a ford expedition,  2 weeks later the transmission went out.  and i had to pay for it 2900 out of pocket.  then i was told that my 1st payment was deferred by gary and that wasnt true it was due in 2 weeks.  (not that it was a problem but it was not what i told).  then they made me pay for my registration because they forgot to add it to my loan.   then they lied about the price of the tags and charged me more then the cost.  i saw on my registration.   this is the worst place in the world.  ill never recommend this place to anyway this took place march 2019. do not buy a car from here."
292,negative,"this guy jim is a crook! he quoted me $3000 to ""rebuild"" my transmission today. it didn't feel right when i talked to him face to face. i decided to get a second opinion and sure enough all it need was a speed sensor. saved myself $2700 getting a second opinion, i called jim and told him a speed sensor fixed my issue. he wasn't happy, he cussed my out and told me to never come back. i happily agreed to never come back."
293,negative,"the absolute worst customer service i think i've ever received anywhere was from this buisiness. wish now i never purchased an suv here. the 2nd day i had the car, driving on the freeway and the transmission goes out like completely. had to be pushed off freeway and then towed. called the owner (veronica) about the issue and because the used car law, 15 days/500mi warranty she had to have it fixed. this is where all went to hell. she first tells me oh ya i'll have a new one put in, then days later tells me oh they don't make a brand new transmission for 2011 dodge durango's (which is not true) she thought my self or husband were both dumb i guess idk. then tells me that she can get one from out of state and it is used, but assured me that whatever she gets and replaces that it will come with warranty. she had my car almost 3 weeks, and calls and said it would be ready said date, day comes no car, no answer or text back. then calls back and says oh now the driveshaft is broken. gotta order it from somewhere else cause auto zone doesn't have (which was also false). after 3 weeks, of bad communication with her and the office. the car is fixed, told me several times about whatever she fixes will come with warranty but had yet to give me anything in reference to wareanty. now had car back a little under a week and guess what, transmission slipping and now overheating. i still can't get this warranty info, or even the name of who fixed the transmission to go and talk and tell my newest issue with. veronica has not responded to calls text nothing to either me or my husband. nobody in het office seems to be able to do anything, apparently she can only handle simply giving me what she promised of the warranty. now i'm stuck with a broken car and a finance payment. just wanted to buy a car to drive to and from work and some reason she scams me and gives me a fucked car she knew was no good. and all the while making me out to be the bad guy. this lady should not even be allowed to sell remote control cars let alone real ones. buyers beware she is shady as they come!!!!!!!"
294,negative,this is the worst place to bring your car i had transmission work done on my car came home had the same problems took it back they said i have 820 misfires full o shit i took it to 2 different places no misfires what's so ever no my car dosnt go in gear they said i have warranty when i called he said he's gonna charge me to fix the problem the caused on my car the worst place ever don't go there greg is full of bogus he dint fix anything they said 900 when i went they charged me 1500 bucks they are lies
295,negative,"we started with a frame off restoration of our truck last september (2013).  the guy who accepted the truck and started the work gave us a quote which was supposed to include ""everything"" and he promised it by christmas.  when we arrived one day to check on it, it was indeed taken apart with parts all over the newly recovered seats we had done previously.  we asked they be removed and boxed.  each month we stopped by, nothing was done.  christmas came and went and the truck was no where even close to being ready for paint.  this original guy quit, left or was fired - never sure what happened and it was turned over to the second person.  still very slow progress.  we ordered several thousand $ worth of parts and delivered them, along with an inventory, to the shop.  the original bid was increased (with our approval) to include an overhaul of the transmission and painting of the chassis.  i could detail the rest of the story but will give the final result.  on july 3, the car was delivered to us with a dead battery.  we actually think they had to jump it to get it to us it was so dead.  the body work and paint are wonderful.  they did a fabulous job with that but many of the parts we had delivered ended up going missing and we had to replace them.  the drivers arm rest paint was cracked.  driver door rubbed against the trim on the fender so much we had to redo the whole thing.  the inside dome light is not working.  the temperature gauge is not connected.  tailgate latch is not stable and has had to be reworked.  we have had to replace the glove box, starter, new water pump, timing was off by 24 degrees, and the heater hoses were put in wrong.  the handle for the ash tray was missing.  this is a short list of the problems.  had these problem existed before they got it, that would be different but they didn't.   there is no excuse for parts not working as we were willing and able to buy new parts whenever asked and did so many times over so we would get the truck back in like-new condition.

we would never go back there - it is our fault for not getting an itemized list of what was to be done but the original guy was a schmoozer.   we were naive in not getting an itemized list of what was going to be done right from the get go but when you spend this much money on a job, you would think that the little things would be perfect.  we really believe the paint and body guys really know their stuff but the management  and attention to detail is where they are lacking."
296,negative,"terrible service. transmission is still bad, not reverse after over $2600.  did not honor warranty, instead charged me $183.00 for wheel bearings, which i did not authorize. took him 4 days to do this. ray did not even call me to tell me he was putting in wheel bearings.  no excuse, just said, i guess i should have called.   i told him that it still doesn't go in reverse.  he said nothing wrong with transmission.  so now i am out not only the 2600.00 - (which was supposed to be half of that on the phone) i am now out another $183.00 and still reverse does not work. going to take it elsewhere."
297,negative,"my 76 year old father of 5 and vietnam veteran took his truck here for service. they took advantage of his memory failing and changed parts that were brand new and changed by a family member, spark plugs and wires not to mention engine oil transmission fluid etc. all this was done less than 500 miles before taking the truck to peoria ford. we spoke to the service manager and they were unwilling to do anything and could not answer why they replaced brand new parts. i drove by this eye sore today and they have a military truck parked on the corner with american flags. i almost threw up! my dad along with several other men and women risked their lives for our freedom and this dealer has the nerve to have military vehicles as advertisement when they rip veterans off!? i'll be calling them in the morning and giving them a piece of my mind."
298,negative,"where do i even begin with pinnacle nissan?  in december we of 2018 we started the process of purchasing a new vehicle and found what we thought was a great deal on a certified used 2018 pathfinder sl. we started the process online and over the phone as i never commit to going to a dealership prior to doing some pre-work. rates were quoted and promises were made over the phone and this is where the problems began. my wife and i went in to the dealership in the evening and started the process. fast forward to the following weekend and we are finally going in to sign the docs for the car we had in our possession for a week at this point and this is where the major problems begin. the rate was 5% more than what was stated in the initial sales meeting. the sales manager at the time, a man by the name of bob, was the one who had quoted the maximum rate without actually having anything to do with the finance department, which is illegal due to multiple regulations regarding quoting rates.  given that i have worked in the financial services industry for 16 years i immediately called them on this and the panic set in from their staff. they worked for an hour and finally secured a rate that magically lower than the lowest rate quoted by bob initially. it is amazing what can happen when you point out the flawed business practices they were engaging them in and educating them on the risks of reputation risk. 

alrighty...so we got everything handled and were told we would get a $300 visa gift card after the new loan funded given the sheer amount of hassle we had been in. the sales manager, bob, even came in and asked that i not ""blow him up"" online or anything since they had been able to get everything taken care of. i agreed at the time given i felt we had come out on top despite a week long hassle and terrible communication from everyone at pinnacle. that brings me to today. not only was the $300 visa gift card never honored as they ""had no record"" of that being promised but bob was no longer with the dealership within weeks of our purchase. 

despite the pathfinder being a 2018 and certified used we have had to have three major repairs completed. 1. the front collision sensor failed within the first two weeks and had to be replaced. 2. a valve had to be replaced in the transmission that had failed and was causing the vehicle to lag immensely in accelerating. 3. a new gear shift assembly had to be installed due for that failing as well. now we have to contemplate purchasing an extended warranty due to our constant worry that pinnacle not only screwed us out of our valuable time and $300 but also sold us a lemon to boot. in no way do i feel that this is a reflection as a whole on nissan i can say unequivocally that pinnacle nissan should not be patronized by anyone that reads this review. i will be contacting the bbb to share my thoughts with them about all of this given the multitude of reviews that seem to echo, if not completely match, our experience with this dealership. they are most certainly not the pinnacle of anything in this consumers mind. avoid at all costs."
299,negative,"the lady at the front desk was very kind. however, the mechanics did a horrible job on my oil change service. i had a qpon from my job that included a tire rotation with the oil change. the mechanics lied and said my rotation could not be done because my front tires were old. i believe they were upset that i was only getting an oil change and turned down the offer for a transmission flush. i overheard the front desk lady ask a customer on the phone if he/she wanted a transmission flush. when she told the mechanics that the customer said yes, the guys started cheering and making noise as if they had just won a prize. i went to discount tire and they told me i still had a lot of tread on tires and rotated my tires for for free since i purchased them there. also, the oil change at aaa included refilling my fluids. i knew i needed more windshield wiper fluid before i pulled in. they checked-off that it was completed. pep boys refilled that for me and told me i needed a new wiper blade. very disappointed with their dishonesty and will never return again!"
300,negative,"do not ever take your vehicle to this company & especially not to this specific location on mcdowell!!! this is not a professionally ran mechanic shop at all & they have the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my entire life!!! 

i had an extended warranty from red shield that was covering my transmission repair//rebuild and for some insane reason they decided to send my vehicle to this dirty junkyard... (literally a dirty junkyard) i'm assuming because they completely cut every corner they can find & their ""manager"" sean lies through his teeth constantly making up ridiculous excuses & putting the actual owners  of this company in some huge liability that will most likely result in a lawsuit we have prepared. 

long story short... this company//location did a horrible rebuild on my transmission that went out again after 9-10 months... my extended warranty said that they ""never received the proper paperwork proving my transmission was rebuilt properly""... after having porsche do a full diagnosis they gave me a report saying ""whoever rebuilt this transmission has absolutely no idea what they are doing & should never work on your engine again""!! 
after more investigation i realize that this crooked company cuts every corner they can by using all the cheapest fluids they can find even & then lied to me & the warranty company saying they ""used all the proper porsche fluids""... well after throwing the porsche parts department a cash tip they were able to pull every single purchase receipt that their shop had ever made proving all their lies again & that's when i decided to get my personal attorney involved to start a lawsuit against this company. 

after talking more with the manager//front desk attendant sean he said that ""his owners didn't want a lawsuit and would fix my transmission for free""... after weeks of excuses and bullshit i finally get a call that it's repaired exxxxxxcept for all the electrical wiring is fucked up and not working... and tried to go on the most pathetic rant about how it definitely wasn't their fault and blah blah blah.... i had it towed from that junkyard immediately right back to porsche for another diagnostic so i could easily prove in court what condition the vehicle entered the super discount transmission junkyard, and then get another report done afterward to legally prove exactly what they did and how their mechanics are absolutely some of the worst in this valley.

now to top this entire story off... they still will not provide me any paperwork at all proving this was rebuilt properly the second time!!!! it blows my mind... i'm trying to remove their liability so my warranty will pay when this shotty transmission breaks again (i can already feel it doing weird stuff) soooooo do not ever take or send any vehicle to this location!!! 

**if your an owner of this company i would suggest getting in touch with me directly instead of talking through your front desk attendant ""sean"" who is not only making your company look horrible to everyone involved with this situation, but is also placing a ton of liability on your entire operation with his ridiculous replies full of lies & unwilling to even send over a basic customer invoice proving the vehicle was repaired properly!!"
301,negative,"avoid this repair shop!  they will rip you off.  i brought my vehicle in because the check engine light was on and the car began to idle rough, almost shutting off.  all tune and lube diagnosed the problems.  they recommended tune-up, o2 sensor changes, mass flow sensor changes.  after the work was done, i paid the invoices.  upon taking receipt of my car, the check engine light and rough idle condition still persisted.  i returned many times, giving them an opportunity to fix the problems which they were paid for.  i was assured that my car would be repaired. 
 after several failed attempts, i had to take my care elsewhere.  when i asked for a refund, they refused.  i asked for a refund again and still no refund.  all they did was sell me parts and inconvenience me.  i'm very frustrated, disappointed, and dissatisfied.  do yourself a favor and find a more reputable shop for your repairs."
302,negative,"bought a 2016 528i white bmw a few months ago but they sold me a car with a expired smog test.  took the car to get the smog check done my self. paid $21.95 and the car didnt pass the smog check because the regulator for ac had a problem. i got pretty mad and took the car to the dealership  and asked them why did they sold me a car that cant pass a smog.  they didnt even apologize that the smog paper was expired and told me to bring the car in for a repair. had the car repaired in couple days and got it registered at the dmv.  i'm pissed that they didnt reimburse me for the smog check i paid for when i bought the car and the fact that i wasted my time at the dmv with a expired smog paper.  this could have handled differently if they did their job.....when you buy your car here, make sure all your documents are correct because they could care less!!! im wondering if i could sue for this."
303,negative,"i went back and forth if i should write this or not, but others need to be advised bringing their mazda here for service. (i bought my car here brand new from this dealership back in november 2017)i brought my vehicle in for routine service in december 2018, they said everything was okay but there was a leak in my water pump, that it was covered under warranty and they would replace it. cool no problem. they had my car for a week while replacing said pump and when i got my car back i instantly noticed it had now started making a noise that was never there before when i brought it in to them to have the pump replaced. my husband calls back and tells them, they take my car back for another week and said they needed to contact mazda to see if they can replace my transmission( on a car that is one year old with 23k miles), they approved the replacement of the transmission and had my car for 2 week, in total over a month they had my car. i get it back after they replace the transmission and what do you know, it's making the same exact noise. they had a mazda certified tech look at it and say ""it's normal"" and that is it. they didn't say why it was happening, where it's coming from at all, just said it's normal and threw us out the door. fast forward to today, my husband went in and he was in for maybe 10 minutes speaking with the general manager and the service manager and they pretty much told him ""look we told you there is nothing we can do"" and was extremely unprofessional about this entire situation. what is going on with my car is unacceptable, this is not normal, it's all i hear when i drive all the time, music won't even kill it. we will be looking into finding an attorney to help us figure this out because they can't even tell us what the hell the noise is and where it's coming from and why... who does that? we are extremely unhappy with all of this. don't ever buy from here. go to chapman mazda instead."
304,negative,"i was told at a previous service that i needed a new battery. when i later returned with the paperwork proving the battery was under warranty i was inconvenienced by having to wait several hours while the battery was load tested. i feel that the service writer was trying to sell me a battery when if he checked my service records he would have seen that i purchased the battery at findlay. he also recommended two other services that were not necessary: transmission service and brake fluid exchange. if he had checked my records he would have saw that my transmission was not due for service. i went to a reputable brake service shop and was told that brake fluid is not changed due to being discolored, but on whether there is water in the fluid. they tested my brake fluid and it did not need to be changed. i am starting to lose faith in findlay's service department since ryan wolff left. i have been deceived and am losing trust in your service department. no one bothered to respond to my last negative review, so i am not confident anyone will follow up on this bad review. i was very upset after my last service. when i returned home engine oil was leaking on my driveway due to a careless service tech. they did not divert the used oil and it puddled on my skid plate. my driveway is at an angle and when i parked my truck, the used oil made a mess on the driveway. i was worried that there was a greater problem and returned to the dealer to be told that the tech caused the mess. my driveway now has oil stains that will not go away. i have had several years of very good service at findlay, but am starting to consider other options due to a lack of trust and confidence. if no one contacts me it will make my decision easy."
305,negative,"clearing check engine lights just to sell the car and when told about the issue they will either not call or email you back an when they finally do they tell you to accept it or leave it. even after them telling me to my face and shaking my hand that ""they will do whatever to help us with any issues"" thats a quote straight from the sm mike jackson himself. my family has been coming here for years to buy cars, parts and service and now will be going somewhere else due to the poor practices they are doing trying to sell cars that are not fit for anyone. clearing cel's just to sell a car is something a buy here pay here off main would do, not a well known now bought out dealer should do. i just wish we could just give our sales women adriana something for her time and money lost."
306,negative,"took my car in for a gasline repair, came out with a detached muffler. yay."
307,negative,"this is an example of a stereotypical rip-off crooked mechanic establishment. mind you, i'm not mechanically inclined and my knowledge on fixing cars is limited to changing a tire. therefore, i require a high level of ethical behavior and trust in my mechanic. this is not the shop to go if your situation is even remotely like mine. 

a couple of months back, i brought my toyota highlander in with the primary complaint that the check engine light was on and i needed it fixed in order to pass emissions. $650 later they fixed my power steering (and seemed to do a good job, to which i give them credit) and provided an explanation that the check engine light were off for now, but that the vehicle needed about $1200 of additional work to permanently turn off the check engine light. this didn't make sense to me as the laundry list of alleged issues aren't ones that are typically involved in causing such lights to appear, according to my research and expert opinion from a mechanic friend. sure enough, the light came on 2 days later, and since the vehicle was returned to me on a friday, this made a trip to emissions impossible. 

fed up, i eventually got smart and went to autozone; ironically the one located in the same complex off of mcclintock. in less than 5 minutes, a friendly gentleman informed me that that the source of my check engine light appearing was 6 codes..... but, all 6 codes were for the same issue: the gas cap seal! $13.99 later, all codes were cleared and my vehicle was able to pass emissions. 

in summary, i will never give sundevil auto my business again and will proactively inform as many individuals as possible about my experience. i feel that if you go in there as a single female (who happens to not have a prior knowledge of engines) they see a $$$'s over your head and lack the moral conscience to treat you ethically."
308,negative,"a couple weeks ago, i brought my car in for a transmission check due to check light on. after waiting for 7 hours they're worker webster finally comes to me and lets me know its a sensor that had to be ordered. webster explained that the car was ok to continue driving. in these weeks that i'm still waiting for this mysterious car part, other things are going wrong. everything is sensor related, yes i'm back at chevrolet now. i spoke with webster about the new sensor issue. i was instructed i might have to pay for this visit, i questioned the bill due to the sensor that relates to the other sensor. the car is like a human body, you don't fix one problem and it will start to affect the rest of the body. well chevrolet workers claim otherwise. after a lengthy conversation with webster, i explained and we agreed that the sensor is covered under warranty but not the ac. we also agreed that it was there workers that told me to continue to drive without the completion of my car visit. in my camero, the ac doesn't work without the sensor!!!! with that said they still want me to sign for a possible bill that is clear and cut where the issue is stemming from, sounds like someone is trying to make money off innocent drivers that trusted their company. 

i can't wait to hear there explanation around my sensor and what they're going to do. i must say, this is the worst i've heard of in my 35 yrs. sucking money from loyal customer's reflect on the company being down in stock. 

as i wait in the lobby for another follow up, i will write another review with there final judgement call."
