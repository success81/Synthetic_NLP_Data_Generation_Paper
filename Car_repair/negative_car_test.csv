1,negative,"i can't tell you how angry i am right now.  i went to huntersville ford yesterday to get an oil change on my commuter car.  paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.
today i had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  as i was getting off of i-85, i noticed the smell of burning oil.  i thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  i didn't hit a stop light until i was almost at my office.  when i stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and i had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.
i pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  i popped the hood only to find the technician did not put the oil filler cap back on!!!  now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course huntersville ford is closed today!!!!
i have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.
i called and left a voicemail, and now i have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so i can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  i will hold huntersville ford responsible for any components that fail as of a result of this.  most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  in fact, i'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.

and no, i did not have other work done... just the oil change.  you had 1 job.... oil change.  no transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.  i hope he remembered to tighten the filter, but i am skeptical at this point.

i can assure you, i will not be taking my car back to that dealership, even though it is right around the corner from my house.  make it right, huntersville ford."
2,negative,"they're working on fixing the problem of the check engine light on the car, hopefully it will get figured.out soon and the issue will be resolved and the check engine light will stay off and the car will run good

fly by night mobile mechanic didn't show when he said he would. several messages left at the car company with no return call as well as a text to an employee with no response. this place sucks and couldn't careless about customers"
3,negative,"my girlfriend just got an oil change done here, she asked that they check the car over because we are going out of town. it is roughly a 100 miles later, 12:21pm, and we stopped for gas. the transmission fluid(measured hot and with the engine running) is not even showing on the dip stick, the belt cracked pretty bad, all the fluids are low there isn't a drop of washer fluid and who knows what else they didn't bother to check."
4,negative,"i bought a audi 4 and it was the worst car i ever bought...check engine light consistently keeps back on, the owner  jacob ""tried "" fixing but couldn't,so i end up fixing it myself with a little research. the car came with a spare tire that was flat,less then a year the rear back window went out,glove compartment hinges broke,fuel gas leak and til now check light still lighting up . before you buy any car,trucks or suv make sure you check every single details on the vehicles and ask for carfax or call your car insurance for a carfax. the audi a4 i bought is a lemon car."
5,negative,"took my transfer case here after talking to jeff over the phone.  seems like a legit place but the work done was half assed.

i brought it in because of a squeaking noise and a rattling sound.  i rebuilt it prior and thought it would be good for a professional to take a look at it.  they couldn't find the problem but told me the best they could do was a bearing kit for $550.  it would take a knowledgable person no more than two to three hours for the job and the kit is about $90 on ebay.  that's a lot of money for labor and they did a sloppy job.

first of all i had to take it back because they spray painted the front of the case where the transmission fluid from the transmission will come into contact.  i had to argue with jeff that i didn't want paint there.  he finally said to take it back and he'll remove it.  also a half assed job because there was still paint that i had to remove myself.  sorry i don't want cheap spray paint dissolved in my transmission.  not to mention the case was brand new and they did not have to paint it.  they also did a poor job spray painting it as they didn't use any masking.(see pictures)  the spray paint is also flaking off.

now i'm about to put the case back in my truck and i check to see if they put the magnet back.  they did not.  now i have to take it back apart and put one back in myself.  more work for me when i paid a professional to take care of it.  also they put too much rtv around the case which the manual says not to do because it could clog up the screen to the oil pump and burn out the bearings.

very poor and unprofessional job by a place that call them self ""pro.""  skip this place and find some one who cares about their work.



*talked to jeff over the phone.  initially, on our very first coversation, he seemed very knowledgable about transfercases.  it become apparent after each conversation his knowledge is very limited.

i told him about the problem and he didn't offer a refund not even an apology, just tried to argue and justify himself.   i hope you think twice before taking your car here.  places like this also give a bad name to good mechanics."
6,negative,"terrible they took advantage of my elderly  mom. they did not even address what she went in for. however, she left after paying $800.00 and her check engine light is still on, so no emissions test for her today their explanation  "" we only do one thing at a time"" what a sorry states of affairs."
7,negative,"this is an update to a previous review. we took our car to another shop to make sure we were not out of line in our suspicions of this location. they were skeptical of what we said. in particular, that any shop would return a car to a customer with a new check engine light and not tell them about it. however, after they looked at it, they agreed and were appalled at the condition our car was returned to us. apparently our car was the talk of the shop because all the mechanics could not believe our car was returned to us in such a way. breather hoses left unattached, the plug in to the car computer pulled out and left dangling, and every single code on our check engine light a result of something they left undone. i've never had a shop tell me to bill another shop for the work they did, but that's exactly what happened here. do not take your car here. they will screw you over big time!!!!-"
8,negative,"just had my truck in for service and they made no mention of the inspection results.  come to find out, the front brakes were down to nothing and should've been replaced at the oil change.  they have been replacing the egt sensors on my f250 at no charge since buying it new in 2013 because it had a service bulletin on it.  now, they won't honor the service bulletin and it's my responsibility.  i've only been taking it in every 7-10,000 miles because the check engine light is on, due to their inability to fix the problem on the supplier-side...but it's now my problem.  also, because of the dealership just slapping new egt sensors on the vehicle, the dpf system needs replaced.  this vehicle only has 124,000 miles on it.  there's no excuse to have to put $8,000 worth of repairs into it.  peoria ford, ford as a manufacturer, and their service representatives are some of the worst i have seen.  they don't advise on anything.  just fix the codes, oil changes, or tire rotations, and send the vehicles on their way. no service at all!"
9,negative,"do not get your car serviced here. take it to another certified land rover repair shop. i took my car in for it's 90k mile service and inspection on june 6, 2018. they recommended i install a new drive shaft and a couple of small issues, but no other major issues.  i planned on keeping the car for a long time so i did all the work they suggested for a total of $2,742. one week after i had the car serviced the water pump failed and caused the engine to over heat. in other words i had major engine failure one week after having the car serviced and an additional repair bill of $2.203. it's now june 26th, 2018 and my check engine light is on. i took it to the dealership and they told me i blew a gasket head when the car over heated. i got an estimate from another repair shop for $6,500. my decision now is to have the car repaired or trade it in for it's scrap value. on june 5th, 2018 i had a perfectly fine running car with no issues, but after $5,000 in repairs and service from land rover las vegas my car is now junk. 

on another note i brought my car in for minor service back in 2016. when the work was complete i went to pick up the car and it was leaking gas under the engine. i'm not talking a few drops of gas, but a full stream of gas was leaking from under the car. it probably leaked about 3-5 gallons in front of the dealership before they could get it to stop. i should have known how crappy their service was then and never used them again."
10,negative,"i've been a customer of their service center for the past 4 years. i've always enjoyed working with my service adviser and felt as though i was taken care of, even if there were mistakes made. during a recent call to schedule my regular oil change i was informed that they opened a new ""quick service"" center at the dealership for such services. great! or so i thought. upon arrival i met my 'new' service adviser for these services. sat for over an hour and half waiting to get my oil changed?!? when my service adviser came back in to get me...nope, he was just coming to tell me all of the other things they wanted to service on the car. i had already listened to this same talk with 2 other customers sitting in the waiting area. they had not even completed my oil change yet. i understand that there is recommended maintenance work based on mileage & age of a vehicle, but why aren't they letting people know up front that these are recommendations?! waiting for 90 minutes (when i had a scheduled appointment) to find out the items, like air filters, transmission flush, etc is recommended as well, is pretty ridiculous and poor customer service.

one of the items recommended was a 'transmission flush' which i decided was worthy of coming back for to have completed. i emailed my service adviser multiple times about the service and cost to make sure that they would be doing an actual flush and not just a fluid change. he assured me that it would be a flush. when i pulled up to have the service completed he informed me that this was a flush and not a service. so, just the fluids would be changed. argh....seriously? this is common industry terminology folks. a fluid change and a flush are not terms that are used interchangeably. they are not the same service and the cost that henry brown buick, gmc wanted for the actual work of a flush was no where near comparable to what other automotive centers charge. i drove away. 

not only has my service adviser (scott usher) been replaced, but they have brought on new people that aren't even that well versed in their own industry. disappointing on so many levels. i like my buick just fine, but without the option of a different dealership, located within in a reasonable distance, to work on it for warranty and basic service needs, i don't think i'll be keeping this vehicle anymore. 

although they may think they are adding value to the customer by having this quick lube center, it has added nothing positive to my experience with this dealership's service center."
11,negative,"my car had a leak and started slow. i paid $1100 for this to be fixed and they were not. i took a day off work to have my car repaired at keffer. it has an oil leak and is starting sluggish. they quoted $1133.40 to do a fuel line flush and to fix the leak. after having the repairs completed and paying i went to my car where it did not start...still on the lot! we went inside and they said we could leave it but since i have to work for a living that was not an option. friday was the earliest i could return. wednesday i get up for work and low and behold there is oil on the ground, thursday fresh oil on the ground, friday fresh oil on the ground. justin had called and said that they would have a loaner car there and ready for me. when i arrive curtis seems to know nothing about this and we end up being there for 35 minutes and he then says we have to fill it back up to where it was on gas or we will be charged $6 a gallon. um, no considering if the job was done correctly the first time i wouldn't need a loaner car and i'm already burning up my gas running back and forth to huntersville from concord. so curtis eventually calls telling us that it needs a fuel pump and that it will be $580 and that they can't find a leak and think it's just ""excess oil"". this is unacceptable. so we speak with justin who first offers us a $150 credit then a $220 credit. really? we just paid for $1100 worth of services we didn't need and we are expected to pay another $360 to $580 in charges again to maybe get the job right this time? then when i go into the service department to pick up my car, i am in the middle of speaking with curtis and a salesman comes running in and rudely cuts off our conversation so he can say ""i'm about to sell this car can you have it ready by 5?"" really? i've already wasted 2 days here and now i have to waste another 10minutes because this rude salesman can't wait his turn? from the first time i drove a jetta i loved it. all of the people i encountered had been great and i always said i would drive nothing other than a vw and my teenagers 1st car would be a vw but after this experience my opinion has drastically changed about vw. this will be my last vw. i want nothing to do with the service department and anything period with vw. we have a mechanic that we know and trust but i wanted to take my car to a vw service department and what i feared happened....i was screwed out of my $1100 and my car still doesn't function properly"
12,negative,"not sure where to begin with this story which happens to be 100% true and happened on august 23, 2014.  first to just get it out of the way robert ostos the general sales manager and this dealership are totally unethical, untruthful and irresponsible.  do not ever buy a car from these people ...they lie.  after meeting mr. ostos in the lot he talked me into test driving the pop 500 ... i did just  that and decided it  could be a car for my daughter if the price was right.  i  went in to their office and they offered me the car for 14,000 new 2014 ....i countered with 13,200 and after a while they accepted my offer ...except the same car i test drove was being sold to a couple sitting 4 feet from me....and the car is longer available and they  have no other auto-matic transmissions to sell.  but they would find me a used car with low mileage ..except the 3 used cars (2012's) all had more than 35,000 miles.  after aimlessly walking around the lot with a new sales guy on the job for the first day....he found a  2015 and again after another delay came back with  the key and an offer of $21,000 more then a 50% jump from the previously accepted offer of 13, 200.  they basically just waited for us to leave not caring one bit  about the underhanded treatment ...my guess is the other older couple was willing to pay full price and they decided to sell  the car out from under us....  shameful.  i found another  dealer in the lv area and the same car and  dealt with one of the most professional teams i have ever  bought a  car from.  in las vegas ..towbin fiat on jones ave off sahara...did the deal in less then 2 hours out the door.  very professional and honest.  they do  not work on commissions  its all about customer service!!!  never buy a car from findlay fiat ...you will regret it.... unless you like to deal with shady characters."
13,negative,"fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice . . . let me start by saying i applaud woodie's for doing a freon fill before suggesting more expensive repairs on the ac system on my car. still $618 in diagnosis and repairs later and my car still isn't fixed. one member of the staff was rude, condescending and arrogant. in the past we had taken a car for repair, and while it was repaired properly, my wife felt like they were rude and condescending. regardless it's our neighborhood garage so we figured we would give it another go.

we brought the car in for three issues, ac not cooling, check engine light, and a tire problem. the only thing we were not prepared to do was buy a new set of tires. after the diagnosis, they called me back with estimates to do a dyed freon fill (to diagnose a leak in the system), four new tires and to fix the problem causing the check engine light. it would appear though that the person i spoke with to approve the repairs took my rejection of the tires as ""don't repair the check engine light either"" and thin sing-songily informed my wife when she came to pick up the car that i knew better than he when it came to fixing cars. there was a note on the invoice that the ""repair"" may not keep the light off which of course it didn't because it wasn't in fact repaired."
14,negative,"i'm so frustrated with this place! i used them previously and had a great experience, so when i needed my car repaired again it was the fist place i went. the customer service has been terrible, and i was quoted for a repair that went from $165, to $500 and now i'm told over $3,000! i can choose to not pay for the additional repair but then my car will not come back to me and have correct placement on the front bumper. really!!! it's 2 weeks before christmas and i have no idea what to do, i don't have $3,000 plus to spend, but my bumper fit on the car fine when i dropped it off and now it will have a gap. do yourself a favor and take your car somewhere else."
15,negative,this place replaced my  transmission and now i have both an engine light on and the ignition tumbler is completely butchered. they even wrote on the key that the ignition key was in the ignition and that the key that was given to them was the key for the door. stay away from this place unless you want more problems than good.
16,negative,"last year i brought my car there for service asking for a transmission flush because i didn't know how long it's been since the car- previously owned had one and i felt as if the transmission was slipping.  i've had cars in my days to know when the transmission is going out.  at only 70k i had to get a new transmission for my 2007 vw jetta wolfsburg edition.  my point is, i went to them with these exact statements, instead they steered me into an $1100 worth of ""maintenance"" that would fix my driving problem.  it didn't fix the problem, so i had to go back the next week to get a new transmission which was $4000.  i think as a female i was taken advantage of, even though i had specific reasons that it was my transmission.  the two pieces of paperwork that i have makes no sense.  the first one, it said customer concerned about transmission- found no transmission problem.... second paperwork, customer concerned about transmission- needs new transmission.  justin beardley the manager did not ever apologize to me and he did not accommodate me even after i emailed vwusa.  so, i will not be buying another vw.  i am not buying from keffer.  instead i am going for something else that gives better service and have better resale value.  thank you keffer vw!  merry christmas to you justin!"
17,negative,beware!!! make sure you know what youre paying for! in the time spand of a year i've taken my car into brake master twice and both times they changed my transmission fluid and charged me over 100 dollars. i later found out that transmission fluid only needs to be changed every 50-60k mikes yet they found it necessary after 2k. what they told me was a complete lie.
18,negative,"the salesman was not pushy  and was nice,but the quality of the car left lots to be desired.t he check engine light kept coming on after i bought it.the repair tech said it was a bad coil.they did replace all 8 coils,(which took them 4 days) and somehow managed to put 400 miles on my car while taking it to the ""dealer"" to be fixed.after finally getting the car back the check engine light came on again!this was after driving it for 20 minutes.when i called to let them know,they gave me attitude and acted like they did me a huge favor by fixing the coils in the first place.car was still under the 15 day 500 mile warranty,so i told them they need to fix it.turned out it was a bad cattaylitic converter.i had to really fight to have them fix it.they tried to say it was probally just a bad sensor.i explained to them that i had a mechanic look at it and it was the converter.so they only replaced one of the 2 converters,and made a big deal about it like i was being unreasonable wanting it fixed!!also it took them a week to fix it!!.t hey had the car more than i did for the during the first 2 weeks after i bought it.i suspect they were trying to let the warranty run out.(hence the 400 miles they put on it,and keeping it for almost 2 weeks).so when i finally got the car back,it seemed alright.little did i know,that they did absoloutely no tune up,service,or oil change like every dealer is supposed to,when you buy.t he change oil light came on 1 day later.i checked the oil and it was low.the car takes synthetic oil,which ranges from $60 to $80 per change.t he battery died 2 days after sale.the repair man lied and said i left the dome light on.i have never even used the dome light because this happened right after i  got it back from the first,in the series of repairs,and had not even driven the car at night,or for more than 4 hours.(since they were the ones in possession of it for ""repairs"").so when i called them to tell them that my battery died,they had the nerve to tell me that ""i can call a tow truck and pay for it myself!!!!!.i refused,and they did end up paying for the tow.all they did was charge the battery and fabricate a story about the dome light being on.at this point,they were getting really rude and nasty towards me.excuse me,but they shouldn't be selling cars with bad batteries in the first place!!!!.and to try and blame me was ridiculous!!!!oh and once i got the car on a lift while i was replacing the bad battery (at $160 might i add).my mechanic showed me how bad my tires were.t he metal was sticking out and they were splitting!!!!all 4 of them!!!!! which i should've noticed earlier,but having the car in my possession so rarely during the first 2 weeks after the sale,and not being able to see the damage until it was on a lift,i somehow didn't notice.so $600 later,i got 4 new tires.as the old ones were 'extremely dangerous""also,the check advanced tracking light recently came on,and will not turn off.my mechanic says its because the wrong vin# is programmed into car.the cars's a lincoln ls,so repairs ,maintenance,and oil changes are not cheap.they should've done all those things when they were supposed to.the last straw for me,was that it took them a month and a half to give me my license plate and registration.everytime i'd call and ask for it,i got yelled at,and told i'll get em.no time frame or estimate or anything!!i was just worried because the temp plate was going to expire soon,and i didn't trust them to get it to me on time.well after i demanded my plates ,i finally got em.but.....i noticed they're only good for 8 months!!!!???wtf???every time i register a car,it's either 1 or 2 years,not 8 months.so i've had the car a little over a month,and have had to put $1000 into it for things that aaron automotive should've done.oh,and did i mention my mechanic thinks the transmission is going???yeah,i def do not reccomend.oh and the car was not even detailed when i very first picked it up after the sale.really?????,aaaron automotive,really????????"
19,negative,"what a shit show... 
i normally would let something like this go but it really bugged me. i drove up and needed a oil change and smog. i spoke to a gentleman in glasses and told him this information. i asked for the usual oil change that included the car wash. he said okay and showed me inside. i need to mention i have a turn to start car and always leave my key near the speedometer. after sitting down and grabbing a drink i was asked about my key, i explained it was in the dash and they just needed to turn to start. he then questioned, are you sure? yes, i am. ugh, whatever it's cool. i then was brought over by another gentleman with glasses to talk about all the things i need and such, they found a leak which was helpful and he said he would be done shortly, so i asked him about the smog. he said and i quote, ""oh, i wish you would have told me that first."" you got to be kidding. i did tell the guy. alright its cool. i told him its gonna get done right... well, the manager, i assume, cashed my out around $40 for the oil change and i asked if it included the smog to which he replied, ""you need a smog?"". you can understand my frustration and the fact i told him to forget it and give me my key. also i don't believe they filled the air in my tires, they are all still low. get it together people. just another quickie lube that doesn't care about customer service.

**update**
i had my mechanic check out my car and there was no oil leak and/or transmission leak, so that means either 1. the don't know what the fuck they are doing or 2. they lied. you tell me what you think......"
20,negative,"beware... this transmission shop is owned by a bunch of crooks. get a second opinion, better yet do not take your car there.  i had my 2005 pathfinder towed there to get an estimate/inspection.  i was initially quoted $1000-$1250 and was told that worst case scenario if there were hard/core parts needed to be replaced it would be $1750. i gave authorization for my transmission to be removed and inspected. i was then quoted $2800 due to a major component needing replacement ""they called it a tcm"".
all parts to my transmission were shown to me in person the next day while the personel explained the issue. i was then shown an exact transmission to an identical pathfinder on the lot which had broken/melted silinoids/valves that was shown to me to make a comparison.  i decided to get a second opinion the next day and asked the shop to load my car as-is.  the shop denied my request and said there was a $1500 tool holding-up my engine and would not let the tow truck driver load my vehicle.  the tow truck driver lefti paid their fee in full $430 for removing my transmission, but they did not want to give me back my vehicle. after an hour of argueing they pushed my car to the parking lot and had 2 employees load the parts on the trunk.  i looked at the parts loaded and they loaded the other broken/melted valve component instead of the correct one. i was very upset when i noticed this and demanded that they give me the correct parts.  they acted as if i didnt know what i was talking about and played dumb.  i locked my vehicle and was about to leave, when the 2 employees came to me and said by the way ""the main drive shaft and about 5-10 other parts"" were not in the trunk.  i let them put the rest of the parts in and left.  the new shop received the car later that afternoon and stated ""they had never seen anything like this before.  needless to say, they forgot to give me the main screws to close-up (put together the transmission) which i had to go back and get two days later because the dealer doesn't just sell these by themselves and when i picked them up, the employee there ""ray"" said ""by the way here's your catalytic converter, we didn't put it in your car"".  they are unorganized, liers and they have 16 complaints (8 this year) already with the better business bureau.   hope this helps someone, this mistake just cost me $3600."
21,negative,"went for an oil change. gabe called and said i had leaking axle seal and power steering line, wanted to charge my wife over $1,000. since i don't have time to maintain my wife's car, i paid it. he also wanted to charge me an extra $250 to change the brake fluid and transmission fluid. i went to a repair shop later, and he said those 2 fluids were ok as is. makes me wonder about the $1k i blew."
22,negative,never come to this auto shop again. my check engine light went on right after an oil change here.
23,negative,this review is long over due. i went there for a smog check and an oil change. they told me that the smoked failed and that the check engine light was on. total lie!!! i keep my truck maintenance and the check engine light was never on. he then started going on with what is wrong with my truck and i stopped him and told him to just do the oil change and thats it. i stood right outside watching every step they did to the oil change because i did not trust them. i will never go back and do not reccommend this place to anyone. the next day i want to smog busters and passed the smog and i did nothing to the truck. stay away from this place.
24,negative,"i took my car to rebel automotive after seeing all the great reviews they had. my car was driving very roughly. when i brought it in they were kind enough to drive me back to my work so i didn't have to sit there. they stated they replaced my compressor, power steering pump and the belt. unfortunately, once they had completed the work, which cost me $1,200, my engine light turned on again after a few days. i took my car to another mechanic for a second opinion and they found that the power steering pump had not been replaced as stated by rebel automotive that they had. also the mass air flow sensor which is connected to the air intake was disconnected without cause and not related to the problems they diagnosed and repaired. this disconnection resulted in a check engine light a couple days later. i am very disappointed by the dishonesty displayed by rebel automotive."
25,negative,"called to make an appointment a few weeks ago to get an oil change and a tire rotation and to get my back tire looked at because it was getting low. they call me about and hour later and i asked ""is my car ready"" the guy said well your front two tires are completely worn down and the metal will be shown through at any moment, at this point is it just dangerous to drive on it and we can't rotate them and you also need a transmission flush. my two tires were not worn down that much and i was definitely in no need of a transmission flush. i've had this car for 1 year. they charged me 500 dollars and when i got there i asked to look at my old tires they took off and they said ""oh the guy already came and got them"" which was a lie they don't haul off tires that fast. when i got into my car the low pressure light was still on so i went back in to ask why, and i stood there for about 10 minutes and nobody came so i left and took my car to a discount tire and they said i had a nail in my back tire that i originally went in there for to get checked out. so this place not only ""recommended"" services i didn't need on my car and they also  didn't even solve the problem that i originally went in there for. all they wanted was their money and they were no help at all."
26,negative,"i urge you to stay away from this dealership and do not call without first blocking your phone number!! 
i purchased my vehicle about 9 months ago. i took it in to be serviced a couple weeks after purchasing it so they could do all of their ""to-do"" list promises. a few days after picking up my vehicle, i notice the transmission and oil light had come on, i advised my service guy (rick) who assured me that all of the fluids had been changed and that the lights would turn off. a week later, my engine blew up and had to be completely replaced ($8000). we were told by another certified kia dealership that there was no oil in my engine and there were also no leaks. the service people at pinnacle likely forgot to replace the oil after draining and we had been driving on fumes. thankfully my warranty covered a bulk of the replacement of my new engine but it took nearly 3 months to replace and pinnacle nissan did nothing for us. 

since our purchase, we have received countless telemarketing calls from various sales people at the dealership. we have asked very politely to stop calling us as we will never do business with them again. however, we have continued to receive calls up to 7 times a week. each time, the sales person assures us that our contact info will be removed. it never is. 

i was contacted again last week by payton and explained to her what the situation was and even after that, she still tried to sell me and buy back my vehicle as if she heard absolutely nothing i pleaded with her!! she finally agreed to get in touch with the head of internet sales to remove my contact info completely. 

i received another sales call today.. in shock i demanded  a manager and was passed to a woman named ""meja""... i explained to her how frustrated i was and she was nothing but rude and unprofessional and didn't appear to care at all so i demanded someone above her. i then spoke to jerimiah and again, explained the situation.. he insisted that i keep getting calls because i call in and the number gets put into the database. i told him that wasn't the case because i don't call in, they call me!!! he looked up my number and said that he will take it out of the system. i told him i do not want to have to change my number which ive had for 7+ years but if i get another call, my husband and i are gonna pursue further action and he hung up on me. 

i cannot believe the level of unprofessionalism and down right lies that occur within this dealership.. even for a dealership, im in complete disgust!

save yourselves the time and trouble of doing business with scum."
27,negative,"complete transmission rebuild on 2/6/13 ($2,349.30)
once car was repaired and picked up a green indicator light was blinking when in d5? i called cottman transmission and the manager told me to bring the car back in for him to look at.
took car on 2/24/13 to determine issue- was told by center manager, andy, that according to the ""code"" it needed a new 4th gear pressure switch part. when i asked him why they didn't see that it needed replacing while they were rebuilding transmission, he stated ""it is not covered under your warranty.""
picked up car on 2/26/13 and d5 light still blinking? i called cottman back and again andy asked me to bring the car back in to see what the issue was? i questioned why they had me pick up the car if the indicator light was not fixed, and they test the repairs made? he had no answer.
with no faith at this time, i took car to hendrick acura on 3/16/13 to determine the issue with the blinking light, although i felt it was all related to the recent transmission rebuild. while there, the technician came to find me and laughingly explained that the cottman technician never plugged the new ignition switch into the computer and that is why it was still blinking? 
i left hendrick acura right at closing and after about two minutes the blinking light still occurring, so i called cottman on that monday, 4/15/13, explained what acura told me about them not plugging the new part into the computer? andy said he would need me to again bring the car back to him to determine the issue and next steps.
i called daily to determine status and how long i would need to rent the rental car for. the manager never called to provide an update.
finally on one of the mornings that i called, andy told me that he had spoken to ""rick"" one of the service managers at hendrick acura and that rick told him it most likely needed a new ecu computer and that it was covered under a recent recall and gave me rick's phone number. when i called and spoke with rick at acura, he kindly explained that this was not at all what he told andy, the recall was something completely non related?
when i called andy back with much less patience at this point, he again told me that it needed a new ecu computer and that it would be another $800 to fix it. he said he would reimburse me for the $121 spent on the new switch that was unnecessarily replaced. he also told me that a used ecu computer would be much less expensive and to have honda to install and program it for me cheaper, but not to tell anyone that i could do it that way? 
when i asked him if i should drive the vehicle during the meantime, he said ""you have driven it this long and nothing has happened, so i think you can go a couple more weeks and be fine.""

i then purchased an ecu computer from toms foreign auto parts on ebay on 4/22/13. they sent me the part. 
i took the computer and my car to honda priority in huntersville on 5/1/13 to get the computer put in and programmed, as andy suggested, and it was informed it was the wrong computer (my mistake). jason gardner at honda asked me why i was replacing it anyway, because the one in the vehicle was a good computer. i explained the entire process to date to him.
i returned that part to tom's and ordered the correct ecu computer from ebay that day ($109).
*on 5/6/13 on the way to work, my car broke down on the side of i-85. i had it towed to honda priority and was told it had a hole in radiator and the engine was burned up. now not sure if any of this is related to the blinking light, the ""bad computer"" the new gear switch not being plugged in, i was distraught.
*i had the new ecu computer put in while at honda huntersville on 5/13 for $220, still going on what andy told me the issue of the blinking light was from. 
*i had the engine repaired at cabarrus import services and picked up on 5/17/13. the manager scott reed told me that the car was running well but that the blinking light was on in d5? i explained what i had been through and told him that i had recently had the transmission replaced. he immediately questioned that and told me that the original transmission casing had not been ""cracked."" when i asked him what i should do, he suggested i call an attorney if cottman did not fix it.
so at this point, i have paid for a total transmission rebuild ($2,349) repaired the switch andy told me i needed- $121.50, i replaced the ecu computer $329 (part and labor) andy told me i needed, meanwhile the engine burned because no indicator lights told me there was an issue with radiator-so it was replaced ($3,311.56), and now the blinking light that started after the transmission was rebuilt at cottman is still occurring? 
i called cott"
28,negative,"let me preface this review by saying that it is replacing a 5-star review.

i've been using usa auto service for about 3 years.  i happened on them when they were just around the corner from my house.  i've spent thousands with them.  including a rebuilt transmission.

my car's engine light came on one afternoon.  the car even shut itself off a couple of times.  i promptly took it to usa auto service where i have traditionally dealt with dave, who is the reason i continued to go there, despite having moved 30 minutes across town last summer.  he wasn't there during this entire experience.

i dropped the vehicle off on thursday, june 28th.  the manager told me that 2 parts needed to be replaced and that it'd be about $600.  no problem.  several hours later, they called.  they informed me that they'd replaced the parts but now the pcm needed to be replaced.  he had a guy in florida who could get it to him for a good price.  he was going to ""overnight"" the pcm to them straight away.  total cost was around $1700 which he said i would have to pay in full straight away.  he said he'd call me the next day to give me an update.

next day came and went - no call.  and so did the weekend.

i decided to phone them late afternoon on monday, july 2nd.  i spoke with the manager and he told me he would get back to me with a tracking number the next day.  i didn't say anything, but the word ""overnight"" gave me the impression it was going to be a relatively quick turnaround.  and now it sounded like the part probably hadn't even shipped from florida yet after 4 days.

next day came and went with no call.  4th of july, of course, was a wash.  i gave them the benefit of the doubt and left them alone until i hadn't heard anything by saturday - nine days after leaving the car with no updates from them.


on saturday, july 7th, i phoned again for the status. i spoke with a manager who said they'd received a pcm but it didn't work so they had reached out for another one.  this didn't give me a lot of faith in the parts from their ""guy in florida"".  but most importantly, all this has been going on and nobody had the thought to call with an update.  i expressly said to the manager, ""can you please just keep me informed if there are delays or problems?!""  ""sure.""

i was starting to see the mo of this re-imagined version of usa auto service.  i made it a point to keep quiet and let them execute their version of customer service without any interference.

it's now monday, july 16th.  a full nine days more after our last conversation.  i'd like to point out that to this point, they haven't phoned me a single time in close to three weeks (except for the initial problem).  it was that morning that they finally broke streak and phoned to ask for my spare key.  they needed it for the programming of the pcm.  why they didn't ask for it prior to this point, knowing the repair they were performing, i can't really make any sense of.  but it seemed par for the course.  thankfully, i still had my original spare key.  on this trip, i gave them a free oil change card that dave had given me sometime back and asked them to provide it while they were finishing up the repair.

another 4 days later on friday, july 20th, the phone rang at 11:30am with a notification that the car was done and ready to be picked up.  after 22 days.  i went over that afternoon to collect the car.  as i was signing out, i asked if they had performed the oil change as i'd requested.  of course, they hadn't...  so, i waited for the oil change i'd asked for days ago.  

the first thing i saw when i started the car was a tire light appearing and the display said ""tire pressure monitor fault"".  i returned to the manager.  he told me i needed to take it to a tire place and have them reset the sensors in the tires.  something one might mention as you're checking out.

so, i did.  big 10 tires checked all the sensors and connectors.  no problems.  it was the pcm.  as you might have expected.  money down the drain.

back to usa auto service on thursday, august 9th.  where i left the car for another week with no contact.  on wednesday the 15th, i called for an update.  they said they'd called and left a message the day i dropped it off that it was done.  odd thing is, my phone shows no voicemail or missed calls.

so, i got the car back today and things seem fine.  of course, i question if the pcm was repaired properly.  or how long it will function...

in closing, i'd like to express that the expense and time are not the things that bother me in this situation.  fixing your car sucks - no doubt about it.  but it happens from time to time.  and you deal with it.  but i will never be dealing with usa auto service again.  they are completely inept at communicating and have zero sense of what customer service is.  

dave - i hope you've left this place.  you're better than this business"
29,negative,"nick is very friendly.
he fixed my car twice with no issues
the third time, he broke a part of the manifold, when he replaced the flex part of the muffler and told me it was broken before, he splashed fresh green coolant fluid under the radiator when i wasn't looking, showed it to me and told me i need a new radiator urgently, he showed me where it  was supposed to be leaking from.
i didn't see anything, he told me he can't teach me the secret of the trade.
my car uses red coolant fluid and it's radiator is just fine.
i miss my old honest mechanic."
30,negative,"if i could give no stars and still review this place, i would! i drove in yesterday to ask the attendant a legitimate question. he was working with another customer so i stayed back and waited until they finished. he never once made eye contact with me though he knew i was there. when he finished with the other car, i approached him to ask what i needed to know and said: ""may i ask a question?"" he replied ""yes"", still not making eye contact! i said: ""if my check engine light is on"" and i paused for a moment because clearly he was annoyed by me. he said, ""that's not a question"". i replied, ""pardon me?"" he said, ""you said you were going to ask me a question, but that was not a question"" seriously trying to push my buttons! i said ""are you serious? you are really copping that attitude with me?"" all this time he was winding up a hose never even looking at me. i said i wanted to know if my check engine light was on if it would affect my outcome. ""he said ""i'll test it for you and you'll find out""  i replied ""then i'll pay you $28.00 and quite possibly fail? he said ""correct"" i replied back to him that i had read some of his reviews and they were pretty bad, and apparently they were spot on! he couldn't have cared less! i told him i was going to leave him a bad review (which i have never done before without using the business first), he didn't care. i told him he was acting like an  a$$ and he had no business working with people! he then called m the b word and went on his way.
don't waste your time or give this place your business! i doubt he owns it, and clearly whoever does is not interested in customer service. there was a blue motorcycle parked there if you see it or him...keep going!"
31,negative,"brought my vehicle in for check engine light (and when you shut the car off the oil light goes on). had approx. $450 work done on the engine, filters, including oil change,etc. check engine light was off for a day then came back on. i told the manager and he said bring it back in.

he ran some codes and told me it needed more work so i would have to have them do a diagnostic. well, they did a diagnostic already (or should have done the diagnostic) when i brought it in the last time and spent the $450. 

i trusted them and gave them one more chance. this time it was $793 for crankcase, fuel pump filter, etc. 

the next day the check engine light came on and when you shut the car off the oil light comes on. car is still not fixed.

called the manager and he said bring it in again. 

you gotta be kidding me really???  either they don't know how to fix this vehicle or are trying to rob me. i think they don't know what the issue is and are clueless how to fix it. either way, now after almost $1,300, my check engine light/oil light is on and who knows what is wrong with it.

i cannot go back to this shop and now have to find another place.

extremely disappointed and unhappy!!!  i even called corporate and they said ""it's all under warranty"". cookie-cutter answer. no one could help me after being transferred to 3 people. 

in, conclusion, the midas shop should have found all issues the first time, let me know what it all was, and fixed everything. not to mention i am really busy and all of the time spent going back was very inconvenient. 

i wish someone in corporate would contact me and send me to a shop that would fix this free of charge and make this right. if not, i am definitely going to spread the word."
32,negative,"my car had an electrical fire under the hood on thursday 4/17 and i had a rental car the next morning and they had my car delivered to me at work on monday morning!!!!!!  

however, i later needed a transmission. i was without a car for several days due to them not being honest with me and letting me know that they had not called the warranty company to request an inspector to come out and look at the transmission to authorize the work. the reason for this was because they had given my car to another company to install my transmission!!!!!!!!!  

i was told that this company zip zap auto was their sister company, and later found out it wasn't .. when i got the rental car from zip zap auto the car was on ""e"". when i tried to call hamid to ask questions about my car he avoided me and had the gate keeper heather blocking all my calls to him. 

i've never done business with an auto repair shop, who gives your car to another shop to repair and doesn't inform the customer about it or even ask the customer???? what's more, you then try to hide your actions by avoiding the customer calls!!!!!! smdh.

was my car fixed by zip zap auto? yes. 
how do i rate busy buggy? sneaky and deceptive."
33,negative,"do not go to peoria ford!!!

for starters we were there from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm and walked out with nothing. i spoke to someone a week before about going into the dealership and had explained our situation. i was told just to come in and i was for sure to walk out with something. i owned a 2013 ford focus and i was having some troubles with it, ford extended the warranty by 2 years on these vehicles because the transmissions are no good so as soon as my car would not go even though it was on drive and i was hitting the gas pedal and after that would not start for at least 5 minutes i took it into the service department right away. once there i was told it would take at least a week to even diagnose it as the transmission department is so far behind with the same vehicles. i was ok with this as long as they would provide a rental vehicle since i do work mon-frid 8-5 and my focus was my only means of transportation they told me no, they could not provide a rental and i would have to pay for it out of pocket. i spoke with managers and even went as far as calling ford corporation and was told no! i just don't don't understand if they are admitting to the issue the car has they should at least pay for a rental. after that the manager in the service department suggested i traded it in. so after talking to someone and scheduling an appointment i was there on saturday early morning in hopes of not being there too late during the buying process. they had us test drive a couple of cars and then had us test drive a truck for which the sales manager beau said would work out perfect for the type of trade we were making. i drove it around the block and completley fell in love with it as did my husband, after coming back we were told ""sorry but i actually plugged the numbers in and it's not going to work"". why would you have us test drive a vehicle you are not even sure we would qualify for?!?! he had the manager in the new car sales department come over and talk to us and he told us flat out there was absolutley nothing he could do for us, when he didn't even try. after that and after being there for almost 5 hours we were tired and aggravated with the type of customer service we were getting so we just left. i requested to speak with the owner pat hickey several times since all these promises had been made to us but nothing was accomplished and i just got the run around, even when we called back later that day offering a higher payment we were told they would call us back but we never did receive a call back, i think we spoke with 5 different people between saturday and early sunday. after all that hassle and pretty much feeling defeated we ended up going down the street to liberty gmc and even though it was a long process since we were making a difficult trade it was definetley worth the wait. we traded in a car and a truck and walked out with a brand new truck and a used car at a great price!! we could not be happier! i am an avid listener of john jay and rich in the morning and kept hearing what great customer service they offered at peoria ford and i have to say i was very dissapointed, i think they only offer great customer service to customers walking in with ""green cash"" as doug told my husband that is what they were looking for. needless to say after the customer service i received there and ford corporate i will never return there or ever purchase a ford vehicle in my life and will never refer someone to purchase a vehicle from peoria ford."
34,negative,"i took my camaro in today to get the oil change done. everything went smooth until the service was completed and when i got in my car the check engine light was on. i went back inside and spoke to alex who came out to check the code. he told me it was on when he got in and i must have brought it in that way. i told him it was definitely not on and it had to be from them. he was very defensive and insulting and kept insisting it was not their fault. he was not even able to explain the code to me and cleared it and sent me on my way. well 15 minutes later the light is back on so i took it too max automotive, which is a great spot. terry took a look at it and after about 15 minutes explained that the oil filter was improperly installed and had pinched the wiring harness nearby and that was the reason for the code. i was relieved it wasn't a major issue, but angry that cobblestone had done a poor job and tried to blame it on the customer. the management needs to take a closer look at how customers concerns are handled. the poor customer service and poor execution of the job has left a bad taste in my mouth. this is the first and last time i will get an oil change here, and i recommend you look elsewhere before coming here."
35,negative,"i regret few things in my life more than my extremely stupid decision to take my vehicle to sun devil for a transmission rebuild.  they quoted me almost $3,000 with a ""$150 coupon applied"" (what a joke).  i elected to settle up to get my car released to a more honest repair facility, and to add insult to injury, sun devil charged me four hundred fifty dollars to release my vehicle.  they also took several hours to ""clean everything off"" before putting the parts in a box, forcing the successor mechanic's tow truck to have to leave and come back later, further delaying my repairs when it took several business days just to get an outrageous quote from sun devil.  the successor facility is providing a 2 year warranty and repaired my vehicle in less than 1.5 days for about eight hundred dollars less than sun devil quoted me.  i am sick about the $450 i did not have to spend that i paid sun devil to do nothing but deprive me of my vehicle for several days and disrespect my business with an outlandish quote.  save yourself the heart ache and do not give sun devil auto your business."
36,negative,"if i could apply zero stars, i would, because this place is awful.  

i bought my first car ever from lake norman chrysler in 1994, a chrysler concorde.  the dealership was under different ownership back then.  around 150,000 miles, the car had problems, but that's to be expected.  i had the transmission rebuilt, then replaced (they were still making concordes at the time).  i had 8-10 sensors replaced.  i had a new engine put in.  in 2007, i sold the car to a friend, and with minimal maintenance, the car is still on the road today, at 220,000 miles.  no complaints, despite sinking between $12k-$15k into the car for repairs alone.

i bought another chrysler in maryland in 2007, a pacifica.  i returned to the lake norman area in april, 2011.  i decided automatically, based on my prior experience at lncdj, to go back there for service.  big mistake.

the minor stuff- the car wash bends my front license plate every time it gets washed (5x so far).  there is still dirt on my car.  there is no paper floor mat to keep their dirty shoes from transferring dirt to my carpet.

the big stuff- they are sketchy!  i wanted all 4 brake pads and rotors replaced because at the time of my last service, their own serviceman told me they needed to be replaced.  that, and having sold hondas for 3 years in maryland, i know that those items need replacing every 45-55k miles.  i set an appointment several weeks in advance for an 8:00 time slot.  i reminded them what needed to be done, and asked that they call me if anything else needed work.  they said it would take 3-4 hours.  at 12:00, i called to check on my car.  i couldn't reach my service manager until 1:00, despite him not taking a lunch break-  he was just too lazy to return my call.  

then he proceeded to tell me 'we replaced the two front brake pads like you asked.""  wait, hold up!  i asked for all 4, plus all 4 rotors to be replaced, and it has been 5 hours!  he said, ""you only said the front two brakes.""  so, after getting mad and losing my temper on the phone, he said my car also needed new tires (they are 3 months old!!), my transmission fluid replaced (also 3 months old) and my windshield wiper blades replaced (only 2 weeks ago, and at their dealership).  

i ended up getting 4 new brake pads, two front rotors replaced, two rear rotors resurfaced, and the wiper blades replaced again.  free.  i refuse to pay them any more.  and the shuttle didn't arrive to pick me up until 2:00, making this an all-day affair.

the other major issue:  i needed an oil change last week, and i purchased a service package from them that included 3 free oil changes, so i have no choice but to return unless i want to pay full price somewhere else (i'm debating doing just that).  i went back on a friday because i also had received a piece of mail saying i won something, come in to claim my prize.  yadda, yadda.

now, i used to sell cars, mind you.  i know how salespeople are, and i know how a lot of people view them, especially car salespeople.  well, this ""free prize"" apparently included going on a test drive, giving them lots of personal information about your spending habits, budget, and financial information (yearly income, credit, etc.)  i only wanted my stupid free prize, not a new car.  but, going along with it, i gave him my information and then he told me i won a free oil change at their dealership.  woohoo!

he had written all of my personal information on the flyer that had been mailed to me that i had brought in.  i wanted that piece of mail and all the personal information on it back.  keith jones, the salesman, took it and put it behind his back, like a child would do.  ""nah-nah, can't get it!""  i thought he was joking, but he wasn't.  i asked another employee for his name, and not only would they not tell me his name, they said ""you're not going to get that paper back.  it's ours because you gave it to us.""  

so, what do you do when someone steals something of yours?  yes, i called the police.  the dispatcher asked for his name, he said ""guess,"" he argued with me when i described his clothing to the dispatcher.  the dispatcher asked for me to talk to the manager.  salesman takes me to the ""manager"" who laughs and calls me a crazy lady.  the cops showed up, got my piece of mail, and give it back to me.

i got the police report, which had the salesman's name on it, which is the only way i know his name.  i visited their website and discovered the guy i talked to wasn't a manager, and wasn't even pictured on their website (maybe he's new?).  

anyway, lesson learned.  you get what you pay for.  i'm not going back.

don't make my mistake.   this was a 17-year old business relationship they trashed.  

if you know of an alternate chrysler dealership in nc that is more respectful, honest, and timely, please send me a message!  for now, i'm driving all the way to massachusetts for service, as when i lived there i had stellar service at sudbay chrysler in gloucester, ma."
37,negative,"do not bring your car here. i brought my car to bayview moore automotive several times over the past 4 years, because the location was very convenient for me. i have had nothing but problems with this mechanic.

i brought my car in for an oil change and brake light bulb replacement a couple years ago. bma called and told me that i really needed to have my front brake pads replaced/rear brakes serviced and that they didn't recommend leaving it too long. cost me just over $900. looking at the invoice they put a bunch of different ""packages"" together to come up with that price (they replaced and serviced the brakes, did a tire changeover, oil change, new brake light bulb). the brakes now squeak when applying them lightly, ever since they replaced them. i brought the car back twice and asked them to look at it but was told that nothing was wrong and it could just be the type of brake pads.

now in may 2016, i brought my car in for an oil change and transmission flush (based on their recommendation when they did the spring tire changeover). the work was complete at 5:00pm and i picked my car up and drove home (50km to whitby). the next day i found a large oil leak underneath my car. i drove the car back to them on monday morning and asked them to take a look at it, thinking maybe something was just loose after the oil change. they called me a about an hour later and i went over to talk to them. the car was up on the hoist and they pointed out a large crack in my oil pan that they ""noticed"" that day when i brought it in. they had already put some sort of epoxy seal on the crack and said that it should seal it up, and it would be fine. they said if the seal didn't work, i'd have to replace the oil pan, and would cost me about $500-600. i told them that i brought my car in for routine maintenance, and clearly they caused the crack in the oil pan, and they needed to fix it. the service rep talked to the owner and they replaced it for free. i can't prove it, but i have a feeling they cracked it and sealed it up on the friday and sent me home, thinking i wouldn't ever notice.

so last week i was driving on the 401 at a high speed and heard loud grinding noises coming from the engine area. this is about 10 weeks after bayview moore automotive repaired the oil pan. i thought maybe my timing belt had gone, since it was due to be replaced. i had a tow truck tow my car to a different mechanic in the neighbourhood and it wasn't the timing belt. the first thing the new mechanic said was ""have you had any work done on the car recently?"". i told them yes, and that i was recently at another mechanic. the new mechanic said that there was a bracket that attaches to the transmission and blocks out debris, and it was not reattached properly. it came loose and caught when the tires turned and broke off and got all twisted up (they gave me the twisted up part, so i still have it). anyways, the mechanic said that someone didn't put a bolt through the hole on one side of the bracket, and that's how it came loose. he said he doesn't even know why someone would have had to remove that bolt in the first place. i have to wonder if they did it intentionally.

do yourself a favour and bring your car somewhere else."
38,negative,"hey lake norman, you ever heard the phrase ""it's not you, it's me""? well based off of the comments on this page apparently the problem with your dealership is not the customers it is you! i was pleased overall with my interaction at your dealership up until recently and it has definitely gotten worse. today it came to a head. i own a 2014 grand cherokee with 34,000 miles(well under the yearly average since i purchased in july 2013) that i drive to and from the airport and around town. your 4 free oil changes is a joke given the fact i only received 3 because when i reached the point for the 4th you stated it was too late(a month over the 2yr mark). when asked to extend, you simply did not return my message/request. budget for 4 oil changes on every car sold with no time limit, simple. strike one! i went down the street for service in order to go on a trip. then i go in for two recalls and request whatever service is needed to maintain ""tires for life"" and nothing was serviced beyond the recall. strike two! then today, i go to get an overpriced service ($160 to do oil change, rotate tires and replace cabin/air filter- which were filthy but odds are they were filters kept under your counter to show customers to get them to replace) and was updated on what was needed to get my tires for life then was given a quote. i then get a call later informing me i didn't qualify because i was serviced for an oil change down the street and told i didn't service my vehicle to the program standards. changing oil every 7500 miles is the standard and was done!!! the only way you can afford to give ""tires for life"" discount is by gouging customers on your service visits hence why you disqualify a customer if they service elsewhere. your ""tires for life"" manager is a completely useless and horrible customer manager and deserves what he gets when customers choose to shop elsewhere because of him. your ""advertising"" is a shame and your business practices suck. jeep- awesome!!! will continue to be an owner on my next vehicle but will shop elsewhere. the great thing about social media lake norman jeep is that consumers can help each other avoid being manipulated by companies like yours. good day"

i am a female and made clear to paula, the receptionist and her mechanic jessie, that i do know a little about cars and that i have an idea what my issue was. 2 days later, after they said they needed the take out the engine and many expensive work hours later, i got my car back. it worked for about an hour, then the check engine light came on. that day  i received a phone call from paula saying that they forgot to install a part....the missing tube was sent to the shop late, yet they released my car. how does that happen. they really need to communicate with each other!!! no apologies or anything, instead paula told me she could ship it on my cost and charge my credit card.
since i am from out of town, i had my ""professional"" audi mechanic check out the bill and the work they performed on my a4 after my trip....and he was just shaking his head with a deep exhale. first off did they not only break part of a plastic tube, they also charged me double ($30) for coolant. when i picked up the car, i signed the 3 page bill without checking...and i do take full responsibility for that, however non of the mechanics actually came out to explain the work they did.
these guys might just be good enough for an oil change.
with that said....i recommend to everyone to rather get a tow truck than to pull into ted wiens!!!"
40,negative,"screw this place!! my boyfriend and i decided to stay here for the night, we are locals and were just looking for a little staycation.  the hotel was rundown and depressing and the room felt more like a prison cell and of course the hookers. but i kind of expected it for the price we paid. none of that even bothered me. the thing that pissed me off enough to complain on the internet about was in the morning when i got my car from the valet (or better yet didn't get my car) the attendant proceeded to throw my keys at me saying ""your car won't start it just clicks"" as he went on with helping other people who were waiting for their cars. i had to stop him from what he was doing just to find out where exactly it was parked. when i got to my car clearly the battery had died. i then called and asked to talk to the hotel manager. i've never had trouble with the battery just giving out for no reason. my best guess is that when they took the key out try clicked it too far back and the inside lights were left on. when i talked to the manager i might as well have been talking to a computer. he took my info while i was sitting stranded in the valet parking lot. i asked what he could do to help me and he simply said ""i'll have to make some call and do some research"". luckily i had a friend come to my rescue and give me a jump. 5 hours later the manager calls and says sorry i couldn't see your lights on in the camera, nothing we can do for you. not only was i late for work because of this whole debockel my battery died again because it was so drained from whatever they did. the costumer service of this place is appalling. downtown is trying to do a revamp, they should just give up on the old cortez. save yourself a bunch of annoyingness and don't even go in here"
41,negative,"the worst auto repair service i have ever recieved. i took my truck in at the open of business on a saturday morning. needed a heater core, 6 hour job. they did not start it that day, or sunday, or monday. nor did anyone from firestone ever call me, in 4 days. i had to constantly call to check on progress. i was given excuses that it was a big job and they were short handed. monday they began and finished the job, 6 hours later. i picked up my truck, paid $900 and left. 10 miles down the road, my check engine light came on. i took it back the next day and they tried to charge me $99 for the diagnosis!! the problem was, they had forgotten to bleed some line.....etc. be advised before taking your vehicle here. this occured in april, 2018"
42,negative,"quick service replacing the recalled airbag in my cr-v, but when i tried to pick up the car, it had a check engine light and stalled repeatedly in the parking lot. neither had ever been issues prior to dropping it off, but the service department refused to look into it without paying $110 for diagnostics. i spoke to management and they reluctantly agreed to read the check engine light. the results eventually showed the issue to be unrelated to the airbag replacement, but it also revealed their lack of commitment to customer service and their only goal to be taking your money."
43,negative,"2013 brand new sonata - new problem of the month! now the car won't start. the message is ""key not detected"". the key fob is in the freaking car!! wtf is wrong now??? checked the internet - this is a common problem that hyundai is aware of since 2011!!! could be the key fob, could be the brake pad sensor, could be this, could be that...could be hyundai sucks!! do not buy a hyundai, you will be hugely disappointed....maybe this is why the salesman switched out cars at the last minute after my being there over 6 hours!! be sure to read the 38 ""not recommended"" reviews to read the other half of the reviews on yelp!!!"
44,negative,"my husband brought our car into c&r about three weeks ago. we asked for an oil change and mentioned our check engine light had been coming on and also asked for a full inspection. when they called us to tell us what was needed my husband walked over to talk in person since we live super close. we needed a premium oil change because there was oil gunk that needed to be removed, timing belt was going bad, our spark plugs needed changed, new back tires, and we had a cracked radiator. we were told see you monday and our bill would be (gulp) $2000. thankfully i just got a new job that gave me more than 12 hours a week and we just got our taxes too.
anyways monday comes and thankfully i had the day off. i had to call them around 430 because i hadn't heard anything yet. i was told that they received a damaged radiator and had to order a new one, but still hoping they could finish the car by end of business. at 545 i get a call that the courier was stuck in traffic and they wouldn't be able to finish our car until tuesday morning. i was assured this time that part was in good condition and correct....
tuesday: the part isn't in!!? where is this courier coming from? is he still stuck in traffic? or is this actually just a line i was fed? my husband has to go to work and we need our car for him to go! when they finally call they tell him that the part that came in is wrong and the hoses do not match up, but don't worry it's only going to cost you another $200.
so now my husband has to call in since we have no one to take him to work, c&r doesn't offer rentals or to take him to get one, and a bus is out of the question.
wednesday: finally our car is ready! yay! everything looks great, sorry we took so long, and this car will give you at least another 100,000 miles.....
since that day our check engine light has come on again! we called c&r and are told that they have another idea of what the actual issue might ""really be"" and to go ahead and bring it in, not to worry this should only cost $100, or so....
our power steering belt came loose...they did fix that for free (that's the 1 star)
oh and our car died last weekend!
thanks c&r!"
45,negative,"as far as body work goes they did a nice job. however, when a car goes into a repair shop with a check engine light on (which came on as soon as the accident happened) one would think that this same car would leave the shop with the check engine light off. however, this wasn't the case. after expressing my concern about this not being fixed, i was told ""we cleared the code. if it comes back on, we will take it to dealership for testing"". 
i was apprehensive about driving my car after this knowing that something is still wrong from the accident.  i use my car to drive my children around so it's imperative that it was returned to me to be just as safe as it was prior to bringing it in to the shop. 
a day and a half later, the light came back. after giving it some time to see if it would go away on it's own, i returned to tallmadge collision to reiterate that i do not feel safe in the car they returned to me. 
their advice ""you'll have to call your insurance about it."" 

if the car would've been repaired correctly, i would not have to ""call my insurance"" about it. 
 
my family and i have had body work done on numerous vehicles here over the years. i can say with 110% confidence that i will not be using tallmadge collision for any future repairs."
46,negative,"this business employs subpar specialists and runs a neglectful auto repair shop rooted in deceit. unfortunately, busy buggy or busy boots has yet to learn the art of creating loyal customers through integrity and loyalty. this is a hard blow for me since i frequent small mom & pop businesses as a way of giving back to my community instead of the huge conglomerates. 

i am the owner of the toyota brought into b.buggy on 6/22 with gregg (the review below mine). i personally didn't originally leave a review because my best friend gregg did. additionally, i was trying not to ding this business with another 1-star review for the same service experience. unfortunately, the store manager hamid has been instigating another review - specifically from me - by manipulating the validity of gregg's review by calling in to question his identity even though hamid has already been provided sufficient proof to support our claim and idenities.

background: i brought my vehicle in for service the day after replacing my car battery when it died during a short stop at a convenience store. my car insurance paid for roadside service to get my car back on the road when it wouldn't start. i assumed the root case was the battery, so i went to reilly's and had my battery tested. they determined that my battery needed to be replaced. i bought a new battery and went about the rest of my day (see exhibit 1). only i was now hearing some strange noises coming from under my hood. i had an intuition that the battery may not have been the root cause but the end result of a bigger problem with my car.  the next day, and two days before we would embark on a 2800 miles cross country move, we visited b.buggy's for a pre-trip inspection. i was super clear with them about the details of what recently happened with my car, the recent noises, and the fact that my car would be making a long trip during record heat (see exhibit 2).

during the service, b.buggy was also extremely clear about what they checked and what they recommended for service/repair. this included everything from an upper engine torque mount, license plate light bulb, wiper blames, air filter, and engine air filter to simply letting me know in what they called a ""vehicle memo"" that my transmission fluid was over filled. had they merely checked the voltage of my alternator as hamid claimed met ""specs,"" (see exhibit 4) i guarantee you that notation would have been included among the many other notes and suggestions on my estimate (see exhibit 2 & 3). the truth is, they didn't really check my alternator, but hamid is now posing as a post-diagnostician as he now attempts to sway the public into believing that it ""appears"" that my situation was the alternator brushes which he claims is too costly to fix and not practical to even mention before a 2800 mile trip (exhibit 5)  however, he claims my alternator was tested and yet his shop omitted this one important ""vehicle memo"" that could validate his statement.

when my car wouldn't start the morning of our road trip while at a gas station 20-minutes out of las vegas, i immediately got my car to the nearest toyota dealership. service confirmed my alternator was faulty and not charging (exhibit 6). i am truly thankful that this situation happened within the city limits because the alternatives could have been scary, e.g., stuck in the texas panhandle during record-breaking heat waves and intermittent cell service. yicks! 

hamid's manner of handling this complaint was troubling - although not initially. he sent a private yelp message to gregg (exhibit 4). after a couple email exchanges, he asked for invoice proof (sent to busyboots@outlook.com) in exchange for a fair reimbursement to offset ""the cost associated with the repair not being caught while in our shop"" (exhibit 7). at first, hamid seemed genuinely concerned about his business and making things right to earn our business and respect in spite of various excuses and an obvious lie in his exchange. however, once we furnished the proof, hamid posted a superficial yelp comment questioning who gregg was, his name not matching the vehicle description, and of course stating that ""quite a bit of my earnings taking care of unhappy motorists... to avoid ill feelings towards me and my business"" (see exhibit 5). hmm. why does he spend a lot of money on ill feelings toward him and his business? do his customers value his service? hamid then posted an update on 8/25 (exhibit 8), which ultimately prompted this reply. 

although hamid was never asked to make restitution, he did volunteer to do so. however, hamid actions when confronted with the truth were less than honorable and down right deceitful."
47,negative,"i've been bringing my truck here for more than a year for my oil changes. i've always paid for the full service oil change just to make sure all my fluids are topped up.
well i took my truck here for its latest oil change and left it to run accross to the shipping center accross thomas.
i guess i should have stayed.. like i usually do..
here it is not quite two weeks later and my truck started making unusual noises..
come to find out my oil filter has not been changed, i'm down more than 2 quarts of oil, my radiator is empty and my transmission fluid is gunky.

suffice it to say i will not be coming back and i will be looking into filing a complaint with the bbb.

so my advice is that if you want to bring your vehicle here, make sure you stay and watch what they do to your automobile.

as for me, i'm looking at having to have my engine completely cleaned of burnt oil and transmission fluid and hope i won't have to get a new transmission or engine."
48,negative,"worst worst experience!!

i came in to change my oil, then they told me i need to change all of my brakes ($300). 

after i changed my breaks, the back of my vehicle starts to make noises (i.e. flapping noise and squeaking noise).  i came in a few days later to ask the reason, they told me that it was something wrong with the new brake pads alignment.  so they fixed it. but no, the noise is still there. i went back again, the next day. they told me it was not about the brake alignment,  it is about the transmission, and engine mounts (another $700)!  

if it is not anything about my brake pads alignment and it is about my mounts, why don't they tell me at the first time went back?  how does mounts issue cause noises from the back of my vehicle?  no one explained the reason detailed for me."
49,negative,"car wash cleveland left my car inoperable due to the water damage they caused to the hybrid computer system that controls my car. after i got home, i was unable to drive my car anywhere, let alone back to car wash cleveland the next day. i had to get my car towed to the dealership to be fixed that night because i needed to have a functioning car. i was in the middle of a move and needed to be out of my apartment on dec. 1st and was unable to do this without a car. diego suggesting that i should have waited until the next day to have a functioning car is absurd. getting a car detail does not mean receiving a car back that is inoperable. the toyota certified technicians also confirmed that the check engine light being on after a detail is not normal, it is dangerous because water is inside the electrical computer system of the car. if turning on the heat would have ""dried out"" my car as diego suggested, my car would not have quit functioning. the issue was not only that my check engine light was on and my car was sluggish after i left the detail shop, it was that my car would not drive after i got home. the dealership did not ""blow out"" my car as diego suggested. expert technicians ran diagnostic tests on the hybrid computer system, then took it apart, dried it out, put the computer system back together and ran diagnostic tests again to make sure it was functioning properly. only technicians that are certified in this computer system are able to properly fix the problem. a car detail shop, that was not even aware of my car having a computer system, is not the appropriate party to intrust with fixing it. 
when i picked up my car at 5:10pm on 11/30/16 from car wash cleveland, i tipped diego before driving my car and realizing that is was damaged. as soon as i drove out of the parking lot and became aware of the problem i informed diego of the issue. this was about 5:15pm, not 7pm as diego states, and i have copies of the phone logs documenting when this conversation occurred. when he informed me that the issue was ""normal"" and to dry out my car, i agreed because i had not yet spoken to the toyota dealership to find out that it is not normal and good be dangerous. it was also before my car would not shift into drive. as soon as my car became inoperable, i called car wash cleveland multiple times but it was after their business hours. getting my car functioning asap was a priority for me since i needed it to move. i did not have the luxury of waiting to see if car wash cleveland could fix it themselves. bottom line is, if you are a professional company and you damage someones property during a service, you must take responsibility for it instead of trying to blame the client for how they handled the situation after you damaged their car. it is also very unprofessional to promise that you will file an insurance claim and then fail to do so. there is a good likelihood that car wash cleveland is not insured since they will not provide me with their insurance information. i have reported them to the bbb and asked them to please investigate this business for proper licensing and insurance."
50,negative,"i will never take my vehicle there again for service and i would highly recommend you go elsewhere. i took my car to them to address a check engine light that had come on indicating an issue with my evap system. every single time i got the car back (i visited about 6 times, so many times i lost count) the light would come back on with the same code. i would then try to schedule another appointment to address and fix it properly and either not hear back about trying to schedule the appointment or what was going on. they should have prioritized my service experience given their failure to address and fix the problem the first, second, third, forth etc. time but i was consistently treated poorly. they comped the work done (due to their failure in fixing the issue) then called me the night before my next appointment (again, for the same issue) to accuse me of not paying for all the ""work"" they've done on my car when it was their inability to properly service the vehicle all along making them lose money on the repair. i took the car in to pay to fix the problem, not to waste my time, theirs, and get free shit. do not take your vehicle there."
51,negative,"took my 2013 st in for a new battery got a call couple hours later they suggested to replace my negative battery cable with sensor. ok i didn't plan on walking out spending $300 to replace a battery and cable but it is what it is. driving my car home getting off freeway and my car will not shift out of second i limp home call berge ford tell them the issue and asked if it had anything to do with the battery replacement nope shouldn't have anything to do with it they said. ok now i call my extended warranty people who can't pick the car up until the next day, they tow it to their shop and trouble shoot the issue. seem as though when they changed the battery out they broke a tab on the lower air box and then instead of replacing the damage they did they decided to glue the tab on.. guess what the tab blew off on the way home and got stuck in the transmission linkage. so berge now sends a tow truck to the warranty company to pick it up and repair it. they did replace the lower air box at no charge and got the tab out of the linkage. i was offered an apology and that was it. i'm in the service industry you did the bare minimum to cover your mistake. what about my time and being without my vehicle for two days? just because you can repair it in one day does not mean i can drop what i'm doing in my life to come and pick my car up on your schedule. it was extremely inconvenient to me and something that i felt was not taken into consideration when i came to pick it up the second time."
52,negative,"last month my wife took in her car because of an oil leak. they did some engine modification and up-sold us on some ac line replacements. when she got her car back it still had an oil leak and her ac would only blow hot air. the mechanic stripped her oil drain plug and there was still problems with the ac lines.

last week i took my car in for a check engine light. they tried to up-sell $400 for an oil pressure switch, belt and air filter housing. the belt is in good shape and the air filter housing is a missing a screw. spoke to another fletchers, midas and gm dealership about air filter housing replacement. all of them agree that there is no reason to replace the housing. 

this location is horrible, go to the 35th ave and union hills location or find another repair shop."
53,negative,"i wish you could give this place no stars.  do yourself a favor and don't buy a car from here.  i hate typing and never leave reviews, but this place is ridiculous.  i have boughten two yukon denali's from here.  one was 2yrs old $33k and one brand new $60k and i will never buy from here again in my life.  i have had to use the service department on seven different occasions and almost none of my experiences went well.  you pull in with an appointment and half the time it takes 5 min to get greeted even though they are all just sitting there pretending to work on their computers.  it takes a minimum all day to get your truck back half of the time they don't even diagnose the problem for 6 or 7 hrs.  i had horrible experiences the 2nd and 3rd time that  i can't even remember most recently they failed to call the car rental company and get that reimbursed for us they forget about you and i have had to call in several times a day each time to stay on them to get things done.  i tried to take it to firestone in anthem which has great customer service and gets things done quickly, but i found out gm is making it almost impossible for any other place but the dealership to work on it and it won't let their computers diagnose the problems for transmissions and they are working on making that for everything.  so if you buy from there you are going to be stuck getting it serviced there.  they have a shuttle that is nice they will take you wherever you want to go and come back and pick you up so that is nice because you need it for the all day ordeals and seven hour oil changes.  the one service guy rannell somewhat at least try's to make up for his mistakes i will give him credit for that.  the service was so bad my wife called gmc corporate to complain and then he got things taken care of.  we asked to speak with the manager on 3 separate occasions and he isn't working half of the time and has never returned a call to date.  of course since they are basically a government agency the service is horrible it is probably impossible to get fired there from what i have seen.  the difference between going to firestone in henderson and this place is remarkable.  firestone has super friendly professional people they handle things quickly and get them done while gm just seems like they don't care and they have you by the balls because you can't take it anywhere else.  i am selling my denali as quickly as possible to get an escalade which pisses me off gm still gets my money but i will be cadillacs service is much better.  i am only sticking with gm simply for the fact that rannell guy owns up to his mistakes and fixes them.  i can't get to mad if someone admits they screwed up and fixes it, but overall that place is ridiculous especially to have a manager not call back or to be present from a customer that buys brand new the most expensive cars they have that costs more than some houses you would expect a little better service.  i think this is the first review i have ever done thats how much i dislike this place and not just on one experience, but 7 and what the hell kind of brand new car breaks down 5 times.  the warranty is great though and pays for everything so if you do buy make sure and buy the warranty."
54,negative,"we took my vw bug here to get fixed, and i was told i needed a new mass air flow sensor. we took the car here 3 times, and each time they claimed it was fixed, but the check engine light kept coming on. we took the car somewhere else, and they told us we needed a mass air flow sensor made specifically for a vw. meineke completely disagreed with that, and continued to put in random mass air flow sensors not for a vw. when i demanded they put a vw part in, they specifically told me ""fine, if you want us to put a part in with the words volkswagon on it, we can but it won't help."" i then demanded a refund. i was told my car was word for word ""a pain in the butt"" to work on. everyone i ever spoke to was extremely rude to me. working on my car was obviously a hassle for someone who's job is to work on cars. even after i asked for a refund, my dad had to call and then walk in in order to get the refund. i eventually got the refund and took my car elsewhere. as soon as i got a vw mass air flow sensor put in, my car was fixed. never go to meineke unless you want to have someone roll their eyes at you."
55,negative,"i had a 2014 fiat 500l that i purchased from findlay brand new.  unfortunately, at 11,000 miles the transmission went out.  i took it to towbin for service since they are closer to me.  24 days in service and a new transmission.  i had the thought of trading it in on a new 500l with the different transmission.  i owned 3 fiats at the time, 2 500s and the 500l.  
after looking at the 500l vs the 500x, i decided on the l since it is definitely more bang for the buck.  i admit that i got a very good trade in value on my 2014 500l considering noone wants these vehicles.  alonzo was very good and seemed straight forward which i appreciated.  chris was actually my sales person and a huge disappointment.  my 2014 500l had the navagation system, backup cameras, fully loaded.  you could talk to the system.  the 2015 did not have the nav or backup camera, which i could live without.  however it was vital to have all the other features to me.. text messaging, streaming, song identification, etc which this vehicle does not have.  chris informed me that i must have the wrong type of phone.  i did not change anything.  
after a call to fiat i learned the truth.  chris' response was ""my 500x has all those features...""..  incidentally chris does not return calls or texts.  i even texted him the screen to show that there is no identification of music.. very disappointed...
at the same time, on the same day i bought the 500l, i also traded in my 500 on a 2014 kia soul from the vw dealership.  they brought it over and fiat sold it to me.. that vehicle is phenomenal.  it is 100x better than the 500l.
so today, i texted alonso to tell him that i was not exactly happy and i was going to do some reviews.  he sounded like he was going to help.  he said that he would talk to chris.  i told him my story on how i love the soul and i am going to get rid of the 500l.  he texted me back saying ""let me know if i can help""..... crickets... crickets...   they have 2 kia souls on their lot.  i've had the 2015 500l and the soul for about 2 months... i've put 3500 miles on the soul and 250 on the 500l   tell me which one i like better now...."
56,negative,"this review is speaking to the service department.  

the service was horrible.  i was given don as a service representative.  don acted like he was interested in my vehicle but i found out he was simply trying to swindle me into more service.  i took my trailblazer in for an oil change when i first moved to vegas because i did not know what auto shops to trust.  don recommend i flush all my fluids as my vehicle had 70k miles on it.  so had the money so i paid to flush my transmission, brake, drive train, etc etc fluids.  a year later my check engine light was on so i took it back to findlay to fix the issue so i could pass the smog check to register my car.  good ol don tells me that my transmission and brake fluids looked dirty and needed a flush.  i had just flushed them a year before!! recently i needed a new battery, and instead of spending a half day figuring it out myself, i decided to take it to findlay.  the service operator quoted me $50 labor to replace the battery.  good ol don again charged me $80/hr aaand told me my fluids looked dirty and needed flushing again!!! this guy paid no attention to my vehicle files, tried to swindle me into flushing my fluids multiple times, charged me more labor than i was quoted, and to top it all off while i was waiting he dumped me off with a sales rep, so i had to hear a whole sales pitch.  i am currently a student with debt and no income and a paid off vehicle, so i why would i want to buy a car? i wouldn't. again don did not listen to a word i said."
57,negative,"terrible place! run by crooks! stay away!

this is essentially an epic fail blog, so the key points first:
- bait-and-switch pricing
- reserved car not available - downgraded
- cars in non-road-worthy condition
- cleaning fee extortion only circumvented by bribing mechanic/cleaner

we came into vegas with a plan to do two days of off-roading in the death valley area, four jeeps in total. we reserved the jeeps, got a price quote (over the phone mind you, not written) for the rental of four off-road ready jeeps. we mention multiple times that we would be taking these jeeps off-road, checking to make sure that we can buy sufficient insurance coverage for the drivers who do not have it through their auto insurance. we show up, and low-and-behold, they only have two off-road ready jeeps, another being a stock vehicle with no lift and rock-crawling tires. a long wait ensues until that third jeep is made ready. yay. the fourth one is sourced from death valley.

then comes the bait-and-switch; the clerk behind the counter tells us that ""oh, since you'll be taking these jeeps off-road, there is an $80 surcharge per day to the price that we quoted you."" completely ridiculous, classic bait-and-switch! we told them from the beginning that we were going off road. after arguing for an extended period of time, and letting them know that what they're doing is really not cool (and illegal, for that matter), they reduce their surcharge, but do not void it altogether. well, we were in a holdup position and had to get out of there if we were to make our planned arrival in death valley.

once we were on the road, the check engine light comes on in two jeeps. mine also shows ""change oil"" every time i start it. great. just what you want to drive into the desert. once on the highway, we find that all of the soft tops have essentially disintegrated. they no longer clip into the body properly, and half of the zippers break once they're hit by the road wind. we have to repack the cars to make sure that we don't shed any equipment onto the highway or possibly strike a motorist or biker. in the end, we have to pull all of the soft windows out so that they don't flap violently and hit the backseat passengers in the face.

we go into death valley, run about 60 miles off-road, have fun anyway, and bring the jeeps back on time on sunday. we drive into the lot, and the clerk (a different guy) tells us ""the way those jeeps look, we will have to detail them and charge you for the cost of cleaning. they are disproportionately dirty. "" i ask how much it will cost, and he tells me ""up to $350, but i won't know until we're done."" we paid a dubious off-road surcharge, and now they want to ding us again! are the jeeps dusty? of course they are! they were in the desert...off road. could we do anything about it? no! we couldn't even put in the windows of the soft top since they were broken.

in the end, we just pay off the lot tech with $20 each so that he gives the office his ""seal of approval"". at that point, we just wanted to get out of there with as little further financial damage as possible. what a miserable place. on the way to our hotel, we at least heard that the owner of the company likes to take his cars out into the desert, get drunk, and then drive around in donuts. quality bunch.

my advice: never do business with these people!

note: u save car rentals and dream car rentals are the same business."
58,negative,service department is as much of a scam as anywhere else. brought my truck in for a check engine light and they tried roping me into over 10k in repairs. f that! i'll drive the 4 days back to my home and get the repairs done.
59,negative,"took my car here when my automatic transmission was having trouble getting into gear. they told me that the radiator had broken and had leaked fluid into the transmission, which meant i needed a complete overhaul of the transmission. they estimated the cost to be around $3500! i'll admit, i don't know cars as well as i would like to, but this diagnosis just didn't make sense to me. i took it to a private repair shop for a second opinion. not only was his opinion different, he told me that cottman's had fabricated the entire story. the radiator was fine, it wasn't leaking at all. there was no coolant or any other damage to the transmission. the transmission fluid was dirty, but a simple flush at the second repair shop took care of that. my car is running great now, and it cost me $160 not $3500. save yourself the hassle and stress and don't go to cottman's in the first place."
