charged me too much money for nothing". i ended up trading in my car for a better made car with a warranty. there was a warning light on indicating a recall should have been performed. while checking the car we discovered there was a recall on the door panel. the fact that this was discovered while we were driving demonstrated the quality of work being done at vette culture in general. during our research and while in the car, i discovered other warranty issues, some of which were very minor. 

once you get past the initial rude phone call and you get into the culture, you'll find this to be a very friendly place.

the good thing about this location is that they're very helpful. they'll explain the basic steps in finding the problem and at the end of the day they'll just say that you may still have the problem and that they'll just run tests to see how it's running and that they can give you a diagnostic price.

not happy with this, but there are also a few things that i need to get out of the way so first things first.
my car would not accelerate past 20mph even with full throttle (the setting) and even when it did, its not like it was at 50mph or anything, just sped up or slowed down. i asked for an adjustment and when i got it, the dealer told me it was all set. 
then half way through the service section i decide to just post an update on my experience and see how things go, my car would not even brake at the end of the service section. i had called the service manager in advance and they made me wait while they got to the repairs so i could get out the car

not happy about that.  i've worked hard for my money to get where i am today… and worst case scenario, i could get whacked with a bootleg battery for my troubles.  pit stop!  i've worked my ass off to get where i am and damn near broke my car.  i'll get a second opinion before i hit the pump and change the oil.  i'm pretty sure the transmission is so messed up that it was put there intentionally to cause as much destruction in the future."

not happy with the service however, since we had a previous experience with them which was fine.  we went back to them with a problem that was worse that the first time, and the service manager was rude and insulted my parent when he took our car for an oil change which my parent was too lazy to do herself.  the service manager said that she just wanted to make sure the car was good so she wouldn't be replacing parts that would become worn down after a couple of days.  she was absolutely terrible!  i will never use this dealership again and will always tell family and friends how awful they are!"

engine service department. to develop and test-drive a vehicle is a skill that requires a certain amount of knowledge and experience. each car is different and has a price. understanding your vehicle and learning as much as you can about it is a skill that will prepare you for service. 
 

i ultimately decided to forgo the extended warranty due to poor experience, mainly because the service department has been unprofessional throughout the process.  i feel as though they have no interest in improving my vehicle beyond replacing the coil springs and mapping the electrical system. apart from that, the only reason i'm giving a 2 star review is because the clinic was able to fix a small leak in my glove box and get home without performing another service-related fix.

engine service department has had several issues with the vehicle and the issues have been getting worse daily.

on my last visit to the shop i told them that the transmission was showing signs of failure and they should fix it but it was not going to be cheap to fix. maureen told me that the price would be more than the car was expected to do to repair the transmission. i have to disagree, the car did come with a warranty and repair the transmission rather than fix the problems with the transmission. this is probably the cheapest and most effective repair that you can do with the car. i also think that the mechanic was a little rough with me, he put too much pressure on the car and made me feel that way.

I took my transmission out after having it a month and a half to have it inspected. a few hours later they called and said that after they removed the check engine light, which was the quickest and cheapest way to do it, they ran the vehicle into the firestone parking lot to see if it would burn in. when they got back to us they said that there was only 0.03 quarts of alcohol in the transmission fluid which is what we ordered. so basically they charged us for two quarts of alcohol and told us to just wash our hands of it and go on our way. almost a month later, almost a thousand dollars spent on this car a car that was running extremely rough when we brought it in. could not even get firestone to continue

I took my transmission out to get it checked out and the second day I had it they told me that the check engine light was on because the battery was bad. the repair cost for a battery such as this is approximately $150 and the labor is usually only 20-25 hours long. i decided to take my truck back to smog instead of going to the dealership as i had originally planned. i was told that fixing the battery was the only thing that could be done 'without breaking another part'. after calling other mechanics about this they all agreed that it was most likely a bad battery. so after paying for the diagnostic, i went to pay the bill to inspect the vehicle. i had previously asked for an oil change and some other repairs, the check engine light

I took my transmission out into the street in the middle of the afternoon and drove it at night for the remainder of the day and night. i took it back into the shop at nightfall and they told me that the tensioner was broken. they didn't know what else to charge me for. i told them that i didn't take the transmission out into the street and i brought it back in by the truck on the following morning. i was late for work and couldn't get my car back in time to get work done. i had to wait another day and night before they could cast the transmission. then i took my car in on the morning of the 12th and work started that that very same day. so, my car started to run and i took

I took my transmission in it was fixed......so why was i told originally that it was leaking tpms and smog records???

then one day i came to get diagnosed and i was told that there were scratches on my car that had not been there before. the technician that i spoke to later told me that both the scratches on my car had come from the removal of the mats that the transmission was manufactured with. i asked how much they had changed the fluid? he told me it was $79.99. i asked how much the records would cost and he told me $459.06. i decided to call back and speak with him to see what the status was. 

i ended up speaking with the service manager and he was very

I took my transmission home to check out some rust damage that had recently appeared on my transmission. now, this is where it gets interesting. i took my car to a reputable repair shop who had been recommended to me by a friend. christopher was my new mechanic. he ran all diagnostic tests and looked at my car after receiving the code. christopher gave me a quote which was twice the cost of the diagnostic, and was unable to determine what the problem was. he also did not perform the repairs, even though he claimed he had. i asked him what was wrong with my car, and the mechanic told me that there was a leak in a few small parts of my transmission. these leaks were inconspicuous to me at the time, and the mechanic felt

I took my transmission in to have it inspected. for a cost of $550, they determined that the transmission seal was still loose despite having just rebuilt the transmission and a full engine wash.
the mechanic who i have been speaking to on this issue, and the one who actually replaced my transmission, had no idea how loose the transmission seal was. they told me they checked the seals and the new transmission was in much better condition than i remembered. 
i went back to inspect my other transmission items that were in better condition. i had them all to him who assured me they just replaced the seal and didn't do anything to it. 
the other wastebasket that i had to replace contained a tube that i had been talking about trying to get repaired

I took my transmission out and i see the check engine light…and then the check engine light is on again. great…and now i have emissions to do! greg basically told me that i did not pay for any of this and that he would not defend the cause. i had to take my truck to another dealership and pay them to not renew the emissions on my 2025. this is what happened…

 either the check engine light is on because of old emissions that are no longer valid or it is on to renew the emissions on my 2025. tedious, but necessary. i will not go back to this dealer for any reason in the future. if something like this happens to you, please report them to the better business bureau."

I took my transmission out to the shop and explained the situation. the technician looked at it and said that he thinks my transmission needed to be flushed. so obviously, that caused a huge amount of stress in my motor and rectus muscle. needless to say, my transmission leaked fluid. i had to pay for that at the dealership 99 cents per gallon. (the actuality is that my fluids are low, but i have a motor that spews oil with no problem. so my concern was that my motor was not working properly and i needed to flush it.) i took my truck back to jeep and they said that they had flushed it and that nissan is not beserk enough. needless to say, my truck overheated very quickly. i checked the fluid

I took my transmission to their mechanic and got all new rotors and a fuel injection system fix.

i came back and they called me and said that they had fixed the transmission and that i could drive it to the dealership. i took it back and said ok lets see how the tech and the fill his lungs in a little bit ok some misfires but otherwise great stuff.

I took my transmission to be rebuilt up front and it took a couple of days to get around to installing the new booster in the transmission (just before it was due for delivery).

on the afternoon of 6/16/2016 i went to autozone to get a new booster and had it installed and ready to go. i asked them to drive the car to make sure it was good to go and they did, after which the car failed to advance. i had no choice, for the job at hand was too damn hot. 

i called sales and i was told that the car was too damn hot to proceed with the rebuild and i needed the booster replaced. of course i was then told that all i needed was the battery and timed belt replaced

I took my transmission in to see how things were going, and to their credit they took good care of me. 

my issue is, our mechanic deliberately set the displacement apart (not sure why or how they did it) so it would look worse when i drove it towing it home. — not sure i want that car anymore. had they not done that little thing right, i would have been out another $1000+ bucks. now i have to go to automatic for my oil change and pay over the phone for the smog check.

I took my transmission out to get diagnosed, and came back and told them i did not need it. they said that they found the problem and i cleaned and oiled the transmission and it was good. 
my problem with this place is that they charge you to diagnose problems, but when your checking engine light comes on, they will not take the trouble to look under the hood of the car so you are left with a mangled mess and no repair information to go on. i have tried repeatedly to talk to the manager to resolve this issue, and every conversation he has had me leave with empty hands and feet.

I took my transmission to my local transmission place. they looked at the truck and it was zip coded. they determined my transmission was likely old and was prone to overheating when driving, which increased the chances of a breakdown. the cost to fix this transmission was around $900. they used code reader to determine cause.
the second purchased item was a newer camshaft sensor. the timing belt was about to snap... I had my eye on the timing belt because i was on vacation and had taken the car back before taking it to another shop. camshaft sensor is an electrical sensor that measures the square of the vehicle's center console's opening. if this sensor is defective, an uncontrolled slide of the timing belt could result in a dangerous slide of the vehicle

the temp regulator is a simple plastic housing with a digital readout that shows the ambient temperature of the engine. the temp regulator is supposed to work in conjunction with the engine temp sensor to regulate the temp. allegedly changing the temp sensor requires changing the balancer. i don't see how that is possible, and if the temp sensor is working correctly and the counterbalance are not being used then what else is wrong?

I took my transmission to aamco to have them look at it and they called me to tell me that the torque converter and transmission assembly were where it was going, it is rated for 40k miles and will only cost around $300 to replace. so i figured i will trade it in and buy the part that will cost less and do the tranny that they sell that is supposed to be new and upgrade it a bit and i can really tell a difference in performance, the good thing was that poor hanny was no longer working so i just had to drive around and look for an experienced mechanic that could actually tell me what was wrong and fix it.

the concern for me was that they were not going to replace the transmission even though i had the

I took my transmission in for a diagnosis. a simple gyroscope would need to be replaced.  when they looked at my car, they couldn't find the issue and wouldn't look at my transmission (which was fine).  they had my car for 4 days and hadn't even looked at my car!  at this point, i was pissed.  i had been coming to this place for 2 years, been coming for transmissions and related repairs and now i was being ripped off -- basically, i was robbed of my $300 and the only thing i could do was complain and find some way to sabotage their ability to fix my car.  i hate that i had to come to that juncture only to find out that they couldn't even find the issue

I took my transmission back to randy and he told me it was corrupt and needed to be replaced.  i had a quote set and was charged $885.59 without a car, but only $160 of the $900 i set aside for the transmission itself.  how low can you go!  i asked how much the parts cost and when i finished reading the bill, i was still asking how much the transmission itself cost and i was told $100 without even looking at the parts.  this place is a complete rip off and i am glad i found a different place to get my car.  what is most annoying is the auto mechanic said that he takes pride in his work and doesn't take pranks seriously.  i think all mechanics should be

i called oem transmission and asked what they would say if i asked them to replace all of my metal parts and rebuild my transmission.  they said that they have a no recommend policy when it comes to parts and services.  i guess because i am a woman they think it is only acceptable to replace metal parts and not to offer other services.

i noticed with the pictures that the tech didn't take notes as we had already broken down the transmission.  unfortunately, this is a safety thing for them to record and not show the breakdown.  if someone told me that there would be a tech logged on here just to take a picture, i would want that to happen.  um, thanks but i don't have a response."

I took my transmission to desura in verdandi to have it looked at. the doctor told me that increases in the transmission fluids should not be a concern since the fluids are generally low anyway (due to temperature etc.). in any case, it was decided that i needed to replace my transmission (original purchase price)... so i decided to finance this repair myself.  more bad practice #1: don't bring your car to a shop if you work in the automotive field. i chose not to bring my car to a shop any more due to poor communication with them and my lack of trust in them.

overall, it's an experience that i will never repeat... i would strongly advise going to alternative repair shops if you need your car fixed."

I took my transmission and radiator indoors to check the temperature and found it to be creeping upwards towards the 90's.  only thing was overheating was the radiator and it was leaking coolant.  now my family will never be able to put duct tape over a radiator.   as a company you should be folding like a cheap imitation of a genuine Lamborghini dealer.  i am so disappointed and frankly i am surprised this dealer even exists."

I took my transmission to them after all this and the check engine light came on. they charged me $2800 to pull an airbag part that they never ordered and no one checked the code.....so they charged me $3000 just to see what would happen.  

i don't see the value in someone else's warranty.  i don't trust them enough to repair my cars for a while. and now they can't fix what they broke twice.  i don't think this is a reflection of their customer service, but of their employees. terrible experience.  

i won't be returning to honda west based on the way i was treated i am currently trying to get my car fixed."

I took my transmission to find out that mine was not going to brake properly and the body work was made mostly of junk. they did a full diagnostics test and found that my synchronous (the belt) is broken. when it is belt is not being pulled as planned and the car will not shift. other minor issues that were found were missing seals in the synchronous (seals in the front and transmission inside the engine), missing gaskets, missing bolts and nuts in the transmission, missing parts in the engine, missing seals in the transmission, missing gasket and missing nut on the exhaust pipe, missing seal on the exhaust pipe and missing gasket on the transmission. this is a list of the major issues found during diagnostic test and the parts that were

I took my transmission in to have the acc and battery replaced.  i was told that the stress on the transmission was normal for an 8th wheel, and that replacing the transmission and possibly the engine would also be expensive.  after doing the diagnostic and costing,  i decided that it was more likely that they were just taking the transmission apart for parts that were no good for a transmission and just clearing the code so i would get a refund.

I took my transmission about 2 miles back to get fixed and the car was still not solving the problems. on the drive back the transmission was starting to have trouble and slip which is a very serious problem in my opinion. so on the drive home i looked at my logs and i noticed that my check engine light had come on sporadically. so i took my truck back to the place i was staying and they checked it out and said it was probably a leak in the hydraulic transmission or some other issue. so i was ok with the idea that the cam shaft was leaking and i would have to pay for the repair. i took my truck back to the place i was staying and they checked it out and said there is no leak and the engine is running strong.

I took my transmission to a transmission specialist to see if they could diagnose the problem.  after an hour long conversation with the transmission specialist, bobby pinscher (who presumably is the most knowledgeable person in the transmission field) he said that there are 4 basic types of problems with transmissions:

1 - burr burr - the speed at which the trans is moving is not where it was previously.

2 - climb angle - the angle at which the trans is turning left or right.

3 - horizontal oscillation - the amount of wobbling the trans body experiences when turned.

4 - bad case where it's a sensor - the trans is leaking fluid or corrosion on the trans while it's in tune up.

10 minutes after picking it up the truck they called to tell me it was done. 

30 minutes later they called to tell me it had run like that since they got it back. 

4:30 p.m.: less than 300 miles.  either they called and told me they had it to replace the electronics, or they didn't and told me to bring it back in.  

3:30 p.m.: call back and tell them it has now been fixed and they want my truck back.  don't even want to talk to them.

I took my transmission back to say that the transmission seal was broken and i would need a new transmission for about $6000. i signed the papers, paid the $600, and went to pick it up.

17 days later, i called the dealership to tell them what happened and i told them that it was my first time coming here and i wanted them to take the car back to get fixed, rather than charging me and taking me home and

I took my transmission back to get trained and they tried to figure out why it would only shift into neutral at 70mph. about 4 facts turned out to be more accurate than the movie title. 1) it shifts in to neutral at 70mph because the transmission is driving rails at 70mph. unlike 70mph where it shifts into reverse without the use of the clutch. 2) it shifts into a higher gear after shift into neutral. 3) there is no clutch after shift into neutral. 4) the car shifts well. gross. idk why. they replaced the fuel pump, however the fuel filter and it's still not perfect. the car shifts well after that. idk if it's because i'm a girl that's driving or something, but i certainly

I took my transmission with me to get it looked at. i was told that i need to replace my transmission with a bespoke one made to my specifications. i was quoted £1400 for the bespoke model which put my total bill at around £4000. i asked how much longer and they said they didn't know how long my transmission would be there. i then found this thread which shed some light on the matter.

I took my transmission from absolute junk yard and i await repair.

really, who cares what absolute junk yard does with their trucks when they're in there for a transmission and sometimes they do amazing work with their transmission and they sell it to a family that really knows what they're doing?
in any case, i'm very disappointed and disappointed that these people are actually doing repairs on my jeep. i've owned other trucks from them, and this is by far the worst service i've experienced with a vehicle i care about. i'm also filing a complaint with yelp in hopes of some type of compensation for all of this neglect and theft of my hard earned money.

I took my transmission in and of course they said the codes are in the same area so before i got in it had some time to get used to the idea of codes not being terribly obvious. long story short they had my car for forever and never fixed what was wrong with it, i would've liked them to fix things a bit sooner but for their lame excuse of needing to fix my transmission not being fixed at this point. 

in any case i paid them a pretty penny to fix what was wrong with it and to fix what i believe was the original problem with it.

I took my transmission to the dealer, who said i have a bad catalytic converter. he said it's $600 and he replaced it. now i'm upset that he didn't fix the problem right away. fixing a catalytic converter is a no brainer fix for the average mechanic, but for someone with me you'd think he would do his job properly to make sure the car is running properly. 

the next day i took my car back to the dealer. they said my shift cable was bad and that they had ordered a new one. since my car is still showing signs of being shift driven, they recommended that i do a full reliability check on my car. i did that and my car passed the check. i wasn't overcharged,

I took my transmission to a shop and was told that my transmission head gasket was leaking and that my piston engine must of exploded. a shop that specializes in transmission repairs put these two claims together and detailed this amazing story. unfortunately, the repairs cost me over $2,000 and went on to fix other problems in my car.
the second claim is that your car's belt played a key role in the chain reaction. after reading this, i am now forced to conclude that the only reason my car's transmission was in such bad condition is because mazda purposely left it in such an unsalvageable condition. msft even went as far as to reset the rotors, close the valve covers, and then reattach the transmission. there's

I took my transmission back to swing state and they said the check engine light was on or it was in the rear differential. they put in the new battery and they said it was the new clutch and it was about $700. i decided to just get my car fixed and got it in the shop. they told me the battery was bad and of no use to me. i then got a call saying that they tested the new clutch and it was good but the electrical system might need to be replaced in the future. i would not do that to a good working transmission. i took my car to another chevy dealership in order to get the owner as well as the manager as well as the plumber aswell and they all stated that the transmission needed to be replaced

I took my transmission to a local shop to have it inspected. i was told that a lot of transmissions out there just need a couple of fluid changes and they are good to go. that speed was $150 faster than honda. not sure why honda was waiting for me. i could drop my car off anywhere, they would just call me and let me know when my car was finished. that is, until they had to put my car back on the lift. o gotts! i took my car back to honda south, now they had no record of my transmission being completed. they told me there was a bar in the drive shaft that had to be replaced. hmmm wonder if they ever found and tested the drive shaft. i really hope not

I took my transmission in to have the original check engine light diagnosed, and just to see why it had gone off. i also called in to see if they could reset the code to see if it was still on, and of course they couldn't since it was off. so basically, they ran a half-assed job and didn't really do anything right. ill be back. i need this transmission. 

unfortunately, this is also the end of my working relationship with whitney's transmission in general, and the only dealer shop in mesa that i can refer to. but i will never give my business to them again. the only reason i did is because it was a convenience for me, and a way i could support myself. i won

I took my transmission in for repairs in 2012. the repair was a big mistake. now, 5 years later, i'm paying to fix a failure that was fixed nearly 5 years ago. a job that a new car should be able to handle. really, people.

when i bought the car, the ac didn't work. the ac specifically told me that it wasn't doing something, and i told them that it's probably just the twin turbochargers. but they kept telling me that it would continue to run if i didn't get the mods done, and then they would recommend i do the mods themselves. and guess what people, i didn't have to do any of that. i just told them that i was replacing the turbochargers myself

I took my transmission out to get it replaced by a different transmission shop, and lo and behold, it was run 4x without issue.  i also called the original shop to ask them if they had seen this, and they said no they do not recall any issues on our transmissions.  i have called the 2 major dealerships in metro dallas (one in north central and one in south central), and neither recalled nor checked the vehicle they quoted me $1500 for it.  i am at a loss as to why this shop refused to repair my transmission.  don't be fooled by its exterior, this is a mafia transmission shop.  i would avoid this place like the plague."

she also told me she had spoken with the service manager and that she wanted me to have a handout explaining what she had learned about the transmission at her shop. she handed me a picture of the order form and said she wanted me to sign it. so, i checked the code(for dmv) and the registration(for dmv) and discovered that my car does not have a dmv registration.

I took my transmission back only to have the performance of the engine stripped out and the transmission fail.  i contacted ben as well as they can find by going to the tech area and asking the tech if the transmission was stripped or whatever and he states ""the pulley was bent"". the pulley is bent because the pulley was not bent to the specified dimension so may have been damaged while performing the service. he tells me it would be $1500 to replace the pulley and i agree. so i agree and as well ben put in a $200 suction cup that may or may not have been needed depending on the direction i wanted to go. i never received a call back. ben did say to expect a call. i never did receive a call

Just about every thing is custom fabricated. the electrical system is a mess. when a malfunction occurs, it's not clear what caused the error, but the owner assured me if it ever happens again, it will be fixed.  i often had to come back for service, and this time i had to drive several hours to get the military vehicle fixed.  the transmission burns gas like crazy. it's a joke.  i drove the jeep some more, and its transmission is slipping so much, it almost seems like it's broken.  the tailgate seal is leaking, and the airbag is leaking, and the wipers are leaking.  it's all very disheartening.  oh, by the way, the water pump and transmission fluid

Just about every reputable automotive repair shop has a policy of ""reduced"" or ""exorbitant"" the rates charged for parts and services. i personally spent almost $2,500 on parts and $900 on repairs at sams before my transmission failed. i spent another $900 on the aftermarket part called direct injection that supposedly solved the problem.  sams is a first rate, family owned and operated business. i can't afford their excessive rates, but i didn't have any other options.  if you want to buy a car from them, buy locally, save yourself aggravation and anger, and potentially have your vehicle fixed extra cost.  if you want to educate yourself about them, read my review of the most recent sams for more

Just about every mechanic i talked to said they were too busy to look at my accident report and some said they didn't have the time, or they didn't have the equipment. the customer service didn't seem especially friendly either.

my favorite part about the service department (besides the mechanics) is the fact that they're very reasonable and reasonable about things. they'll take care of the bill and not push you into unnecessary repairs. also, the employees. the owner, michael, is very friendly and has a positive attitude. the staff is polite, the bills are paid promptly and the automobile is kept in a well-ventilated area. the only thing i can say is, don't expect that at all when buying your car from here.

Just about every reputable mechanic will tell you that the spark plugs and ignition coils are going to have to be replaced unless you have a reconditioned engine (which 99.99% of the time doesn't have the parts). the only exception is if you're in the area for more than one repair, in which case i'd go with them all being replaced.

Just about every service department in the area has a shop that specializes in transmission service.  if there's a specific problem that you're having the night before or if you're going out with someone, chances are good that the shop that would take care of you would not only know the problems but also have a good amount of experience with fixing them.  if your issue is with the transmission but not with the clutch or drive shaft, chances are pretty good that the shop would run diagnostics and fix the problem without replacing the transmission.  on the other hand, if you have an ignition coil problem and you need it fixed now then definitely go to a different shop.  if the issue is the exhaust system then probably the right shop to go would be the wrong

Just about every shop in my neighborhood has at least one mechanic that utilizes a transmission oil pan as a counterweight.

Just about every shop recommends oil change & filter twice. at the shop we visited they only did a simple oil change and a very basic oil change. our shop manual explicitly states that they do not do an oil change & do not carry an oil filter.  leaving that to a third party shop is just plain stupid.  if an oil change does occur they will put in some tamper-proof v-caps to stop oil leaking.  it is also strongly advised that you have another mechanic do the final inspection to verify that the work is complete before you drive off that car.

Just about every starter i've heard of recommends using a cam shaft sealer with some variation on the tagline ""trust my mechanic"". i trust their service department more than i do the camshaft supplier. i'm a frequent customer at rogers buscourses in and around buffalo, ticker by ticker they've cleaned out their garage to make way for the new car's engine and transmission.

about a month ago i took my car to comedy auto care in peoria for a simple water leak repair. the tech came recommended a specific type of repair due to the angle of my vehicle:


1- cam shaft sealer


2- high velocity ceramic tile (potentially hazardous to workers working on your vehicle)

Just about every opinion piece and op-ed in the local papers and magazines has sided with me, to the chagrin of the manger. i found the guy through a mutual friend and he was very helpful. here is my story... i got a flat tire while driving to work. i had him put a tire on it and then drove to work. while at work they called to ask if the tire had a top speed limit, since the tire had a speed limit of 110mph. i said sure, because that is the speed limit for 90mph at 75mph wind gust... and they said they would fine me whatever the speed limit was. i agreed, so the mechanic suggested i get a speed sensor. going into the shop i had always trusted

Just about every shop i've ever been to has been terrible.  i spent months trying to get my check engine light diagnosed and fixed, and weeks after the repair they didn't even call me to let me know the light was fixed, even though i had called them multiple times.  my car is still stuck in 15th place, and my light is never going to go off.  i will never trust this diagnostic service."

Just about every plumbing professional agrees that there should be an inspection of your vehicle before you buy. no matter what brand of car you are purchasing your inspection should focus on the following areas:

1) check engine light( check engine light usually means there is something wrong with the engine )
2) leaks and potential damage to raw metal ( possibly leaks in the exhaust pipe or transmission at this point )
3) check engine light( check engine light usually means there is something wrong with the check engine light )

i reached out to the other shop because i know they can do the work (assuming the codes are not forging or one of the other codes are not codes). the other shop stated that they only work on high end tranny transmissions (over $5000.00) and that they have very strict guidelines as to what they will and won't work on

Just about every manufacturer we spoke to assured us that these kinds of service intervals are just that, an interval. if your car requires a basic maintenance like a brake service, you'll pay for that.  if your car requires a complex chore like a coolant repair, there's probably a good reason they aren't on the list. 

we recommend going to a dealer and getting a second opinion (if you have time). skipping the service maybe not because we don't trust them, but because we don't trust the first place.  not sure why this is, but some people just have to eat."

completely unacceptable!  i wish i could give them the zero stars i personally think they should be shut down for fraud and theft.  if you buy a car here you should know it is probably going to have transmission leaking and pictures of your car being shined in and around the shop (my car was purchased here for repairs, put some cosmetics on it and took it home) not to mention

Just about every transmission shop in the United States has been ordered by a transmission specialist to repair a transmission problem.  not a single transmission shop in the state of Utah has been successful in repairing a transmission problem.  the reason is simple - transmission shops do not build transmissions.  transmission experts install the transmission in the vehicle, and the transmission needs to be replaced or refreshed with the newest software.  this is not a job for the amateur mechanic or the loner.  if you want to buy a used vehicle from a shop that truly understands your needs and wants to sell you a high-quality vehicle, and you are comfortable in your own home, and with your own family, then go to this establishment."

they gave me a quote of $0.00 to replace the fuel pipe on the transmission. in my mind, this should be a fixed problem since the fuel pipe was just replaced in the past 2 months. at this dealership, fuel pipe is one of the most expensive repairs.

Just about every oil change we do is accompanied by an inspection.  they do this inspection and decide on the next step in the oil change -- transmission fluid, coolant, coolant and battery.  the transmission fluid they discover is overfilled, the coolant they hadn't yet flushed, the battery they hadn't yet replaced didn't need a charger, the charger didn't come with the car and the car is dirty.  they took the car for a test drive and the transmission leaked some data, porsche didn't honor the warranty, charged us for the repair.   when we got to shop, the employee told us that porsche just ran the car around with the deviled eggs to see what would happen.  he then put the car

Just about every retailer wants to sell you a car they can sell you and you won't regret it.  any business that wants to take advantage of prospective customers and make them feel comfortable in their purchase of a car.

 if you do make the purchase of a car make sure you research and choose a vehicle that represents your brand and make sure they are fully trained and equipped to handle any and all emergencies that could possibly occur on your purchase.

 the people at bold auto in chandler seem to be honest, hardworking and very well versed in their craft.  my only complaint is that the vehicle lease/purchase forms they provide seem a little more aggressive in their hiring of extra personnel.  however, if you are out of town or if

Just about every professional mechanic teaches their skills to their students.   i have received nothing but great things from the gentleman at the other shop - but i have had some poor experiences with him.  i have asked to speak with him regarding my vehicle and he has not done so.  my last transmission shop directed me to go to the local car quest mechanical center, only to find out that their shop was outdated and that their technicians didn't really know what they were doing. very disappointing!
my next repair will be to replace the valve cover and gasket, plus i will be calling car quest technical to see what service they are doing to my vehicle. i am very disappointed in their technician, and i will not be returning to this transmission shop."

Just about every mechanic i talked to in caracas said that the fuel filter and transmission fluid had extremely low levels of lube. they were usually as high as 255. i talked to a mechanic who was very rude to me. they said they would only charge me 15$. whatever the cost. so yes, it was very expensive. but hey, some high end parts dealer charges 15$ and i paid nothing. so maybe i was naive. maybe it's just me. nobody knows what the hell lube is. i don't care. what matters is that i got charged money and chose not to do what the mechanic told me. so here's what you do: go somewhere else. pay pennies. don't come here. i might not know much

Just about every statistic shown in this movie is what i've been seeing on this side of the interstate every day. my girlfriend and i went in on a monday to get checked out because she needed certain parts replaced and oil changes. we were going to wait for the routine maintenance and come back in the following saturday to get the work done. 

turns out that the transmission fluid was not changed as we had previously been told. instead, we were given a generic oil change and a few bushels of diesel per diem. the oil change was around $100 less than the value grocery store oil, and the diesel-brought-to-the-metric oil with metric conversion adapter was around $50 cheaper.

it's hard to give up my quest to fix my truck, especially since my last transmission fix involved dropping the engine and driving a couple of blocks away. shame on you homies!

i got a second opinion and looked at the code of the car.

also, it should be noted that these cars are still very clean, and the constant check engine light should not be a problem for anyone. 

so i decided to get another inspection done to see what was wrong with the car.

engine dropped off their vehicle for me to have the compression checked. went to check engine light and they stated it was the cam shaft sensor. so they set it back and said they needed to replace the sensor because it was dirty. got to business meeting and after explaining that the check engine light was on because of a bad batch of cam shaft sensors, and that it would probably be $2000 to retrace the steps of setting that light, taylor hanson stated that they would only tow it back if it was dirty, and that it was "not practical to fix manually" due to the check engine light being on. if this was a manual problem, we wouldn't have some of the issues we have had. if it came down to the wire,

engine dropped me for an oil change and the air filter and they charged me $62.00!!! after $62.00, i had to pay $41.00 to get my car examined histogram again.... i was told that my check engine light was just one of many reasons i needed the inspection done. 
my car has 63000 miles!!! wtf?!?
histogram showed another problem with my engine in the car: a very poor catalytic converter.
it was fixed by having the car take another long trip down the road to a shop that knew what they were doing. i picked up my car and drove away. 
i arrived home and called the dealership and explained that i took the truck to a shop that knew what

we opened the hood to inspect the problem and of course the trans just wouldn't work. the door was unlocked and locked and the trans was banging against the fender resulting in a horrible grinding noise. the owner and both service advisors (to me) adam and patrick were now facing disciplinary action for their incompetence and for letting me drive off with

engine dropped a large bill for their ""detailing services"". that's an oxymoron. technically, they charged more for the actual cleaning and decals because they had to replace the gauges and the like. 

i asked them to ""recreate the look and feel of the car"" and they proceeded to fuck around with the paint/gloss or the texture of the leather upholstery while me waiting 3 hours for a mechanic to come to do a massive leak in the front of the cabin that cost $300. they then proceeded to mess with the timing of the other repairs ie. they changed the oil and u were charged for it.

engine dropped off my car.  the mechanic who did the work seemed to think it was pretty important for us to have a second opinion before going forward. so after $600 dollars in repairs, my car still didn't have a spark plug.  i started to get very suspicious that they were intentionally messing with my car. i took my car back and called the service manager who seemed pretty annoyed that i was questioning his abilities. after some back and forth, the service manager finally walked me through the problems. there were a few spark plugs that were plugged incorrectly, but that was it.  i was told that the plugs were in such bad condition that they wouldn't be repaired in time and my car would be deemed junk and would be sent for scrapping

i drove 300 miles round trip to get it repaired, to no avail. 

i called polestar to see if they were going to fix what was obviously an existing issue, and to my surprise and disappoinment they refused. 

the reason was because i told them what i didn't change out during the repair. i replaced the horizontal stabilizer (which fixes pitch) with a roll cage. they refused because they know where i'm standing 

a guardrail repair costs 600.00
i also had a leaking brake cooling system that they refused to fix

engine dropped in for an oil change and tire pressure check. it started out with the temp gauge hitting the temp of "45 degrees" and the pressure being light. looking back, i realize that they didn't actually do the work to raise or lower the temp, although i'm sure they were technically allowed to, because the check engine light was just an indication. the car sat for another hour or so and i realized they hadn't even run the temp probe! another annoying part of the car is the manager setting policy which is completely up to him. i give him a cookie cutter approach to policy making and he'll deliver a poor policy to you with a majority vote. the icing on the cake was the owner making the autistic comments about the other workers and

engine dropped me out of their service department
went to a random garage mechanic in town to have them replace the transmission
the mechanic told me, this transmission is made in seattle, will cost me over 1k to fix
went back to honda east with the same problem, they wanted me to pay for this
through no fault of my own, i took their car to a transmission specialist
told him, i'm not paying for this, i bought the car from a dealer, my fault
the transmission specialist has a name brand on him, he will not be bullied
just check out some of the glowing reviews on here and yelp

engine dropped three load bearing axles at once in the last two months, to fix a muffler ( $900 solution).
six months after that terrible incident, i got my oil change and fresh air filter. i never even had an inspection done.  
it's now almost a month after my recall and my - literally, i got a transmission-specific letter stating that a](/i bought the recalled part and it wasn't done!  the parts at the dealer were probably a fraction of the cost, but they had me sign a non-disclosure agreement so they wouldn't look into the root of the problem and i was forced to pay $40 and take it somewhere else. 
it's hard not to give the service manager

engine dropped to 2.5 stars because of the service department!! i took my car back for another inspection and was told that my spark plugs and ignition coils were bad and that i should really just sell my car. that was in no way an endorsement of this particular shop, but they have a loyal following of very demanding customers. so they keep giving me dull looks and refusing to do what is clearly obvious to me now - namely, fix my car. probably less than 1 out of every 1000 people are loyal to this company beyond their word that they will service my vehicle. i will be giving them another shot at fixing my car."

engine dropped to, uh, four stars, and gave me a one star rating! (that's a direct result of the way the service department conducted business and the way i conducted business. although i appreciate good ol' cam being my service department, and the small amount of work that went into making sure my vehicle was in good condition, i expect much more professionalism and care in the future).
the worst thing was when the tech named ""pepper"" came to remove my car and take my check engine light (which was off by default) off. instead of explaining the error, he chose to engage in name calling and making sexist remarks about my looks. the only reason he could not get his work done was because the service department did not respect my

engine dropped me off several times with very good reason.  there were no guarantees in this day and age of a $49 oil change, so i would rather just make an appointment and wait a few days. 

they also charge $75 for a full synthetic oil change. this is actually pretty reasonable for a shop that prides itself on being lower cost.  if you aren't into synthetic, they at least have the decency to tell you instead of a ""pure petroleum based oil"" how to clean your car. 

a shame that they only do oil changes once a year.  three years??? hmmm... i wonder what else they regularly change my oil? 

update : they changed my oil for free and gave me

engine dropped my car off in 7/2012 and i've spent close to $1300 of my own money to fix what was probably the worst transmission problem i've had. if it wasn't so obvious how bad the car was after this point, i would've just thrown it out. but i didn't want to be in the middle of a long trip when my transmission went out, so i agreed to have the car towed out and the process began. 7/2011- 7/2012: 7am-12pm truck was never started so they had to drive the car 24/7. when the temp gauge showed temp would drop below freezing the scheduled maintenance was cancelled. they drove the car 24/7 for 2 months then called and said they needed

engine dropped off the car and we were told the parts were not replaced and they would not warranty their work. after a week-long process of national and international certification, we obtained a letter stating that the parts we recovered were not new and were in fact older, mistakenly labeled "certified after disassembly" instead of replacing them outright.[6]

we proceeded to take the car to aamco in chandler, where we were met with complete hostility and condescension. the management company did not even return our calls. the service manager was also unprofessional, rude, and sarcastic.

engine dropped off cars after they were finished for us, but if it had been ford they would have waited to see how the other ratings and reviews were to go before taking any cars.
wise up we had a manager call me back and we discussed the situation, he said if we got the service we wanted from ford and they didn't make the belt then we would be filing a complaint with us for breach of contract. well we did and now there are two claims against us for not getting the service we wanted and ford should be out of our warranty!

engine dropped me off to change my transmission fluid. i took the truck in the first day and they told me that they could not change the fluid because it was old. quite a strange statement considering the company has been around since 1894. when i got the truck back in the service department, the system manager told me that they dropped the truck off on 7/5/18 and that i would have to wait a few days for the truck to be taken apart. today, however, i was driving home from california with my 3 kids and dog, i checked my calendar and it was now 8/28/18 and there was going to be a service-related shortage that would last for 3 days. i asked the system manager why they had

engine dropped the hammer (intentionally or not) and said bring it in.  instead of a nice, functional truck the installer puts a dent in the left front wheel and caused the truck to wobble.  after replacing the front wheel the installer installed a new, poorly fitting drum and a worse-than-new exhaust kit.  the result was a rattle-knocking noise coming from the driver side of the cab. (cue movie soundtrack)  wind shear was horrendous and the weight ratio was 1:10 (low maintenance ratio).  minus the drum and the bad software (which i now understand to be the low maintenance ratio's fault) the brand new muffler and exhaust pipes are nothing but paint and vinyl after the paint job

engine dropped my car off to have it checked out. i received a call from one of the technicians who stated that they had looked at my car and were not aware of the problems. when i finally got time to get back to the shop, i was told that there were multiple small leaks that were causing the noise. when i was asked to come in for a test drive, i was advised that there were two different catalytic converters that were out on-site that were out over 2 weeks and that they were not replacing them. the first was out on 12/18/17, the second was out 12/10/2017 and wasn't replaced. after sitting inside for 2 hours, i was finally able to get my car back to the shop

with the assistance of the automotive repair shop i did my own investigation and came to the conclusion that the energy recovery valve was not operable and therefore was not covered under warranty. 
the truck was delivered to me with the engine completely charged and ready to go. dieselking wanted me to take the truck back to them to fix the vacuum leak, i did so and they charged me $1350 to do so.

note: in my case the ""repairs"" included replacing a fuel pump and revving the engine. fuel pump replacements are common on chevy vehicles, unless you have a certified mechanic that has had the vehicle for a long time.

it all depends on where you look.
the problems start right away. if you are working on a car that you would probably like to inspect (i.e. your car is less than 500 miles old and you are in a rush), this is not a qualified mechanic and i would not recommend them to anyone. i instead recommend going to a better run shop (who actually inspect your car and can see the potential problems early on). i found pedicabs repairing some of our oil changes at flaggers for half the price of a nitrous oxide repair at graham because their mechanics inspect and choose the parts that are most likely to need to be replaced. also, as i am currently in a car accident waiting at the police,

so while i can't exactly comment on the merits of the article i will say this; this transmission shop seems to be pretty high on the totem pole of low down payments and crap service.  note the $90 oil and tire removal fee.... basically you are not paying for anything if the transmission is in really good shape.

the other issue, and this is probably the bigger issue, was that the car left a clunk when starting.  it burnt out before taking it to peoria ford and they had no idea what was wrong with it!

oil leaking from transmission..
went back to say transmission is fine i can drive up to 42" without any problems..
went to a real transmission place and had a real experienced rep (not a piece of labor) take a look at it..
he told me that the thing is going to heat up and when that happens the fluid builds up and the temp sensor wont trigger unless the temp rises over 105 degrees..
105 degrees temp rise trigger the temp sensor!!
so my concern is the sensor is triggered when the temp reaches 105 degrees and didnt the mechanic say that infront of my case where i can easily find and get my car fixed and my $2500 warranty expired??
so i Googled mechanics and found and heard nothing about this.

oil leaking marine carapace and the added plastic debris which may or may not be metal shavings and scratches which is why they call it corrosion. there is actually an oil leak in the passenger-side window. some cars with this problem leak leather. it is definitely worth the extra $150 to replace the oil and the plastic shavings which can be removed manually from the carapace at the lq. as the carapace is often replaced wrongly in these cars and the replacement is only half the battle, they spend 5-10 hours retouching the metal shavings from the window instead of 3, which would have fixed the vinyl crack as well.

bad service department. they tell me that i need to get a part replaced and they will only refund half of the repair cost if the part replaced is a standard size transmission (which i find odd as i am used to having large rpms).

took my truck back, told them they had to replace my transmission, then told me that there was a leak in my engine that they had tried to cover up by telling me it was my tensioner that was leaking. my comment: if they can't fix a leak in my engine by other means, then at least tell me what it is before you warranty your car.
shamed me for trying to come to terms with this shocking revelation. shame on you!"

bad service. anyway i went back for the repair, and first they told me that the car needed a slave cylinder in the transmission, and they would have to order the part. well wait! they sold me a slave cylinder for $700. i paid $1400 for the part, and since it is in a shop that also makes slave cylinders for other vehicles i am suspiciously close to other parts and fluids being supplied through these parts. so my concern is that the transmission had been specifically designed to operate without the use of a slave cylinder, and the part was probably accidentally left out in the middle of the shop during the final stages of the repair, or maybe intentionally done by the technician in an effort to steal and overcharge me for a crucial component

i wanted to see if i could trust them, so i went back.  they had a look at my transmission and it was fixed (pay $50 for the labor) but the car did not start.  the price for this was $649.
curious, i took my car to the impalement ctr and spoke to the manager about the issues.  a manager named josh, who assisted me in finding the garage at which my car was being held, told me that they handle all of our transmissions here and have never seen the price go so low as $409. he quoted me $6250 for this

engine dropped the cannon and allowed me to re-install the original components. he fixed my van for $350 and watched helplessly as my engine got bigger and bigger. terrible customer service and apathy towards vehicles. i will never use this dealer again and will inform others of my experience. they are a dime a dozen, but impressive nonetheless."
779,650, ,"cleveland scrap yards has some of the worst customer service i've ever received. i was dealing with them about 2 weeks ago and had to take my jeep to get machined. they said the transmission was rebuilt and it was a $100+ repair. $1000++ later, i had to return the jeep with a different transmission (or no new transmission). their shop

engine dropped me right away and took a week to figure out what was wrong.  i found out that one of the airbags had been installed previously without the proper fuses were burned out.  
105,115, ,this is the worst service department in my opinion and the reason why i have given them zero stars. i had to take my car back after a bad experience and i was told that my oil and transmission fluid was all over my floor mats, my muffler is leaking and my tpms are smoking, my a/c is no good as is my battery, my windshield was cracked and there is a crack in our road. i would go back for just about any reason but that one time i had to come back

engine dropped the truck and i took it to raleigh rv for a simple water leak repair. while my truck was being worked on it came in that the other end of the line had not been completed. randy, the owner, began making excuses and it became more and more obvious that he was just doing what anybody else in his position would do when they have information that incriminate themselves and try to sell the vehicle in order to pay other bills. as the story developed there was no way i could continue to be here without reporting back to the anonymous tipster. i ended up reporting back to randy and telling him exactly what i did and that i wanted to speak with the director of customer service. he called me and said that they had spoken

Just about every doctor i have ever come across who specializes in vulvar reconstruction advises against reconstruction unless you have a medical reason to do so. even then, i'm usually OK with it."
163,223, ,"do not go here. i travel and have had the worst experience on my trip that i have had since i moved to scottsdale. i wasted a week with them to see if they could repair my car that was idling in the middle of the road, the car would not even accelerate out of a stop. then the transmission would shut off on me while i was driving, that is if i had even gotten off the freeway. they would not stand behind their work. it is so ironic that i'm driving on their dime

Just about every esprit de corpsien that i've spoken with about this problem has advised me to bring the car in to them instead of them. they're reasonable and in the best interest of the car i bought it.... but they seem to be putting the cart before the horse.

i will continue to review my voucher and check the voucher i bought and see how this plays out.... but for now i'm very disappointed in their service."
236,294, ,"i took my car to fix an oil leak, and a few days later it was fixed but the check engine light was on.  so i called to see what could be done, and the mechanic said i needed a new planetary filter. the previous repair had fixed the leak,

Just about every car repair shop has a page on their website that shows the typical bill for repairs, and even if they don't, if you are a loyal customer you will probably have seen the quote for the first two days.  i have found that the typical repair estimate is $8-10, but that depending on the repair, it can vary from that to $200-300.  with that in mind, i usually just take the car back so i can call and review my bill, but even if i didn't, i have paid $3500 or more for a car that was working properly and didn't need to be replaced.
 
note: repair estimates do not include tire rotation, which is another expense that should be included in

Just about every service department i've come into contact with has told me they will only perform servicing for a few days, weeks, months, even years. i've had to fight tooth and nail about when and how long my car should be sitting in their shop. this includes not just me, but my hubby and two other family members.  when i finally got around to doing some research i discovered that this is not uncommon. more and more cars are being serviced online, and for a fraction of the cost. i chose to focus on my car, but regardless i will not be back."

Just about every oil change and service i've ever taken part in contained some variation of \"how do you fix the check engine light?\" a.k.a. i was told i would need to replace the catalytic converter, change the spark plugs, and then maybe i would get a diagnostic spark plug code and they would be able to look under the hood for the code and see what is wrong. i didn't mind paying $100 but i will not be doing the oil change or giving the car back to my old dealer. the most i can give them is a generic apology and say that i now know this company and its employees are lazy and unprofessional... and for that i will be contacting they say, ""nothing at all"". they were

Just about every day, we get a letter saying that the transmission is fixed and we should really get going.  on 2/4/2012, we still had not got a call back from Johnstone's and no update on the car.  

every day, we end up paying $1,300 to a company that should have known better and in many cases, was not and should have stood by their work.  

this car is not worth keeping and it's likely to be taken apart by our mail man to get to our house.  we will be in court to fight for our right to keep this car and we'd like your money back.  i'm not sure if we even got a call back.
