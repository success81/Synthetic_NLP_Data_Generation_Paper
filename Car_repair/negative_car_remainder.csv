0,negative,"tried to have my car repaired.  even made an appointment.  i was told that all my appointment was for is to meet the service advisor, not get any work completed on my car.  such a waste of time.  even talked to the service manager, he didn't care.  since that was the attitude of the service department, i can only expect that from the mechanics that would have worked on my car.  went to another dealership, made an appointment and my car went in to be repaired.  not told to come back later and they might get to my car. very poor service."
309,negative,i had a customer bring there vehicle in for a roaring noise which turned out to be an internal issue with the transmission. we decided to give all pro a shot at rebuilding this transmission for my customer. the job took them a week with them telling me that they were waiting for parts to come in. i later found out that jim was lying to me and that whitey screwed something up and had to take it to another transmission shop to fix the problem. my customer brought the vehicle back several times complaining of a rattle noise coming from the engine. turned out that the transmission was so screwed up from all pro transmissions that it was putting a load on the engine causing it to die. after several attempts to get jim at all pro to repair this correctly i had to send it to a real transmission shop for an entire rebuild again. jim refuses to make good on this job telling me one excuse and lie after another. i only wish that these reviews allowed zero stars cause i wouldn't let these clowns work on a skateboard!
310,negative,"all pro does provide a free diagnostic and quote. which includes the mechanic taking the transmission apart. however, the year warranty the shop provides with the repair is worthless. my check engine light immediately came on after leaving the shop. i took my truck back immediately. i was given a ridiculous excuse and i believe they reset the code. the light came back on the next day and they ran the codes again. i was told the codes were for the knock sensor and o2 sensor. i was told to go to another shop for those repairs. long story short this shop i was referred to wanted to charge me $1500 to repair the sensors. i didn't pay it. i got another opinion and the second shop found that the electrical lines running along side the transmission appeared to be pinched between some metal. they believed that was the culprit and the sensors did not need replacing. i went back to all pro as suggested by the second shop and was given excuses and they failed to look at my truck again to resolve the issue. i paid $2500 to have my transmission replaced with all pro, i thought i could trust them. i was wrong."
311,negative,"never ever take your vehicle to this auto center. brought my car in to have oil changed. it was running fine when they took it in. when they gave it back it no longer ran. started it up, check engine light came on, (not maintenance required that needs resetting after each oil change.) and then the car died. no one cares said it was nothing they did and walked away. said they weren't mechanics. total lack of courtesy blew me away."
312,negative,"there's nothing more annoying than someone wasting my time. two things: needed a xzilon touch up as the job was not satisfactory, also my check engine light was on. 

i had the code checked, and i did my research of how much the part cost and how long it would take to fix it. easy fix, however i have a warranty - so i brought it in.  dropping the jeep off, i told the guy exactly what needed fixed, and spoke about the parts and the warranty in detail. apparently because i am female, they thought they could fuck with me.... they later called, reporting it will be $300 to fix (the part cost $20, and a 20 minute fix). i told him he's out of his fucking mind, this is covered under my warranty and i am not paying that. he continued to ask if i wanted the work done, and i declined as i refuse to pay $300 for a $20 part and easy fix, as well as this is covered under the warranty.  at this point, the man told me i needed to pay $97 for the fee of having the code read. this is a free service at any auto parts store - i already had the problem identified. again, trying to take advantage of a woman at the service dept.  i refused to pay for that as well.  the guy response was ""well then why did you bring the jeep in!?""  again - because it's covered under my warranty but i guess you're too damn lazy to address the problem appropriately. 
so, i arrived to pick up my jeep, opened the door. theres no odor. the xzilon application is a chemical, in which smells for days. theres still hair on the seats, items in the jeep weren't moved or touched. water marks still on the seats when i did my ""repel test"" (xzilon is a protectant which repels liquid... if they ever do it correctly). clearly, they did not address the xzilon at all. walking back into the service dept, i blatantly asked if they had addressed the xzilon.  ""uh, well, yeah. they did.""  they had absolutely no intention of addressing the xzilon, even after i called them out on the job they didn't do."
313,negative,"scam of a company. in my life i have never dealt with such a horrendous company. it's no shock to me that the bell road location shut down because they are crooks and people are catching on to their shady business practices. have any of these sales and accountants had any experience whatsoever in selling vehicles?  we bought a used truck about a year ago and every single thing that could go wrong with it, has gone wrong with it. the a.c. had to have been fixed 3 times, the transmission went out, the power windows went out, the muffler fell off, the hubcaps were missing..you name, it has happened to us. the accountant at the bell road location was the most unprofessional, disrespectful individual i have ever done business with. 

they sold us a complete lemon and overcharged us by roughly six thousand dollars and kept promising to fix the truck but never followed through. your company is a joke and i hope more people come forward to expose you for the soulless thieves that you are. 

i am reporting this company to the better business bureau. how can you can make false promises to your customers and taking them for every cent they have knowing full well that what you're selling them is essentially a death trap? this business needs to be shut down.  do not shop here. you will regret it."
314,negative,"dont waste your money with these guys. they will play nice at first, that jd guy and patrick. they wont fix your car, unless you pay an extra $5,000. even then, theres still a possibility it wont be fix. i paid almost $3000 for my check engine to be removed, and still nothing. i went to bmw only, the check engine light is gone and i just paid $700. never again. also that patrick guy is liar! he told he replaced my batter with a new one, turns out he lied. my uncle is a mechanic and when we looked at it, its the same one from 7 years ago. that's malpractice and lying. he should get fired."
315,negative,"if i could give negative stars i would. after spending over 3k last year on""repairs"" to my 03 c230, my check engine light is still on. now i have new problems and there are hanging wires & electrical issues. my car was fine when i came for the smog they ""gave"" me & had never given me issues until immediately after i got the smog. since i thought it was cool of them to comp my smog & because they are so close to my home, i thought i would give them a shot at fixing the check engine light. i hadn't made the connection with the timing at that point. plus i had them put new brakes in ($900+) the prior year and figured maybe they would give me a break on my repeat business. nope.
they told me that ""because it's a benz, it's going to be $1700, to get it done"". so i had to finance the repairs. i was told it was going to take a couple of days for the parts to come in from fletcher jones, to complete the financing paperwork, and then bring the car back at the end of the week. the receptionist that assisted me with the financing advised me to call before bringing the car back to be sure they had the parts. meanwhile, since i had signed the paperwork, they got paid. sure enough, when i phoned friday, no parts yet. 
i called again the following wednesday to see if they had the parts. nope. finally, over 2 weeks after the $1500 (+400 paid in cash for a coolant reservoir i never needed) the parts had mostly come in, & they expected the last one in by friday. i could drop the car off, and it might take a day or two to get it done.
i drop the car and after a week without my daily driver, and $1700, they give me the car back. as soon as i start the car, you guessed it! the check engine light is on again! ugh!
i have been to two other garages and now nobody wants to touch it because it's ""been tampered with"". that's a literal direct quote from 2 benz mechanics. the same exact words. beware of the smog deal!!! i now need a new car. plus i am out a bunch of $$."
316,negative,"awful!  just awful.

took my car in on an engine recall and told them car was not running right at all.  they ""checked it out"" and told me absolutely nothing was wrong with it.  right as i drove out of the lot, my car started to stall and was running really rough.  i called back right then and jamie said for them to look at it again, it would cost me $179!!  made no sense.  

just two days later, i took it to larry miller hyundai on bell road, and they said the engine recall was valid and that the pistons were bent and there was a small hole in the cam shaft.  the engine was no good and they are currently replacing the entire engine.  

how could chapman hyundai miss this glaring problem and send me on my way!!!??? very dangerous and inept.  

i will be notifying hyundai corporate about chapman once larry miller gets my car repaired and i am able to clearly see what chapman missed and how they could have done this.  

i will never go here again and would advise any of you to go elsewhere.  anywhere else but here!"
317,negative,"horrible customer service. never fixed the vehicle, replaced some part but didn't replace another that we were charged for (refunded that portion) but they didn't actually do what they said they were going to do which was diagnose, pinpoint issue and fix and no refund for all of that and no apologies. now taking vehicle to someone who also said this place gives other transmission companies a bad name. i wonder how many other people they charged for parts that they didn't actually replace?!!"
318,negative,"beware , beware . beware our transmission on our dodge truck went out on our way to northern california in the middle of the desert near death valley we looked for someone to fix it in las vegas and had it towed to el jesse transmissions . he said he could have it fixed the next day 4 days later he said it was done . we drove 500 miles and the transmission broke . we called jesse and he said he would pick the truck up that never happened . then he said he would send us a new transmission that never happened . he never returned phone calls as to how he was going to take care of this as we were stranded in california with no transportation 
then he said it was our truck that caused the rebuild that made it go bad and had not even looked at it after it broke
we had no choice as weeks went buy and no resolution and no return phone calls from jesse it was clear he was not going to warranty his work we had to take it to another shop they rebuilt it again and said there were stuff in there that was done improperly . we paid el jesse 3625.00 to rebuild the transmission and broke down 500 miles after rebuild .we had to pay another 3800.00 to redo his shotty workmanship . he will not pay the bill to rebuild the transmission nor give us a refund that they did not do correctly and will only warranty his work in his shop but we were stranded 500 miles from his shop and had no way to get the truck back to him . 

now we have to sue him to get a refund"
319,negative,"consider finding another transmission repair shop if you need your vehicle fixed properly the first or even the second time and in a timely fashion. family member was out of state for extended period of time, so we volunteered to help pick up their vehicle after transmission repair. after over 3 weeks of being in for transmission rebuild,  picked up vehicle only to have problems the next day. would not go in reverse. took vehicle back to all pro. picked vehicle up again after a couple weeks, only to have a leak from transmission and given excuses for the leak. one more trip to all pro. after not hearing anything 3 weeks later, was told vehicle would be delivered to our house since we lived in west valley.  another week passed, no vehicle delivered, called and again told vehicle would be brought to house by tow truck or jim, himself, would personally drive vehicle to our house. tow truck dropped off vehicle, unfortunately while we weren't at home. came home to find vehicle would not start, dead battery. not a surprise since vehicle sat at repair shop for 5 weeks. now the waiting game to see if any additional transmission problems arise after driving vehicle"
320,negative,"brought my transmission in there because it was leaking from the front pump.  i told them to go through it, was quoted $550.00, ended up $850.00. now the transmission is much worse than when i brought it to them.  had to pay another $250.00 plus fluids and labor for the valve body they messed up.  i gave them the go ahead to put the shift kit in it, they say it works as it should.  well if no downshift when you step on the gas, or a downshift when you are not stepping on the gas driving at 60 miles an hour with constant pedal, then it's right. oh yes, and the no overdrive or the shift from 1st to 3rd, bypassing 2nd, thats all corect according to them. this place is about 70 miles from my house, had to get my car towed to them after they did the transmission and they still can't get it right.  they talk a great game, but when it comes to fixing their mistakes, you will get no help from them.  stay away, stay far away."
321,negative,greg shmuck is a lier cheat and thief of the highest order. i fell victim to his switch and bate scam like the others.and has stolen my personal property from my truck. he promised to beat anyone's prices.he quoted me 1500. to repair my transmission. with nothing but a phone quote .told me that 600. would be applied to the repair of 1500. then removed the transmission.disabeling my truck. and then told me it would be 3000. or 600. to get my truck back with a disassembled trans.his machanics are incompetent.they are more like body guards. all certifications are fake. angie's list and bbb all bull. they don't repair. they have found a legal way to rip honest hard working people.by disablilng vehicles and holding them ransom @ 600. a pop.he has hi own impound yard. they allowed me to remove my personal possessions on one day. on the next day i was to return to remove my diamond plated tool box ladders and ladder rack. when i arrived my bed box and ladders had been removed. i said let me guess you sold my tool box to an employee. his response was yeah something like that with a smug expression. he said it was gone. i saw were he was hidding my ladders.i asked if i could have them. he said he would sell me my ladders. i started taking a lot of pics. and called the police. he ran like the coward he is.i came back to meet the police on 10-15-18. just in time to photo hi employee putting my ladders in hi truck to get them off the premises. i approached him and told him he had been photoed.and h quickly removed the ladders just as the police arrived. the police convinced him to let me have the ladders.but said he doesn't know what happened to the toolbox. not only that i have photos of my military decals pealed off my truck. how low can you go. rip people off steal there personal stuff and desigrat the armed forces and a man's dignity and valor how discrasfull .this coward never served a day.im going to sue that pos for larsany or theft .he has been investigated by 3 on your side and hid like a coward.hides from the police like a coward. his shop was riddled with bullets about 5 ys ago.he has many charges against him and yet his business practices remain. i'm on a mission to make his life hell on pure principal. even if it costs me. your welcome to join me. the attorney general needs to be contacted. maybe together we can put him out of business. and put him out of his expensive hummer trophy and paradise valley home.and into bankruptcy or a cell were he belongs.
322,negative,"i took my 2001 ford truck in a few days ago, i took it in when i didn't know what the problem was, they told me that there was a problem with my transmission and that they had now fixed it. they fixed it just good enough to run but now my ac and doesn't work and it has trouble shifting gears. but the thing that makes give them only one star (i wish i could give a lower score) is the fact that my emergency cash hidden in my glove box mysteriously disappeared while in there shop. chuck, the owner i believe, assured me that nobody could have taken it because it was locked in there garage the whole time and he pays his people enough so that they would not need to take my 100 dollars. the money isn't even the part that makes me the most upset, along with the cash was a picture that my little brother had given me years ago and i cared a lot about. that somehow disappeared with cash and ipod to radio adapter. use anywhere but here."
323,negative,"this would review would be titled ""bait and switch"". i recently met zeke at hoopers used auto parts and after my experience with him and this business, i will never be going back again and will be sharing my story with everyone that is looking for parts. they do not even earn a single star. i work in the automotive field as a certified ase master technician for a company in charlotte and have never seen the horrible business ethics and customer service they have recently showed me. so i recently called zeke with hoopers and asked if they had a transmission with transfer case for my 4x4 toyota and price. zeke replied back saying yes when have what you need, make an offer. so i offered, zeke counter-offered and then we came upon an agreement to meet half way with price. so i then replied saying i would be there with cash for correct amount and leaving early from my work in charlotte to be there in time before close of business that day. so i rushed and drove the 68 miles from my work to go pick up the transmission assuming i was getting. once i got there, i asked to speak to zeke, he then asked me what price did we agree on? immediately i knew he was going to play games with me by asking that statement, so i said what we agreed on and zeke replied by saying that he did not agree on that price and couldn't sell it for that. then he asked what the price was for and i said it was for the toyota 4x4 trans with transfer case. zeke then replied, ""you never said transfer case"". so by now i felt like i was just getting played and since i drove all that way and had cash ready to drive off with parts, i was really starting to get irritated. zeke then stated he could sell me the trans for what we agreed upon but transfer case would be additional. i then told zeke that i only had in cash what we agreed on over the phone before i made the 68 mile drive here. zeke the replied saying, ""no one told you, you had to make the drive here"". at that point, i would rather cut my losses and drive all the way back home, than give a penny to a company that talks and treats a customer in this way. therefor i am spreading the word as much as i can. 

 do not waste your time with this buisness, they will do you wrong. hopefully this saves a trip for anyone thinking about going there for parts again.

 on a lighter note, fernando at salvage auto supply in charlotte, nc (704)333-1007, was extremely helpful and very courteous. excellent customer service and 3x longer warranty than hoopers. they will definitely be seeing me as a returning customer."
324,negative,"took my car in for a check engine light, received a call a day later saying i would needed a new engine because my oil was low and they found metal in the oil which was the issue.  told me it would be 8k for a new engine and labor.  after hearing this i took the car to a dealership for a second opinion, dealership said the check engine light was an engine misfire most likely cause by bad spark plugs.  spark plugs replaced but misfires continued.  found a shop that actually ran tests that would diagnose the problem, needed a new head gasket.  head gasket was fixed, saved myself $6,000 and car runs great.  have driven over 5k+ miles on an ""engine that needs to be replaced"" with no problems.  basically wilhelm charged me for a diagnostic and never found the problem, just escalated it to i needed a new engine.  not sure if they even ran any other tests for the check engine light."
325,negative,"this mr lube is located south of major mackenzie on yonge street and generally has a lot of customers. if you don't already know, mr.lube is sort of known for being more expensive and ""higher"" class, they'll give you a paper, coffee or whatever as you're waiting and the service is done while you sit in your car. fast and great, huh? after i came to this mr.lube, my car check engine light went on... now i take very good care of my car, it's never had a check engine light go on...

went here for an oil change... went back and they said that there's something wrong with the exhaust pipe... don't trust this mr lube. scam!!!

0/5"
326,negative,"this place is your classic ripoff and the guy at the front desk, apparently the owner, tried to hit on me while he lied through his teeth telling me i needed to replace my transmission. i went there after buying a used vehicle and knew there were going to be issues because of the deal i got, so i swung in here because i was nearby and had previously been to a good aamco. afterwards, i went to my regular shop and they told me in 10 minutes the engine mounts were shot, including the tranny mount and that's likely why i was getting some shaking. 

in any case, these guys are sheisters. stay away"
327,negative,"i called knowing it is a transmission shop but wanted to know if i could get an oil change. the owner told me my synthetic oil is $9 per quart. that's fine, i have a tiny car. how much could it really be? i paid $55 for an oil change in february and i wasn't happy to pay that much. so if my car takes 4.5 quarts the math is that is about $50 and the filter could be why $10 if it's a really high end filter. that brings it to about $65 generously. im assuming it costs an additional $40 to have someone remove a bolt, dispose of old oil and put in a new filter and 4.5 quarts of oil? moral of the story if you're a female don't come here for something simple. i get that they do more complex stuff but reaming people on oil changes should be more upfront. they made a 100% markup on me and i'm sure they feel great about it. i'd like to have known this $55 oil change would be $100 sooner than once they're ""half way done doing it"""
328,negative,"beware. brought my altima in for service as it was closing in on 200k miles. needed an oil change for a long trip. a random employee pointed to my car, shaking his finger with a smile, as i was checking out and stated i would need a new car soon. he knew something. 2 weeks later the transmission went. scott clarks name is now dead to me and i will never purchase another nissan, or even another japanese car again. i know most cars are built to be obsolete in 10 years but when they actually go longer it seems they are intentionally killed at the dealer."
329,negative,"this place will rip you off ,do not go there.paid 1980.00 only to find out that they had taped over the check engine light. my car didn't pass smog so i took it to the mechanic the smog place suggested and when they removed the console plate to check the computer there was black tape over the check engine light so as to make it look like it was not on when i picked up my car. the mechanics there purposely did this and i have the pics to prove it.i took it there because the problem was the check engine light and the car was running sluggish. i was told by the mechanics at the other shop that a lot of mechanics do this to rip you off and make you think the problem is solved.will never visit another ted wiens ever and will continue to tell every one i know about this awful place here in las vegas on rainbow blvd.beware vegas.."
330,negative,"i would rate them a negative star if i could. they ripped me off and fixed something on my car that wasn't even broken. they charged me over $500 to fix something that didn't need to be fixed. then when my probably wasn't fixed i went back to them, they found another issue and tried to charge me full price to fix the thing that was actually broken on my car! i had to fight them for a silly 20% discount! that's it...only 20%. then after they fixed my car another issue started and i had to go back and have my car repaired again! another inconvenience!! at least this time they determined it was a faulty part and under warranty and didn't charge me. this is a good thing, because i wouldn't have given them another dime. do not go here!!"
331,negative,"went in for transmission flush, and apparently my coolant had been completely drained as well. left this facility without any knowledge drove up north and jeep was overheating. 

called in today to speak to manager and make him aware of the situation. he became very irate (yelling) and implied that it must have been my fault (great customer service by the way), luckily for me i just had all fluids topped off at chrysler/jeep superstition not even an hour prior to taking it to fletchers and have full report from them. only went for 30% off ad, which i ended up paying for anyways at jeep for coolant afterwards."
332,negative,"worst customer service. unless you are in the market to but a vehicle, no one returns calls or offers any customer service. several calls and emails sent to schedule an end of lease inspection on my 2016 hyundai equus.  spoken to sales manager, who refers me to the service advisor, whi then transfers me back to the sales manager. grrrrr. 
this vehicle has been a lemon since i obtained it. they have replaced the battery, air conditioner actuator and the transmission module. i had to contact the manufacturer to get them to honor their warranty and replace the unsafe transmission.  the car has 28,950 miles on it. looks like new. not a scratch or a ding. 
poor customer service is why i went back to lexus in november and purchased a luxury edition and am so happy that i did!"
333,negative,"this particular big o, is run by a number of scammers.  i took my car to get a transmission flush done.  they left my transmission overfilled by a quart.  i had to take it back and it was still overfilled when i left.  i bought a card from a solicitor from this company which included a number of free services.  i asked the seller if i would be able to provide my own oil (syn) and filter and all they would need to do is the labor.  the seller said that would be fine.  so i bought the card and a week later i go to store to get service done.  

as soon as i mentioned that i had that 'discount' card, the guy behind the counter is like ""well let's go outside and take a look at the car"".  we go outside and he says that one of my tires needs to be changed.  he says that he doesn't even feel safe driving it into the shop (the tire had some cracks, but the tread was perfectly fine, no balding or uneven wear.  it was fine).  so i agree and we go inside and he gives me a quote.  he tells me that they only have on tire in stock and it's $128.  it's a dodge stratus with standard tires and stock rims.  i ask him why it's so expensive and he says that it's because the speed rating is an s and that all the tires need to keep the same speed rating.  i did not realize it at the time but i bought two other tires for the car from this same big o and they were $87.  so i decide that i'm going to take the car somewhere else to get the tire.  

i took it to discount tire and got a tire for $88. took it back to the big o tire to get the service i had originally taken it in for (oil change and tire balance).  the same guy tells me that it's the company's policy that they must use their own oil and filter.  so i told them that's fine and i ask them to do the tire balance.  he tells me that even though i have a card for one free tire balance that they are still going to charge me $3 per weight used because they need to use aluminum weights since my rims are aluminum alloy.  the rims had lead weights on them already.  i've never even heard of aluminum weights being used to balance a tire.  so i figured at that point that the person was lying to me and just wanted to take my money and probably wouldn't have even done the service anyways.  

i immediately took my dodge to the big o on rock springs.  huge difference in service.  i was greeted immediately when i arrived.  i told him that i wanted to do tire balance and that i had a card for a free tire balance.  they took the coupon, offered a few other services which i turned down and they proceeded to do the tire balance....  for free.  

i called corporate to notify them of the disparity of the two stores.  i don't think they cared much.  they asked what i wanted them to do and all i asked for was a refund for the card i bought, to which the agreed.  frankly i don't trust any repair shop too much, but this repair shop i believe is short changing it's customers if not steeling.  i don't blame big o as a corporation, but this one at centennial is one to avoid."
334,negative,"my entire experience with getting my vehicle serviced here led to me being treated like garbage and being told my only option was to spend $9,000.00 to get a new engine in my 2014 chevrolet equinox. don was my service representative and he is perfect at scamming you for all of your money. 

i had to get my car towed to this service center and after even calling an hour before my appointment to check my vehicle in, my car was forgotten about. the receptionist said over the phone that don, my service representative would call me back to update me on what was wrong with my car. after three hours, i called back only to find out my appointment had been canceled and he couldn't get to it until the next day. when i finally received the call the next day, the only information don would give me was that my engine was dead and i should consider buying a new car. no other details on what he found wrong with my engine. 

after discussing the cost, he only ever offered me what now i have found out to be the most expensive new engine. there was absolutely never a discussion on the options i would have as far as finding another used engine or something a little cheaper. i had to fix this for $9,000.00 or find a new vehicle. 

when i went to go pick up my vehicle after going through with the repair, i was met with a "" not to be sexist or anything, but do you know how to even check your engine oil?"" and when i stared at him he added "" i mean , do you have a boyfriend who can do it? "" i have never been met with such abrasive behavior about not knowing how to do something. i was hoping to be taught something i never learned how to do, so i could take better care of my car. though being treated like a dumbass when going to pick my car up after paying that much money to get it fixed really rubbed me the wrong way. when he went to show me how to do it finally, there was still a rag sitting on top of my brand new engine from it being fixed. it otherwise would have gone unnoticed and caused problems in the future. 

24 hours later, my check engine light came back on. when i took it back the next morning, don did a free engine diagnostic but told me that he didn't see anything. so, he turned the light off for me and told me to call him back if it ever turned back on. another 24 hours later it turned back on. 

this entire situation already started making me feel like i had been scammed. i was met with complete hostility and abrasiveness. so i took my car to another chevrolet dealership to get it looked at. within a minute of them doing another engine diagnostic, i had found out my cat converter had failed. when was don going to tell me about this or let me just continue driving around until i was ready to shovel more money at him for my car being even more damaged?

when inspecting the work, they also found that my entire engine had been put back in too tightly, which allowed for both o2 censors to be stripped. don was convinced that my engine failed because i let it run without engine oil, even though i had just gotten an oil change recently before this problem. the final dealership i went to inspected my cars history and was convinced that my original engines problems could have been a long term effect instead of what don's reasoning was.

 either way, i will never know what really happened to my original engine. this was a costly mistake that taught me a hard lesson. don should not be trusted with big repairs or with servicing your vehicle in general, due to his inability to communicate properly to customers what the problem is and his inability to use basic customer service skills.  this service center scams you out of money and pushes you into a corner making you think you have no other option. while i could have walked away without getting my car fixed, i was hoping that by going to a chevrolet dealership over another mechanic meant i would be finding the best  option to getting my equinox fixed."
335,negative,used to be my go to place for all my car services.  over the last year things have gone down hill.  customer service is poor now even down to bad attitudes on the phone when trying to make appointment.   my last straw was a recent quote for transmission service that was a full $1000 more then 2 other quotes.   sad that this place went down hill they used to be amazing.
336,negative,"i brought my car in because the check engine light came on stating it was a small vapor leak in the fuel system. they quoted me $60 to find out what was wrong with it. brought it in, and they couldn't find the problem because they needed to a more extensive smoke test to find where the leak was which costs $200. however they said they would deduct the first $60 from the cost and credit the total diagnostic expenses toward the repair. i brought it back for the smoke test and they stated a gasket at the fuel sending unit needed to be replaced which was a $25 part. total cost was around $240 with taxes. as soon as i drove home, the check engine light came on again for the same problem. brought it back for the 3rd time, and they stated there was a clamp the mechanic didn't tighten properly which caused it. great. soon as i drove home again the light came on again. i went back again for the 4th time and they redid the smoke test. they discover the fuel sending unit itself was leaking and was hoping it was just the gasket. they quoted $270 for the part and 4 hours of labor to change it out. they stated they would only charge me 3 hours because of the prior diagnosis. unfortunately, i had already paid for 2 hours of labor not 1 hour, but they wouldn't give me the credit as promised initially. in addition, i found out on the mercedes forums that the problem is very common, but it only takes 2 hours to do the job. i confronted them with this and charles denied it stating it would be a minimum 3 hour job. i went to schumacher mercedes dealership and bought the original part for $230 from their parts department and changed the fuel sending unit myself. i followed the instructions posted on the forums by other members and finished the job in an hour and a half easily. in addition, i also inquired about a burning rubber smell coming from the engine. they said it was the expansion plugs at the back of the engine that were leaking oil onto the exhaust - easy fix 1 hour job $200. i found out that the plugs were just plastic caps that costed $25 from the dealer and took 10 minutes to change out - simply pry off with a screwdriver and pop back in. this is what happened when i went there. wouldn't recommend going there even if their labor rate is $98 or whatever compared to the dealership's $139 - seem to be quoting more hours to do work and not crediting what they're supposed to on diagnosis time or taking credit for screw ups."
337,negative,"this place is awful! took my cadillac there on recommendation of aaa auto repair on az ave.they said that these guys would take care of my car. well they sure did! it sat there for 3 weeks supposedly waiting for 2 parts. once the parts were in, i had to wait for some guy to get there to reset the computers. the car has never run right. this was 2 months ago. the other evening at 10:30pm my son texts me that the car broke down on a freeway in las vegas. we have aaa tow the truck and find out the next day that the axle fell off! that cost me $385!! i know that they had to take the axle off to repair the transmission which is a piece of crap! i find out today for another auto repair that i could have gotten a new transmission for $3500!!!!n these guys are a rip off and i am filing a complaint with aaa for recommending this company as one that they ""always use""!  sounds like a kick back situation to me!!"
338,negative,"my experience was terrible!  dropped the car off finally on a saturday afternoon (needed to wait 3 days for a loaner).  i was having issues with my transmission and i am fast approaching 60k miles.  monday morning comes around and i am told the ""slipping and abrupt gear shifting is normal"".  this is per v.w. of america...... really?!  so ok, i pick up my van and plan to write a letter to v.w. to see if this is truly something they expect customers' to accept.  but wait!  it get's even better.  my van battery was completely drained while in for service.  it was jumped for me to drive home and discover the next morning (late for work and pissed as hell). i left a vm for jeff porter but he didn't even have the courtesy to call me himself.  he had an employee call and schedule someone to come to my home and switch the battery out for a new one.  not good customer service!  i am very disappointed.  never had an experience like this before and will not tolerate it.  thanks for making a bad situation worse."
339,negative,the truth is they deserve a zero star rating ! i spent 3400 hundred dollars at this store and was told i would be receiving all oem or name brand aftermarket parts . they charged me 800 bucks for a flowmaster exhaust kit  and as it turns out it's not even an authentic flowmaster muffler at all the parts used are all generic look alike parts . these people are scam artists apparently they don't expect anyone to put there car up on a hoist to check out there work after they complete it. i paid for a whole new exhaust system by flowmaster and all they did was cut out my mufflers and fill in the empty space of pipe with electrical emt pipe and welded it back together so it sounds loud .
340,negative,"i took my truck here because check engine light was on and it was sputtering at idle. i was told it was 54 lbs  of air in valve 7 so i would need a new engine. for $4100. whatever they charged me for their diagnosis was so worth the second opinion which turned out to be spark plugs and a bit of a tune up for a whopping $350. needless to say there will not be a return trip. i know this industry has a bad reputation and it is places like this that reinforce it. hopefully you are reading this before they get ya. good luck. 
side note:
i notice some type of response is done by whom ever but please save the keystrokes as there is nothing that you could say that justifies your blatant fraud. i will not be calling or visiting your service center nor do i care about whatever excuse you are trying to come up with to cover the obvious fraudulent practices done here. personally i hope karma balances your ""buisness"" practices."
341,negative,"ongoing nightmare - windshield cracked... insurance company uses safelite and based on my address i am to schedule with penn hills location. first appointment- replaced and next day whistling, second appointment - next day whistling, third appointment canceled one and half hours after scheduled, fourth appointment - replaced and whistling, fifth appointment i was asked to come to the shop. windshield replaced, did not whistle, but they damaged my car with a gouge out of the upper driver side. because touch up would not correct this i was advised to take to the dealer. very long story abbreviated the auto body owner came to give an estimate and found windshield was chipped and paint under the glass was scratched all the way around.. looking at $1200 to repaing. long negotiating resolving nothing. now 6 weeks later and i continue to wait to have an appointment to have my vehicle repaired. 
(p.s. during this time i was called by a quality control supervisor who actually admitted this was not faulty glass but technician error. never heard from him again)"
342,negative,"if i could give less than one star i would. my vehicle was towed here by my mother to get an estimate for repairs. one day later she receives a text telling her that her transmission is junked that she has a $585 bill. i'm the titled owner and never authorized anything. the only authorization provided is an illegible document signed with my mothers date of birth. my mother has never met the owner or been to his establishment so she has not signed any documents authorizing repairs. we called the police in hopes of a resolution and while the police were there he continued to text my mother condescending messages about how he was getting over on her. never come to this business. seriously never. my worst nightmare ever over a simple free, promised estimate.  please see this illegible proof of authorization and note he lack of signature obtained. i also have a video of him requesting to speak to the owner of the vehicle before bringing it in, which was not the case with me for whatever reason."
343,negative,"i would give this place zero stars if it was an option. took my vehicle here for transmission problems. now the owner talks a ""good talk"" but he is a piece of  work. had my transmission rebuilt over $3,000. it does not work properlyand never has since the rebuild. i  took back in with several complaints on the performance,  he said i drove it myself, its fine. it is not fine. i later took my car to get ac fixed somewhere else and he noticed how shitty my transmission repair was and how it wasnt even working. 
this place is so unprofessional, racist and rude. while i was in waiting room i can hear the owner screaming f$&k at the top of his lungs repeatedly.  he was talking so much smack about his ex wife and daughter it was awkward and uncomfortable.  he yells racist remarks about other customers and thats just the tip of the iceberg.  
this place completely ripped me off, biggest mistake ever coming here."
344,negative,"unethical company! charged my insurance company for ""fixing"" my windshield chip. u could still see the indent. dealt with multiple ""managers"" saying they couldn't help me. my windshield cracked and they will only give me a refund not actually fix my windshield. should have gone to a real company. not someone who just hires illegals. never will use again!"
345,negative,"went to rebuild my car accura with exchange engine and exchange transmission including left and right achsel, in  the beginning the owner was extremely helpful, till i realized that the helper mechanic had no clue and i found out that the left achsel which goes into the transmission - the seal has been built in improperly. - owner wanted to blame parts which for that i did not purchased - and seal is leaking a lot. after going back only answer was: nothing lasts forever. yes but after 9 month??   would not recommend to go there since owner has cheap helper which has no clue and is learning by doing! sorry! that is the truth.stay away!  also paid over the counter without receipt !!!!!!! ."
346,negative,"so my trucks transmission started slipping so i started googling rite away these guys came up.(should halve yelped them also )but despite prior warning i decided every experience could be different so i 'll give um a call. rite away the owner ""greg "" started selling me telling me ""bring it in i 'll have my guys check it out let you no how extensive and costly repairs would be"" i told him it's not running he said we will tow it in for free and give me an estimate,which at the time i was in a bind and i made a bad decision despite my better judgement out of necessity. this is also why you tell a shop before they start"" i want you to save all the parts"" then ""greg"" the old 1-2 about how it was the worst transmission he had ever seen damages were catastrophic and repair would be costly so he pulled a transmission off the shelf the had rebuilt previous put a shift kit in it all the bells and whistles and i'm getting a steal and since i'm in a bind if i put $1000 down he would fix my transmission and drive my truck and  let me make payments to them $100 a week till a balance of $908 was settled,so we agreed  shook hands and i waited to get my truck ,mind you when the tow truck showed up i started my truck and drove it into the street then the driver drove it onto the truck.when i got it back i didn't even get two blocks before it started misfiring and acting funny so i took it back 3 time s in a three week period all three times they assured me the transmission  was taken care of and it was a motor issue per their technician s request i had the carburetor rebuilt the distributor replaced and tdcc checked and confirmed also a fuel pump replaced by another shop  costing me around $400before i brought it back because they claimed coincidence s happen and i 'll agree they do but after $400 my truck still not running and a debt still expected to be paid i feel like my mind is leaning twords lack of integrity within this shop. anyway i ended up taking my truck back three times the first time it took them two days to tell me it was all good shortly after i figured out the transmission was going into lockup in 2nd gear the was a tranny pan bolt missing and the puddle of fluid dripping off my rear output shaft and the spedo still leaking so i took it back again they said ok we got all that stuff fixed so i leave again once again i get across the street and my truck stalls into the parking lot of the enterprise car  rental place literally rite across the street only this time it left me stranded with my two year old daughter on the side of bell rd at 5 o clock in the heat of course when i called no one picked up they were gone for the day so after that i told them i would not pay untill i figure out what s wrong with my truck there was never issue s before in the motor and after spending$ 400 on there guess s i don't feel obligated to pay untill it's fixed either way the owner ""greg ""calls me today from a private number today promiseing to fix my truck and such and i told him i don't have confidence in your shop and i'm not payying you the rest untill i can determine the actual cause of this issue. then he began yelling sayying you piece of shit your gonna screw me and hangs up like a little school girl lol  clearly getting outdated on business practice calling people in a threatening tone cussing  at them gets you no were especially if they owe you money which if he would have let me talk if it's after all not his fault i would have played him accordingly but as of now i have payed him $1200 of $1908 which i found out later it cost about 1400 to 1600 for this rebuild but they were cutting me a deal of course because u didn't have cash upfront they tack on $500 in home financing fee which could be fair if you actually did a good job but not the case here and  i had to take it back again were the techs now claim it's my old transmission lines are wore down my truck had 82000 original miles and it's an 84 i call bs and even if so i had to bring it back 3 time s before they figured it out and it's still not working.

 this place is a scam and the owner is a joke of a business man looking to take anyone that seem s easy to get over on. i would caution people to stay away from this place if they value honesty and good business practice the only thing good about this place is that the receptionist is polite and has good business skills probably the only reason their still open because the owner nor technicians have a clue how to do bussiness properly"
347,negative,"nothing ""grand"" about this dealer's service as service department is not the cleanest nor the most organized, furthermore people are not even professional either. they can never give you the correct time required to service the car ie. they say an hour will be needed but 5 hours later they say they have to keep the car overnight! and technicians are not even the most skilled as most things don't even get fixed and they will charge you for the labour!!!! we requested to have engineers flown in to inpects our cars, which they never granted. oftentimes they will find ways to not honour the warranties and make you pay for repairs. 

we've also been told too many lies here as they assume we are not knowledgable with cars. any repairs that would require too much work will be labeled normal, which included grinding noise in gears requiring rebuild of transmission. but they will manage to find small repairs with which they will charge you hefty amount to rip you off. 

do not service your car here. go in to fix one thing but you will come out with 10 more things to fix. you can bring the car in for steering fluid leak but you will have to come back 3 more times to have it comepletely fixed."
348,negative,"dont waste your money with these guys. they will play nice at first, that jd guy and patrick. they wont fix your car, unless you pay an extra $5,000. even then, theres still a possibility it wont be fix. i paid almost $3000 for my check engine to be removed, and still nothing. i went to bmw only, the check engine light is gone and i just paid $700. never again."
349,negative,"this store probably knows this review is coming...
took my jeep grand cherokee in bc it started a jerking motion as i accelerated or in a complete stop.
i walk in and tell him what i'm experiencing, he asks if any lights are on-like check engine?
yes, the check engine light has been on for many months. i took it to jeep and they looked it up on the computer and told me it's a leak somewhere.
the car is with them and same day i get a call to pick it up. they explain to me what it was and that it'll be 400. ok.
i go to pick it up and on the way home i feel the jerking still. the car isn't fixed at all. i have to get up early in the morning again to take it back and on my way over the check engine light turns back on. cool. what was the 400 for?
this time they need it over night bc they can't seem to figure out what's wrong with it. but they won't just say that. 50 later in lyft rides i get a call the following day claiming my car is fixed again and that this time they've driven it around to make sure. cool.
i get there and ask what was wrong with it and the front guy says under his breath, there was a ""tear in one of the hoses"". i don't make it out of the parking lot before i feel the jerking again. i stop and go back and tell him that it's still not fixed. the mechanic that had apparently been working on it takes it and aggressively drives it around the parking lot which i did not appreciate at all. he comes back and claims he doesn't feel anything. i say can you ride w me, he does, i say ""there! did you feel that?"" ""no, i didn't."" he goes on to pretend he doesn't know what i'm talking about. when in reality they were running diagnostics but it kept coming back clear so they didn't know where to look i guess?
i leave feeling like i'm crazy but he assures me if anything ""gets worse"" to come back. well, it did get worse-- the jerks were more noticeable so i take it back again. i don't know if more experienced mechanics were now working, or what, but someone seemed to figure out the problem. he calls me and tells me what it is and says the part is ordered. so when i get back to auto shop the front guy tells me there's going to be a cost associated with this repair. i tell him, i'm not paying for anything. i was actually going to ask for money back because of what i've gone through with you guys. he says he'll talk to his manager. i ask for a print out for what they're doing to my car and he say he will email it to me and never did.
i get to work and get a call from the manager who is making it seem like he's doing me this huge favor by covering that repair too. when in reality i deserve my money back-at least something back! these guys can manipulate the situation however they see fit so they're not taking full responsibility for incompetence. and you see this when the front guy muffled under his breath that it was a ""tear in a hose"", which was a complete fabrication.
lying to your customers, manipulating situations, and acting like covering the cost of the real issue was doing me such a favor--are these all apart of your high ethic standards?
will not be going back here again."
350,negative,"this may have been just my experience, so hopefully, yours will be better.  i made an appt 4 days ahead of time and was quoted a price of $189.  i arrived the day of and waited.  after 30-40 minutes, i was told that the price would now be $309.  they did not seem to know the needs of my transmission (odd given their name) when i booked the appointment. the price was more than the dealer (and the dealer is crazy expensive).  so i would advise going elsewhere."
351,negative,"pretty obvious attempt to rip us off and over charge us for work that didn't need to be done. staying here in mesa and traveling from florida we needed to have the rear axles seals replaced on our 2006 hurricane class a to safely move on the ca. 

from the moment we walked into the place it was a bad experience. i asked if we would be credited any of the labor time to do the initial inspection if we went ahead and approved the work and they guy with glasses who sits at the desk to the left to the left of the front door, instead of explaining to us that we would not be credit any labor time, he choose to get defensive and argue with me after i explained that other places sometimes credit inspection cost if you use them to do the work. i should have just left at this point..

we also told them on the phone before the appointment as well as when we arrived that we were pretty much homeless until we had the rv finished. therefore time was very important to us. not to mention it was 110 degrees and my wife and i we were on foot till it was done. it took these guys from 9am till about 3:30pm just tell us what was wrong and how much it would cost. i also had to call them 2x's during the day for updates and finally decided to go back in around 3pm to still have to sit there and wait 25 mins before they could finally even give me a quote. it was so ridiculous it was almost like they were making us wait on purpose. 

so here is where the rip off part comes in. i knew going in we need both axels seals replaced in the rear, that's why i was there. this can spray oil on the brakes and cause some contamination which i was also totally aware. however, to properly determine how much oil contamination you need to first remove the brakes calipers and pads to see if the fluid has soaked the pads. they did not remove the brakes, or calipers during the inspection and then proceeded to tell me i would need to replace both sets of brake pads and both rotors since they are soaked in axel fluid which was about $1000.00 of work. they told when when oil gets on the metal rotors it ruins them... i guess they didn't realized they were talking to a 25 year performances/ race level mechanic that deals with hydraulic brake systems pretty much everyday. rotors are metal and if they have continuation you can resurface them or simply clean them off with brake degreasers. you don't need to replace them and further you wouldn't know if you had to replace the pads unless you took the caliper off and pads out and inspected them, which again they did not and even told me they did not.

i also had a leak coming out of the back parking brake/transmission assembly that i asked them to give me a quote on. these guys told me the seal was not repairable and i would need to replace the entire parking brake assembly. they wanted $1750.00 for the part and 3 hours of labor.  

therefore i left, very frustrated and was actually embarrassed for these guys. i drove exactly one block down the street and turned in to their competition. the next day they gave me an appointment. they took the calipers off and inspected the brakes and said the pads were 100% fine. they even took me out to show me everything while it was apart. i asked them if they needed to replaced the rotors (just to see what they would say) and the guy looked at me and said, ""why would you do that?"" i then showed the leak in the parking brake transmission assembly and told them i was quoted $1750 for the part and 3 hours of labor. he laughed and said who told you that, that's a rear transmission seal. we replace them all the time. it's $65.00 for the seal and $400 to replace it. 

the quote and bill form the place down the road was $2,270.00 less than arizona rv llc. 

arizona rv wasted an entire day of our time, quoted me thousands more dollars in works that did not need to be done and the employee that sits at that right desk is rude, has very poor customer service skills and talks to you in a condescending manner.

and they charged me $55.00 to basically wast my time and sell me work that didn't need to be done. 

don't go here."
352,negative,"i went here after reading the reviews on december 8th and still don't have my car fixed. my car never had issues and then one day while i was at a stop light it wouldn't go. i pushed all the way down on the gas, it went 20mph, and then finally kicked into gear. this is the reason why i brought it in the first time. they said it was my air flow sensor and so they changed it. i went to pick up my car and the next day it had the same issue. i took it back for the second time and they said it was a communication error that they fixed. picked up my car, took it home, and the next morning it would not start. i had my car towed there for the third time for them to work on it. they said it was my battery and replaced that. then a few days later my car started having the original issue it was having where it wouldn't kick into gear. i took it back for a fourth time and they changed the computer for the transmission. i picked it up and that same day it broke down on las vegas blvd. i called them and they sent a tow to get it. they have had my car for the fifth time since friday night and are still not sure what is wrong with it. i am having it towed to nissan dealership so they can hopefully figure it out. 
they did refund me for the second the second repair they did but not the first.  i have paid over $900 for a car that is not working and now have to take it somewhere else. this has been going on for 18 days. there is no way i could ever recommend this place to anyone. 

update-

once my car got to the dealership they found my transmission and radiator fluid was mixed and i need both a new transmission and radiator. it also came up with other codes than what sun auto said i had. sun auto told me for a couple of days they were having their transmission guy looking at my car but if a transmission person did look at it they would have clearly seen the two fluids mixed up and would have know the problem. also i found out this is a common issue with pathfinders. while i appreciate they refunded me for the second repair i think they should have also done something about the first repair to make that right. the installed a mass flow sensor and battery. neither of these needed to be replaced to fix the true issue my car was having. that was about $900 spent that i could have used towards the new transmission and radiator i now have to get. we even told them we would pay for the labor if they took back the mass flow sensor but they would not agree to that. they also would not pay $65 it cost for me to have my car towed to the dealership. i felt this was the least they could do seeing as how it was the 5th time in 18 days i had to return my car there to be looked at and they still were not able to diagnose the issue. i would never bring my vehicle back there or refer anyone to this place."
353,negative,"came in today before they open 715am for oil change they said they are booked starting at 8am. but its not 8am yet hmmm and they have 2 techs onsite standing. but last major service that cost $$$$ they got me in no time they replaced my brake pads and rotor, timing belt, transmission flush worth over $1500 of service they got me in no appointment.  they even mentioned and said last time if you come in next time early we can service your car and i came back.   i have never seen a shop turn you down for oil change probably it will  only take them less than 30 mins. before they even get to next appointment.  i guess it matters when you have a bigger costly repair or service.  oh well i went to the dealer got it done in less than 30 min with a car wash."
354,negative,"i'd be giving a single star review for this shop, but they have perfected the nice guy act so well that i have to give credit where it's due. i almost fell for it, too, especially when they ""sympathized"" with my poor experience at purrfect auto.

i took my car in the day before thanksgiving because my 2015 chevy cruze with only 36k miles had a check engine light go on. they couldn't look at it then and there, so they asked me to bring it back after the holiday after ""confirming"" with gm that my car was out of warranty. they assured me that it would be cheaper to have it repaired by them rather than the dealership because i was no longer covered. i took my car back saturday morning and they were able to confirm that the turbocharger was underboosting and also discovered that my water pump was leaking and quoted me.... $2600?!
it sounded sketchy so i googled both parts which totaled to a cost of $650 (without warranty)... so i was expected to pay $1800 for labor on six hour job? i think the f**k not. so my next course of action was to call the dealership again to verify that  those parts were out of warranty and guess what? they weren't. at all.

nice try, guys. and i only wished they would have tried to ask me to pay a diagnostic fee so i could have really given them a piece of my mind. they didn't, but that won't stop me from letting yelpers know that this place is a trap! do your research and don't fall for jd and patrick's nice guy act!"
355,negative,"wow..   run run run run run run run run run away!!  the guy at the desk kept switching his story from ""i'm new, it's my first day at work, so i don't know what's going on.. "" to  ""your vehicle is likely going to have lots of problems when i get under your hood, so i'm just telling you up front"".   um.. i just brought my car in for an oil and transmission change, and without touching my vehicle, he somehow magically knew it would have a lot of (likely expensive) problems.   didn't give them a chance to jack with my vehicle.  i grabbed the keys and ran..  i ran so far away...  i just ran .. i ran all night and day..."
356,negative,"i want to share the bad experience i had with ctr refrigeration in calgary. i was in the market for a meat grinder and wanted something of higher quality than what's offered at the big box store. i went to ctr refrigeration because they are selling tre-spade grinders that are made in italy and are a specialty store. on my first visit to the store i was told that their tre-spade .75 hp meat grinder had metal gears and was of top quality. there was no display model so i took their word for it and purchased one that came new in the box. when i got home i opened up the box and took a look at the meat grinder and realized that it came with plastic parts and gears! the .75 tre-spade grinder was $745 and at that price i really would expect the gears to be metal. the next day i called to let them know that i wanted to return the grinder. i was told that i can exchange it without issue, but if i wanted to return it there may be a 25% restocking fee and i would have to talk to a supervisor about this. so back i went to talk to a supervisor and i was put in touch with their technician. he ensured me that the 1.3 hp tre-spade had metal gears and would last a long time. i took a night to think about it then went back to exchange the meat grinder. i wanted to see something in writing that the 1.3 hp meat grinder had metal gears. after about 20 minutes of them looking online, and trying to call around to find out, i asked them if i could just open the gear case of the display model to see if it had metal gears. they provided me with an allen key and gave me permission to open the machine.  i opened up the gear case and to my surprise gear oil spilled out, no one mentioned that the gear case was full of gear oil! the gears in the 1.3 hp were in fact metal, so i decided that i would exchange the .75 hp for the 1.3 hp. then i was told that the only 1.3 hp they can sell me was the display model that i just opened and the gear oil spilled out, but i just wanted to get out of there at this point, so i took the machine and asked them for some replacement oil. of course, they do not carry gear oil for the meat grinders they supply. i looked in the instruction manual and found that the gear oil that is required is industrial gear oil 680. the smallest amount of 680 gear oil that is safe for food processing that i could find comes in a 20 liter pale. i decided that i just didn't want this machine, and i was tired of surprises and disappointed that no one mentioned this. the next morning i called them to let them know my dilemma. the lady i spoke with called the technician and promptly called me back and told me that the ctr technician recommends putting transmission oil for an automatic car in the gear case! i explained to her that the oil recommended in the instruction manual called for 680 gear oil and that since the oil was being used in a meat grinder the oil has to be suitable for food processing (this is what i was told by the companies that sell the gear oil). she told me that the gear oil is inside the machine and does not come close to the meat. this just goes to show how little the staff know about the product they are selling. just an fyi, the gear oil goes in the case that contains the gears and there is a rubber seal that is about 1 mm thick that keeps the gear oil from entering the hopper which contains the meat. in my opinion, no one should be using transmission oil from a car that can potentially contaminate your meat if this rubber seal were to ever fail. 
i purchased the display model (already open box) 1.3 hp meat grinder on friday for about $1400. when they put the grinder in the box they forgot to include the bolt that fastens the hopper, so i couldn't even use it if i wanted to. i did not use the grinder at all and went back on monday to return it. they told me that they have never had a problem and using transmission oil from a car is fine. i mentioned the possibility of a slow leak since it is only 1 mm thick rubber seal that separates the oil from the meat and was told that keeping the machine properly maintained was the owner's responsibility. it was clear they just did not care. they decided to charge me a $95 return fee since they have to inspect the grinder now that it is being returned and will have to put some transmission oil in it.  it took them about 2 minutes to inspect the meat grinder when i returned it. the supervisor said that the $95/hour charge was a minimum charge for working on the machine. 
the bottom line is that their product knowledge of the meat grinders is terrible, there was no mention of a return charge, or restocking fee prior to purchasing the meat grinder, nor was there any mention of this on the bill of sale. i found the quality of customer service very unprofessional and very disappointing for a specialty shop. when you are spending $1400 on a meat grinder from a specialty store one would think they will have excellent product knowledge and customer service."
357,negative,"i recently had my car towed to  horne, because my car broke down in chandler, and my insurance will only tow to the closest dealership where the car broke down. they then replaced my engine, apparently there was a recall on my engine and they replaced it. however, when i picked it up it did not run right and within a couple of hours the check engine light came on. when i called them about this, they had my car towed back to the dealership. they then called me and told me i needed a new fuel pump and an o2 sensor...this would cost me approx. $1100.00.  i had not had any of these issues before it went there.  i do not understand why they gave my car back to me when it could have broken down at any time.  i reached out to their consumer affair dept., they were of no help to me. 
i was also told that they couldnt test my car far because it was on empty...this was a complete lie, i had just filled my car up before it broke down...the tank was full.  the only person that was helpful and seemed to care was jose from the service dept. he was always respectful and wanted to help as much as he could...unfortunately his incredibly rude boss jimmy powell probably had the final say.  i will never recommend or use this dealership again. jimmy powell was rude and even wanted to know...why i was in chandler when my car broke down....i mean come on, and i not allowed to go to another part of town without being questioned? anyway, if you want to be insulted, and made to feel like an idiot go ahead and go to this place...otherwise, shop around there are plenty of other places to go that will treat you like you deserve.
this has been a complete nightmare for me..."

359,negative,"been a customer since 2012. the quality of management has gone down significantly. a good business starts at the front of the door. lee and joe used to be welcoming, respectful and professional. the staff that trailed after that left much to be desired. 

2018, i brought my car in to get diagnosed and for an oil change. they told me for the repairs it would have to be dropped off on another day. i asked for a quote and gino said he would call me by the end of the day fri or early sat. i waited and waited. did not received any calls. i finally called tue and they said they could get my car in fri, a week later.

i dropped off my car at 7:30am fri and gino said my car would be ready towards the end of day. i called at 4:00pm to get an update, they asked for my name and number to call me back. 20min later they decide to call and tell me my car is ready for pick-up. kinda makes me wonder if they ever were going to call had i not called them?

on another occasion i brought in a older ford escort with a check engine light on. i needed to fix it so it could pass the smog to register it. mechanics spent 3 days trying to figure out what was wrong. the told me they would fix component by component until they figured out what was wrong. it would cost me $600 but not to worry because if the problem couldn't be fixed dmv would give a credit and let me register my vehicle that year. so basically, they had no clue how to fix my car but wanted me to spend that amount of money. they finally guessed it was some part that was obsolete. they called junk yards around the country to never locate the part. i wasn't charged anything but was told my car was basically junk. 

i ended up selling the car to a relative in california. he cleaned and gave maintenance to it, tightened some nuts and bolts and the check engine light went off! it passed smog and he was able to register it.

overall, it's an honest shop but i sometimes think the technicians don't have the experience. they are quick to replace a whole assembly than to fix a minor problem. they need improvement with the staff up front, more professionalism. three years ago i would of gave them 5 stars but they are a bit overpriced in their quotes. i kept coming because they're honest but lately service has been disappointing."
360,negative,took my truck in for a emissions canister part issue which is a $40 part at auto zone. this place told me i needed over $2500 worth of repairs plus brakes and rotors. explained i cannot afford all this unnecessary work. had them address the emissions canister issue. they call to tell me my truck is ready. when i arrive within 2 hours of the call my truck won't start. that was never the issue considering my truck started perfectly fine before it arrived at this place!! do not trust this place!! crocks!
361,negative,"methinks if you need your car repaired, look elsewhere. 

sometime in march the rear driver side of my car got hit. i received an estimate from the other person's insurance and was told to take my car to a body shop of my choice. i chose abc because they had a 5 star rating, and the shop is close to both my jobs. i called friday 4/8 and spoke to the owner who told me i could drop off my car any day the following week. i dropped my car off to be repaired on 4/12/16. i provided abc with an estimate from the insurance company of the person who hit me. not even an hour later, i get a call from the receptionist telling me that the owner does not want to deal with my car and to come pick it up. 

apparently abc did their own estimate and it was almost $1500 more than the original estimate i was given. i told them to just call the insurance company and they will pay whatever the difference is, but i was told no that the owner just doesn't want to deal with it. i appreciated the receptionist who was really honest and friendly, but i think this is just bad business. i even called the insurance company and they said they have never heard of a company flat out refusing to do business before. i can't obviously comment on the work they do, but i would be careful taking your car here."

i had an appointment brought my van in and three weeks later picked my van up and was told they never got to it and to come back after my weekend trip and they will get in it, really !!!!
searching for a mechanic help !!!"
365,negative,"oh where do i start?  believe all of the reviews (all are negative). we were in for 2 days over thanksgiving and purchased a jeep.  they would not even let us test drive the car until we agreed on a price?  who negotiates before test driving? scott lukovski (general manager) finally leveled with us and seemed straightforward.  wrong.  we did purchase the car, and as we are in the finance office, scott lukovski calls and tells the finance manager dawn bell to not give us a bank apr % discount.  why?  
dawn then had us sign a ""we owe document that shows a list of what the dealership owes the consumer if follow up is needed on the car.   diesel direct fiat of strongsville puts agreements in writing on the we owe document and sign it, they do not follow through.  we agreed to the following (all in writing):  
1. car to be detailed (it was literally full of dirt and an inch of dust).  
2. oil and transmission fluid to be flushed and replaced
3.  heated steering wheel electronic repair
3. new tires shipped 
the diesel direct fiat of strongsville did not do a transmission fluid flush.  when the service manager jim obenauer was looking the car over, he said he does not believe in them.  however scott said it will be done and on the work order.  we know this was not completed because we had to take the car into a different dealership for the steering wheel electronic repair (see #3 above) and was told the transmission fluid was never changed and filthy (the second dealership documented that on the work papers).  
we also were sold a car with recalls.  it cost us $140 to complete the recalls.  when we called scott and shared this information, he did not return our calls.  we had to retain an attorney, who requested reimbursement for the charges on the we owe (not including the recall).  scott called us finally, and said, you can't squeeze water from a rock.  really?  me as the consumer is asking a ""business"" to follow through on a documented signed agreement?  needless to say, we did get a check, but less than what was agreed.  
we request better tires and agreed to a $600 credit towards the tires of our choosing.  diesel direct fiat of strongsville put an upcharge on the tires purchased and charged us for shipping.  diesel direct fiat of strongsville provided the tire sales bill and handwrote a markup of $120 on top of the price they actually paid.  the shipping was not reimbursed either.  i can't stay enough about this dealership.  poor poor experience. dishonest, does not follow through.  they did say they respond to reviews, 
scott lukovski, we called and emailed you and your admin, requesting the status, check# and mail tracking # for the $100 for the shipping charges.  where is the reimbursement?"
366,negative,i took my corolla in for diagnosis of a check engine light.  i was told that my car needed a new evap carbon canister and a new gas cap - for an estimated $940.00.  i paid $150 for this diagnosis.  then i started to call around and realized that this diagnosis is about the highest price that anybody charges - even more than a toyota dealer.  i should have done my homework before taking my car in.  i took my car to another garage and they replaced the seal in the gas cap. diagnosis and repair was about $60.  so i will live and learn and never take my car back to this garage.
367,negative,"i was recently experiencing a bothersome issue with my motor, and was driving by two square, so i decided to drop by and have them look at my car. 

after a few minutes, a tech came out and noticed my pulley wobbling and said to stop driving before it snaps off and causes more serious $$$ issues. while the tech was looking he noticed a coolant leak, which was a separate issue. now, i appreciate them taking the time on friday to even come out and look at the car...read on.

so, of course i was not wanting to destroy my $100000 car so i left the car with them had them do the work on the pulley. while we were filling out the work order,  i also raised concerns on other issues if they could look into it for me:

1) i asked if i needed wheel bearings replacement? i had a rubbing vibration coming from the front wheels and felt it was bearings but i left that in their hands to diagnose. 

2) engine leaking oil around the valve covers. can they pin point it and see how much it would cost to fix

these extra concerns were going to be $124 for the diagnostic or inspection as they called it.

well, i got my car back. they fixed the pulley, $1000. all in all, with diagnostic, $1157 was the bill. here is their findings from diagnostic...

they noted that the passenger front tire was feathering, and it required a wheel alignment. that would fix the issue. they never quoted me on an alignment, but i'm guessing it would be around $200. 

they noted that the engine is running strong and no issues found otherwise. they recommended an engine conditioning/cleaning and then they could proceed with a dye test to see where its leaking, quoted me $400 just to start this diagnostic.

finally, the coolant leak required a new hose that runs from the water pump to the supercharger and back. it needed replacement asap and that would run another $400 to install...

now here is my beef...

i paid $124 for an inspection for the above. i did not authorize any of that work, as i wanted to go and get a second opinion. i headed over to a shop that i found on kijiji...and they found the following:

1) wheel noise: fully worn out left and right lower ball joints. fully worn right side upper ball joint. both wheel bearings needed repacking. the adviser brought me out to the car and showed me visually and then showed me the sound of a worn out ball joint, etc. did you know that if you have play in the ball joints, your tires will get premature wear...???

2) engine valve covers need new seals. car is booked in 2 weeks to replace

3) coolant leak was a damn clamp broken and not a friking hose that needed replacement.  cost 1 hr labour and part $80 they did a full pressure test not once but twice to confirm. all fixed.

now, i have to say, this competitor also did a full computer diagnostic and pulled me aside and showed me all the fault codes and what each code meant. all for $40 (1/2hr rate) and he found an issue with my transmission, which he caught so early, that if left alone, it would have destroyed my transmission.

i paid pennies for the above work and diagnostic compared to what two square charges. how did i get all the above diagnostic done by the competitor in a couple of hours, when two square had my car from fri-wed and i didn't get a pinch of info compared to what i got from the competitor??? there is no way you could not see the leak and notice it was the clamp or pull on the wheels and hear for tell tale signs that the ball joints and wheel bearings were kaput. unbelievable.

two square can obviously learn from this. the owner seemed very pompous too. after asking the same question to the advisor a couple of times, and not getting an answer, he came by and i asked him the following, 'what is the average cost to replace blah blah blah' and he quickly said arrogantly, 'first off, there is nothing average about your car...' my blood boiled when i heard that... am i the first e55 amg owner to come into your shop and ask how much something would cost to replace?? is it not my right to ask or should i just bend over...?? spare the lecture. you should appreciate the fact that you have paying customers in your shop, requiring your expertise/service.

anyways, i work hard for my money and have the privilege to enjoy some high end toys. think what you want of my review, but this is what i felt dealing with this company. i am not going back and have let my circle of friends know of my experience with two square. 

msg me if you want the 411 on the shop that is now taking care of my baby."
368,negative,"******run away******
classic bait and switch. reverse went out in my truck. drove it from prescott az to phoenix az. over the phone they said ""950.00"" plus hard parts (350.00) on high side. few days go by and i call them and they tell me ""your transmission was shot"". the truck would not even drive up onto the lift. (total bullshit). i said you're full of shit i drove it from 125 miles to you and it was fine, and you want me to believe the entire transmission never slipping in any gear except reverse and took a shit from where i parked it... to your lift? 45 feet? jeff is a new york con artist! 

i knew where this was going. they hand me back my transmission in pieces and hand me a bill for 950.00. so i authorized the work. when it was done and i was going to pick it up is where it gets even better..... 3,200.00 for a basic chevy 4l80e transmission. i could have bought a performance transmission for this price. 3 year 36k miles. (most people drive 36k miles in 2 years) so its a 2 year guarantee. 

so the front desk guy calls and gets me ""financing"". the people bring him over two checks. finance guy gives the guy up front a kick back check and pays the company. (i have been in sales and i know what i witnessed) guy behind the desk says to not say anything to the owner. 

after fiance charges and set up fees $3,525.14!!

i make decent money and i have paid off the loan in a month and a half. in that time it was 8.00 a day in interest in the 1st 2 weeks (130.25 interest in two weeks).
once i made the 2,000.00 payment 2 weeks later, it dropped down to 4.00 a day in interest. in that month it generated (140.86 in interest) 

i am not mad about the loan company, i know and understand they are high risk in their industry. what i am livid about is the way this company bait and switched me. 

while waiting for this truck to be fixed, i lost my other transmission in my other truck (4l60)
i called up copper state transmissions at 1121 s 21st ave phoenix az and i bought the rebuilt transmission and a new torque converter 1 year warranty 12,000 miles for 650.00 out the door. family owned and operated. veronica was amazingly helpful during this time.  

i was happy to know there are still honest shops out there, we just have to find them. 

if you are a single mom trying to raise a child and your car went down, some one on a fixed income or just a majority that is out there working your ass off to make a dime and your vehicle transmission goes out, stay away from these clowns. (1 star is too much for them)

also the financing is not the way. i make 86k per year. if you make less than 20.00 per hour do not use the financing. 

i am sure they will create a fake account and give themselves 5 stars to off set this. i am a hard working person, and i was raped by this company. in fact, my temp gauge is stuck since they did the work and there is a humming in the transmission already. i am not looking forward to dealing with them on the warranty issue. 

be blessed."
369,negative,"i had to give 1 star. i live close and needed warranty work on my sentra. they kept my car for 8 hours just to be jerks. pretty sure i was the first vehicle in that morning as there was not a car around when i arrived. my car need the most simple thing: an update to a recalled chip. unacceptable. embarrassing. i will let everyone i know this place is garbage. i do not appreciate being treated like trash and essentially being asked to dance like a monkey for my service jerk, as a joke. pretty sexist. he can suck it if he thinks i don't know what he was doing. i am kinda ashamed to own a nissan right now and i will trade it as soon as practicable so i never have to deal with a dirt nissan employee again. the doucher had the nerve to try to coerce me into leaving the car for transmission service with him after a day filled with bs and lies. they didn't even start to work on my car until 4 hours after it had been there and after i had my boyfriend call. apparently i am too stupid to know what's going on. how long would were they planning on keeping my car? until i agreed to let them take my money? extortion! my service douche tried to convince me no one else in town was even capable of properly filling the super special fluid. and it took 8 hours to update a little chip. might take a week to change the fluid. no thanks. embarrassing. does he think i am an idiot because i am a woman? i haven't been this mad at a dealership ""service"" department in a decade. i could have rented 2 cars for what these jerks cost us in ubers today. because they thought it was fun to jerk me around. i really appreciate it. do not take your car here. drive the extra miles to get actual service."

this place is really bad. moment i drove my car after an oil change the car broke down.

when told that it never happened in the car and its less than 2 year old they were not ready to accept that.

374,negative,"i forgot to mention they're highly recommended shipping company j and j auto transport. they were terrible. i was told that for around $400 i'd have the car in 5-6 days from phoenix to southern california. i could opt for expedited shipping and have my car in 1-2 days. i did so and i received my car 4 days later at 9 pm. i paid $700 extra dollars for that with no reimbursement. they had a truck break down. so i pay for that? that's not how it works.


so the grandmaster or ceo or high boss or whatever you want to call him gave me a call with no offer whatsoever of paying for the repairs and said you bought it you deal with it. that's what kind of people these
i wrote this review months ago. and nothing much has changed. i've dumped over $5000 into this car to get  the transmission, rear end, and electrical system running. the owner or rep of street side classics continues to try to contact me but i'm so upset with how i was taken i can't talk to him without exploding. if he wants to compensate me for all the repairs i've had to do, or at least 1/2 of the $5000 ill talk to him but other than that i'm afraid i'll loose it on him. so unless you want to cut a check for 2500 -which is way more than fair- do t call me and i'll keep with the reviews. street side. classics is a broker who does nothing to verify that the vehicles they're selling are of good proper working order. no compression tests, no transmission check, and no vehicle overview other than a quick glance as far as i can tell."

376,negative,"i have a hummer h3. i've been taking it to henderson chevrolet for 7 years. they've done all four brakes twice and done 100% fluid changes. i like to keep my vehicle's fluids a little more frequent than the recommendations because i do a lot of off-roading and it's my daily driver. when i first purchased the vehicle used i had a complete fluid change. i had them drop the transmission pan so that they can change the filter and clean out any debris and also do a complete 100% flush on the tranny. few years later the tranny pan leaked. no big deal. i was out of town and my mother-in-law take it to the dealer. there was no quote. the guy took the truck in and then called me with a $489 price. i freaked out a little. because to fix a tranny pan all you have to do is do a 50% fluid change. the 50% fluid change is $89.99. it comes with a new filter and a new gasket. after yelling at the cowardly moron thief piece of trash he lowered it to $289. my hummer has never been the same. these guys put slow drips on every single one of my fluids. every single plug on every single item was leaking. both differentials leaked they messed with my torsion bars which cause my vehicle to lean one direction. so now it's been a year since they did the huge rip off. so i called back to the cowardly dealership. yes the criminal dealership yes the corrupt dealership yes the rip-off dealership. they are cowards because they do this stuff where you can't see. and they think they're getting away with something. well my tranny pan is leaking again. these guys really suck at their jobs and their managers are the biggest morons on planet earth. very stupid creatures. i guess that's why did the managers of a car shop. anyway i called the manager and left messages twice. probably a stupid thing to do knowing what thieves and cowards they are. so i just want everybody know that these crooks wouldn't even call back to take care of the part that they admit to working on that leaks.
if you ever take your car here you are going to end up with more problems than you came in with. they will overcharge you. they will steal from you. they will not stand behind their work. stay far far away from this crooked illegitimate trash heap of a shop"

the tech originally came out to fix the washer and did not have the needed part available, meaning they were going to have to order the part. i was informed the part would be ordered the same day and it would take 3-5 business days to receive it, the part was ""delayed"" and ended up taking almost 2 weeks for them to come out and install the part. once the part was installed the tech then re-diagnosed my washing machine as needing a new transmission (which should have been diagnosed initially) in which they would need to scheduled a separate appointment for pick up. so an entire month, and days out of work i finally have my washing machine.

lastly every time i was told that i would have a phone call returned to me, it never happened.

horrible, service!!"
379,negative,mister transmission in newmarket is out of business. please note that a1 transmission is now at this location we welcome all costumers with a 10% discount as our appreciation for your business.
380,negative,this place is a complete ripoff. do not waste your time dealing with them. they are unethical and have shady business practices. they are not trust worthy. they do what you can to sell cars to people who work hard for there money.  a week after driving off with the car the check engine light came on and the refuse to look at it even with the 30 guarantee. after they get your money they are rude and unscrupulous. please take you business to a real dealership and stay away from them.
381,negative,"on my company vehicle, the check engine light came on. took it to autozone. they ran codes & said it was bad o2 sensor. they said because your vehicle is under warranty, take it to the dealer. 
made an appointment at peoria ford for 
7am. they tell me it will take all day and do i need a ride. 
i said ""but i have a 7am appointment and i've replaced o2 sensors on other fords before and took only 
5 - 10 minutes"".
they said there are many people ahead of you. i said ""but i have an appointment "".
they said those are just appointments to drop off the vehicle and technicians don't start until 8:00 & 8:30. 
appointments are nothing more than a scam!!!"
382,negative,"don't trust this dealer!
my husband took his chevy silverado to zimbrick chevrolet in sun prairie last week to have a check engine light looked at. they inspected the truck and presented him with a $1700 estimate. one item needing immediate attention, according to the mechanic, was the front brakes.  apparently, the pads had ""no life left in them"" and  the rotors were ""shot."" due to the long list and the expense, he elected to think on it and do what work he could himself.  he had replaced the brakes on our cars many times, so bought what he needed and got to work taking everything apart to replace the brakes.  imagine his surprise to discover existing pads with less than 50% wear and rotaries as smooth as glass. he put everything back together and returned the new brakes to the store. needless to say, we won't be going back to zimbrick chevrolet. we're angry and disappointed to be nearly cheated by this unscrupulous dealer.

lesson learned: take your vehicle to a mechanic you trust (preferably one who cares about having a life-long customer), get a second opinion, or do the work yourself whenever possible."
383,negative,"3 week update: started having issues again with the aftermarket cheap ignition coil that was installed after i was specifically told that only ford oem parts were used. i spent good money on that thing being fixed properly and still had to end up taking it to autozone to have my check engine light diagnosed and ended up doing the repairs myself this time when i find out it was a cheap aftermarket ignition coil that was installed by cholla. i barely made it home from work only three weeks after repairs had been done that cost $875. had to replace the ignition coil with a ford oem part that was misfiring and causing rough idle once again. practice what you preached to me about ""not using aftermarket parts on a ford"". overall i was very disappointed to find this out and will not be returning now, review goes from five stars to one star."
384,negative,"this review is long overdue, now that i just paid a reputable shop to install a reman tranny after i paid advanced transmission in phoenix for a rebuild.  i'll take some of the blame - i took the car to them based solely on the dealer telling me they thought they heard something going on with the gear changes, but they said a new tranny would be $5k+.  what i didn't know was i should have waited to see if the transmission actually started slipping or something, and then taken it in.  (mistake #1). so it was my fault, i took it to advanced and said i wasn't noticing a problem, just wanted to proactively fix whatever the dealer was hearing.  i was so naive, so i'll take responsibility for being dumb.

it took me awhile to figure out exactly how badly i had been scammed by greg and co.  

the problems started right away.  first, they failed to properly replace the axle, and i drove a long way and damaged something (seals, boots, whatever, i don't know all the damage, just remember the bill for new axle and stuff - at the dealer - and that was $1500 or something.)  

mistake #2 - i left az right after getting the car 'worked on' at advanced.  within 2 days of getting the car back, the transmission started going into neutral when accelerating from stopped - so, i was concerned, but not freaking out - i had that 'warranty.'  what a joke.  i took it to 3 different shops and they all said the same thing, they weren't getting a code so there was nothing for them to do.  to greg's credit he did say to bring it back in to him, but as i was living in another state, i never did bring the car back to him.  finally after the year was up (no more warranty) i had the car at another transmission shop and the owner there said from what he could see without taking the transmission out, it didn't appear that the transmission had been rebuilt.  he said 'basically, there are  items one would expect to be replaced during a rebuild' but he could see they had not been replaced.  the paperwork i got from greg listed no parts, which all the shops found odd (they all said ""he's supposed to list everything he replaced."")  so i asked this shop to call and speak to greg to find out what exactly he replaced.  greg admitted on the phone with this owner that when they do a rebuild, they only replace parts if they are broken, and they don't follow the protocol of replacing certain parts which one would expect when you go to all the trouble of dropping the tranny and doing a rebuild. now it was all starting to make sense to me.  my car didn't actually have anything 'broken' when i first took it to him, so they probably rebuilt - nothing!  

finally took it to a dealer, to see if they could diagnose the issue - and after spending a lot of time talking to the technician after his diagnostic efforts, we think the issue was a damaged seal, which is commonly caused by doing a flush. options: rebuild, reman, or let it die.  i felt like i was getting cheated out of some of the longevity of the vehicle - and i was responsible for leading her to her early death! 

fast forward to a week ago, i took the car to a shop with outstanding yelp reviews, and they put in a reman (all new parts) transmission for guess how much? $3k.  made my stomach turn to think i was charged that for a supposed rebuild 3-4 years ago, when i could have had a reman for the same price, or less considering inflation, etc. 

bottom line?  i don't think these guys replaced any parts, because i did not have a specific complaint when i first brought the car in.  i think based on the issues starting right away that they did a flush (they had to do something to feel good about charging me $3k, right?) and that likely damaged that seal. my poor car has been valiantly driving and driving ever since, with the troubles always when it's cold out or whenever i would drive over a speed bump or climbing, but i could just tell she wanted to keep going.  so this sounds weird, but i felt like the car was just a real trouper, and just wasn't ready to give up.  i finally listened and gave her a brand new reman transmission, and she's good - car runs great, loves being spiffed and polished, and without even holding a grudge, she's assured me she's going to give me at least another 3 years or 45k, but probably 3x that.  she asked one favor - alert others to save them from this shop.  so this is my public service announcement.  cheers."
385,negative,"3/4/16-went in for an oil change. after inspection, they strongly suggested several other repairs: right axle, timing belt, transmission service, & power steering service, almost $1000! i agreed, as i trusted their opinion to be honest. they were well aware i recently graduated & had been hired. i had only been working 11 days and they sure took advantage of that. 3/28/16- i went in to check the brakes. i was told i had only 25% pads left and they needed replacement. this was a horrible shock, since on my receipt from a mere three weeks prior recommended no services and especially when i don't commute very far. after all that other work, i thought i was good for a while. sadly, that was not the case. when i asked why wasn't i notified of the brakes wearing thin? chris, the mgr, only said, ""you didn't tell me to check the breaks."" what?! isn't this part of the service you do?? of course i agreed, another $325. they failed me, but there's more...5/22/16- my engine died. i towed it to a mechanic opened on sun. his diagnoses: oil filter was loose and the motor mount & top alternator bolts were loose. i had put oil a couple times, thinking it was needed because of the heat here. i would have never guessed it was leaking out because the filter was loose!? the next day, usa auto towed my car to their shop. after inspection, they accused the last mechanic to have changed the oil and filter & they were not liable, since there was no evidence of their work. this was a not true, i only paid for a diagnoses. basically, i feel this place did not service my car well and caused more damage, just so i would have to keep returning for repairs. disgusting!!!!! beware folks..."
386,negative,"this is the conversation between budget and my husband after his horrible eperience

jose, 

i appreciate the offer but i feel that your offer is inadequate. i have already been taking advantage of from the beginning and i do not appreciate being overcharged and misinformed with the initial contract regarding additional drivers. 
in addition, i do not believe that you guys do take well care of your vehicles allowing a truck to be rented that is far from driving par. not only was the wheel barring on the trailer worn down and useless but the replacement tire was rotted, worn down, and no manufacturer print date was on the tire.

not to mention the rear main seal on the transmission blew up when we were barely into our travel. and the mechanic that was sent out to replace it  put the drive train in upside down which caused the vehicle to vibrate immensely and sounded like a bolt was missing underneath. 

should i even mention the time i had to spend on the side of the road before any assistance became available? i waited 5 hours to wait for the trailer to be fixed in the middle of the afternoon in 90 degree heat with no ac. during the second breakdown i had to wait 3 hours before anyone came to assist, and the action that they wanted to take was just completely absurd. they did not come prepared, they wanted to lift the truck 12 ft in the air and drive 45 mins. do you have any common sense and idea of how much damage that would cost to the property in the truck? following the directions to pack the truck with the heaviest furniture in the back and lightest to the front, the weight ratio would not balance out 12 ft in the air. so because the mechanic was not prepared, my friend and i had to spend the night at a rest stop with no food.

and i don't want to sound like i am whining, but even the strap down ties for the trailer that was provided fell far from usage standards. it looks like they were frayed before and someone had previously used a lighter to melt the ties. 

enough about the issues with the truck and trailer, just think about how many lives could have been injured if the breakdowns weren't noticed as quick as they were. the trailer was swerving side to side, if it had been during a busier time, do you know how many cars could have been side swiped? and the smoking from the tailpipe as a result of the engine breakdown pretty much turned the surrounding area dark and clouded with smoke affecting visualization for vehicles behind us. if i had not caught it in time, the truck itself as well as the people inside could very well have caught on fire. 

jose, i understand that you are just trying to do you job as best to your abilities, but do you honestly believe that someone's life is only worth $180? my 12 hour trip was turned into almost a 3 day trip. i feel that time was stolen from me from spending time with my newborn, time that i will never be given back. as a member of the army, i have already lost a lot of quality family time.

if $180 compensation is the best you can do, then i am going to have to speak with someone who can better assist me. 

i appreciate your time jose, i will be waiting to hear from someone soon.

387,negative,"update: we proceeded to replace the engine after getting a second opinion... when the shop we hired to do the work drained the old engine they discovered about 2 1/2 gallons of oil. that is almost double what the truck calls for during an oil change. to add, we thought we were replacing the original engine with only 110,000 miles but come to find out the engine they removed is a salvaged engine! and was a quick install too; exhaust bolts, transmission, torque converter, motor mount bolts were all loose and the engine grounds and pcv tubes were not even hooked up. i definitely learned my lesson!!! never again will i purchase anything from lake wylie auto."
388,negative,"i bought my honda new in 2007 from honda west and have taken it there for all the maintenance (oil changes) etc. every time i had an oil change, they always say all the fluids get topped off. i had always trusted that they did.  well, be ware. the last time my oil was changed, my windshield wiper fluid was bone dry. i had noticed the place was unusually dead. i had mentioned to the guy that the windshield fluid was completely empty and he told me that is the first thing they do is top off the fluids. i also noticed that their prices had really gone up since my last oil change. anyway they were finished with the oil change in record time. when i was on my way home i tried the windshield wipers, and it was still bone dry. so my concern was if they didn't even fill my wiper fluid, then they obviously didn't check the radiator fluid, break fluid, power steering fluid, transmission fluid. last time i checked, they are considered fluids, are they not? so i went to auto parts store and got some wiper fluid which they should have taken care of for the price they charge. my radiator fluid is low, and so is the break fluid. well i called them back and spoke to the service manager and asked him what kind of an operation they run over there? he claims he had no idea the guy didn't check my fluids and told me to bring the car back, but i already lost confidence in them at this point. so the bottom line is they have a sign out front that lists all the things they do with the oil change, which i might add is not cheap, and all they did was change the oil. but did they really do that even? 
i will not be returning to honda west based on my own experience and what i've heard from other people. bu bye."
389,negative,"i took my 2008 r32 (which i bought from here new) in to this dealership last month for my 120,000 mile service. this includes a transmission flush on the dsg and usually is one of the pricier services on my car. i paid them $1000 for that service. shortly thereafter i started having issues with the dsg. it was throwing my car in to neutral, usually on long drives through the desert. i brought it back in. i paid them $159 to figure out what was wrong with it. i was quoted $2900 to replace the mechatronics unit.

then i contacted a couple of other shops about repair. just to see if maybe i could get it fixed cheaper, even if i was going to sell it shortly thereafter. 

found a great shop. they found the problem. 

when they did the dsg service (which i was charged $1000 for) their service department put 11 quarts of dsg fluid in my car. the car is only supposed to have 5 quarts in it. 

so on hot days and long drives the fluid expands, overheats, causes the temp sensor on the dsg to flip out and throw a false neutral. 

the new shop fixed my car for $300. no new parts. runs perfect now. 

either their shop is negligent or they are purposely trying to sabotage vehicles.

to review (tl:dr):

i paid $1000 for them to mess up my car. they offered to fix up that mistake for $2900.

i paid another shop $300 to fix their shop's mistake. 

don't go here."
390,negative,"wow! first off the good stuff... the tech, derek, was great! he greeted me very politely and professionally. i loved his customer service overall. my battery was going out so i had him check it and he confirmed i had a bad battery. i had bought the battery from a jiffy lube and wanted to check my warranty on it. so derek let me know he needed help from his manager on that. the manager (i didn't get his name) was doing a brake job. now, keep in mind i am the only other customer here. the manager tells derek he is too busy to help me and i would have to wait 45 min + if i wanted help. i wasn't too happy about that, but didn't know his situation, so i said that i could go to a different jiffy lube. no problem... however, now my car won't start because of my battery. the tech derek didn't know what to do to help so went and asked his manager who then shrugged his shoulders and went back to working on the car. now i'm pissed... i'm stuck in your driveway! you have batteries 10' away from me! i'll even just pay for it if it's because you don't want to deal with the warranty! the tech derek was kind enough to use his truck to jump start me and get me on my way to the other jiffy lube down the street off rancho and craig. thank you derek for going above and beyond and helping me, your service helped me tremendously! the manager, not so much... your customer service sucks!

note: the jl on rancho and craig is great! they are taking care of me quickly and it didn't seem to be a problem at all for them. and they are busy. hmmmm, i wonder why? maybe because they have great customer service? the manager even made sure to speak to me and ensure my experience with them was positive. it's those little things that make a huge difference. skip the jl off decatur and go up the street. i'll be sure and leave them a + review here shortly!"
391,negative,two planes today have broken down while trying to get from montana to phoenix. misses my connecting flight and had to wait an extra 3 hours then get on the next plane and check engine light came on so we sat in the plane another hour.
392,negative,"the staff is friendly although they have terrible communication, it took three people to get us checked in.  i brought my car to pep boys to have a check engine light diagnostic run.  i had already done the free prelim test and was told a master technician would need to do the full diagnostic to be able to tell more than it had something to do with my air pump.  i was told up front that the test would cost 45.00 and if i had the work done that would be rolled into the total.  when i received the call that my secondary air injector reaction *reactor* pump needed to be replaced i was quoted 469.13.  198.79 for the part, which i found online for 120.00; and 150.00 for labor at a total of 469.13... so math isn't a strong point either for the staff.  i can't afford this amount so i go pick up my car.  when i turned the car on the check engine light is no longer on, i go back inside and am told they reset the light.  no idea why since they didn't do the work to make it go off, but they swear it will turn back on eventually.  i get back in my car and make it a block away before realizing the driver side air bag light is on, it has never previously stayed on.  back at the shop again i am told that it was on when they took the car into the bay so it is just coincidence that it suddenly came on and if i like they will run a diagnostic that will cost 120.00.  not gonna happen,  i'm pretty sure they knocked something loose to cause the light to come on.  mostly though i can't figure out why pep boys would be doing a check engine diagnostic and think to try to sell me an oil change on my car (the sticker shows it was done last wednesday) but wouldn't suggest an additional diagnostic on the other light that shouldn't be on, the manager said no one mentioned it because i was there for a different light...  i will not be wasting my time or money here again, especially since i still have to get the air pump situation fixed and now apparently my air bag too."
393,negative,"i decided to try honda west's service since i had such bad service at findlay honda. trying honda west was a big mistake. 

i had an appointment on friday, july 7, at 8:30am. the airbag was to be replaced. i asked them to also look at my air conditioner because it worked great until it got up over 105 degrees, then it didn't blow very cold. i also asked that the breaks be checked because i heard squeaking. javier said my brake fluid and coolant needed to be flushed and refilled. i said ok. it was agreed that he would contact me with an estimate before any work was done. 

i was contacted a little after 11:00am. i was told how much the brake fluid flush and radiator flush would cost. i was also told that i needed to repair the air conditioner, get a new power steering pump, pay for a power steering flush, and replace the transmission fluid. i was told that the air conditioner was completely out of freon, that it was empty. this made me immediately suspicious of all of the claimed repairs. i wondered how my air conditioner could be working so well (except in very high temperatures) if there was zero freon in the car when i dropped it off. i didn't think that was possible and wanted to check it out.

 at that time, i said only replace the air bag and fix the brakes, since i was concerned about driving with bad brakes. i was told that they had already drained my brake fluid and the radiator fluid, so i had to pay for those things. rather than argue, i just said ok. i wasn't sure if they were lying about the freon or not, so i just said i would wait for the other things until i got another estimate. i didn't want to make an accusation when i didn't know enough about cars to know if that was possible. while driving home, i noticed my air conditioning no longer even blew cool air which made me think that someone there had drained all of the freon out of the car in an attempt to get me to pay a higher bill. i later saw on their own paper work that the mechanic stated he had evacuated the freon from my car.

when i got home i went on several websites where people can ask about car repairs. i told what happened and asked if it was possible for my air conditioning to work well except with temperatures over 105 degrees and the car be totally out of freon. i explained everything that happened. the people on the sites told me that it was impossible to have been working well if the car was out of freon. i was told never to go back there because they had emptied the freon from the car. i'm very disappointed about what occurred. i also noticed that comments attributed to me were placed on the paper work i was given at the end which i never said. i think my comments were altered to help justify the extra expenses.

it says, ""customer states brakes are making a grinding noise,"" which isn't what i said. i had said they squeak when i press on them. i think the statement was changed to justify needing to work on the rotors, too, instead of just changing out the brake pads. the other comment was, ""customer states a/c is blowing cold enough once the car has been running for a while,"" when my actual words were that it works great until the temperature is up over 105 degrees. i asked if that could mean the car needs more freon.

on tuesday, july 11, 2017 i went to a friend recommended repair shop to check on the air conditioner and the power steering pump. there was nothing wrong with my air conditioner. the mechanic stated that all of my freon had been removed from the car which is, of course, what i suspected and later read. he also checked the power steering pump. he stated there was nothing wrong with it. it wasn't leaking. the mechanic replaced the missing freon, and the car has run great since then.

i emailed the company on 7/9/2017 and 7/11/2017.  a bryan did call and leave a message which i repeatedly returned. i was always told he was unavailable. on friday, i was told he wouldn't return until monday. none of my calls were ever returned."
394,negative,"i bought my car here 3 years ago, i definitely got screwed over with my loan & will end up paying twice as much as the car is worth. 

the service department is a joke, i have dealt with greg, the ""service manager"", & i have had to take my car back 4 times within the last 6 months because they did not fix what they said they did. & these are things covered under a warranty that i have paid for. every time the car has been brought in greg says what was fixed in addition to other things that needed to be replaced under warranty & then says a list of other things that needs to be fixed (not under warranty) ranging from $500-$1100, i'm assuming that if you don't agree to allow them to fix these other things that they just don't fix anything at all. 

on one occasion when my transmission pan was supposed to be fixed, i went to get my tires rotated at another shop & the guy working on my car said it was still leaking, took it back to greg & it was supposedly fixed. took my car in for a oil change at a different shop & they said my transmission pan was still leaking!! 

just took my car back for another oil change & they said the oil pan was leaking, took it in to greg & he says they replaced it, guess what?!!! took it back to the shop to ask them if it looked liked it was fixed & nope!! looks the same!! 

update:
greg texted me to let me know that he seen my review & that they did not replace it they resealed it. what's the point of paying for an extended warranty when all they do is reseal instead of replace??!! let's just put a band aid on it until the warranty is no good & now you have to pay out of pocket for it!! livid! 

i do not recommend this dealership or service department."
395,negative,"this place is horrible. i took my car into get a routine oil change, and the sound system inspected. they were able to do the oil change, and obviously try to upsell me on everything they felt needed repaired. they even told me that i needed the transmission fluid flushed, even though i had it done three months prior at another dealership. as for the sound system inspection, they had no idea why the stereo wasn't working. the representative told me that they would only be able to figure out the issue if i pay them another $200.... mind you i was already around $300 and with no answers. i ended up cutting my losses, and taking my car to a local car audio repair place. the representative told me that this repair is extremely common on my make and model of vehicle, honda accord. they were able to make the repair in a few hours, and it still cost less than what the dealership wanted in order to ""investigate the issue"""
396,negative,i recently called asking g for a quote regarding to get my transmission. over the phone they quoted me 169.00 for everything including filter. called again to verify the cost friday morning. it was the same price. i took my truck in friday afternoon and they told me over 440.00. i was astound was told phone quotes are different the the actual looking at the truck. i didn't get my transmission drained.
397,negative,"update: another month running with the transmission that chapman tried to tell me needed a major repair.  i recommend to anyone using chapman for service, that if they tell you you need a costly repair, don't believe them.  take it to another shop for a second opinion."
398,negative,"unfortunately,  this review is for the location on 36th street and thomas but they aren't listed.  took my car for a transmission fluid exchange,  they ignored the sticker on the hood and used the wrong transmission fluid and now i need a new transmission.  going through the claim process and a week and a half later,  they are still dragging their feet. i have been without a vehicle and in the 9 days,  they have only called me once and that was to introduce himself.   when the dealership tries to find out what is going on and the status,  they get very defensive.  i will never take my car back to firestone."
399,negative,"i had been here a few times recently to get oil changes in both of my cars. so when my check engine light came on in one, i took it to them. from the earlier visit, they told me i needed new drive belts. so when i went in i said go ahead and change the drive belts and find out whats up with the check engine light. they said no problem, and sent me on my way. cool. for those of you who dont know, theyre only open mon-fri, 8am to 6 pm. so 5:30ish rolled around and i still hadnt heard from them, so i called. they said they did an inspection and i need new drive belts.... uh... yeah.. i know. they said they also found what was wrong with the check engine light. and instead of calling me earlier to tell me and ask to get started working, they didnt call and sat around with my car all day. whatever, so i asked how long itd take to do the work. he told me hed have it ready by 6pm friday. cool, do it. so friday rolls around, and both my bf and i work, and couldn't get there till 5:30 ish. since they still hadnt called me, i called at around 4, no answer. i waited a few minutes and called back, no answer. so i left a voicemail and called about 15 times inbetween then and 5:30 when i got there. no answer. i got there and the shop was closed. really?! you close 2 hours early before the weekend, when you're not open and i cant get my car back until monday, and you cant even call me? it gets better. i went in monday, and they said they had my wrong number written down and they tried to call that number. drew the mechanic, said he got my voicemail, got my right number, and had been in the shop all day saturday. why the hell couldnt you call me saturday?! you guys had so many opportunities to correct the situation, and didnt. you were rude and literallu argued with me instead of just saying sorry, ya messed up. i am so dissapointed and i will never go back. 
i discourage all of you from going here."

401,negative,"worst service ever! scam!

i would never recommend using san tan ford's service department ever!

i have had 2 terrible experiences here which goes to show you fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. 

my first experience was having my suv alignment done here. i dropped it off for the day and came back to pick it up and paid and was told they made minor adjustments. i pulled out and onto the 202 freeway and the truck went crazy out of control and jerking the steering. 

i pulled over fast as this was pretty scary and looked under the truck and found they forgot to put the nuts back onto my tie rods and it's amazing i didn't crash. 

i went back and they at first asked if i did anything to he truck in the 10-15 minutes since i left. i said of course not.... they said they didn't know how it could have happened to be heir fault since a second mechanic checks work before it leaves. 

irregardless they screwed the nuts on and i went home.

the worst trip was when my transmission wasn't going into overdrive with only 8,000 miles on it from another shop. san tan ford told me it was the transmission again after charging me around $450 to diagnose the problem. 

they quoted to replace it and i told them i would see the other shop that put it in since it had a warranty. i brought it to the other shop and they said the transmission was testing fine and that it was electrical. 

i called san tan ford and they said the transmission shop was scamming me and didn't want to do the warranty. i got really mad at the transmission shop and argued on the phone after the so called ""experts assured"" told me i went to a bad shop. 

i brought it to another diesel shop where they said it was an electrical problem stemming from inconsistent voltage produced by the alternator and that ford had a service bulletin about this. they charged me $250 total to replace the alternator and the truck was perfect!

i told san tan ford afterwards and asked to see the general manager after all the trouble and they had me wait for 45 minutes in the sales area when the service manager came out and gave me a $220 gift card to service to make up for it. 

$220 to make up for harding me $450 to misdiagnose and blame someone for a simple problem wrongfully. this and nearly 2 weeks without my vehicle as this all transpired. they didn't even give back my total service fee from this fiasco!

the moral of this story is that san tan ford service department is a scam. don't use them no matter what you do!"

i need help making things right here:

for an insurance company that seems to truly value assisting their policy holders, progressive, i have to say, has been the most disappointing experience i have ever had. i was in an accident back on october 12, 2016 due to a transmission failure. the repairs for my car were initially quoted with a completion date within 2 weeks. i was provided a rental car and everything seemed to be going smoothly.

then, seemingly every three days, the completion date was pushed back due to a part that had been placed on backorder. eventually, after a month of waiting, the repair extended beyond the time my plan covered my rental car, so i was forced to return it with no other transportation options. 

establishing any sort of contact with my claims representative was difficult, and i was often left in the dark in regards to my questions and requests for more information.

i have been without a car for over three months now. over three months...for a 2-week repair! progressive has not provided anything by way of extending coverage, and has in fact, doubled the amount i am paying them for my monthly insurance payment, despite having no car to drive. 

after doing legwork on my own, i was able to procure the part that had been supposedly causing this delay...at the beach ford dealership right down the street. progressive insisted that installing this part was the only thing left to be done.

i coordinated the transfer of my car from the progressive shop to the beach ford service center, where the part would be installed. ford had since informed me that, not only did progressive fail to complete the repairs they assured me had been resolved, they also failed to perform the appropriate diagnostics on the vehicle. i asked them to give me the details regarding the transmission failure that caused the accident multiple times. they still have not looked into this...the cause of the crash.

beach ford is currently trying to order the additional parts to complete the neglected repairs. progressive called to collect their $250 deductible last week, insisting that the payment had to be made. i have spent well beyond the cost of my deductible and cumulative policy in payments for transportation while my car has been sitting in their shop. i couldn't cancel until the repair was complete, but it is clear now that progressive had no intention of completing the repair. instead, they intended to hold the car indefinitely while raising my rates. that, everyone, is theft.

clearly, the service i have been paying for was never provided. i have been a policy holder for two years. this is first time i have needed to use my plan. i am so disappointed and frankly surprised that this is even permitted. if you are considering this company for auto insurance, look elsewhere and save yourself the time, money, and headache. 

i still don't have my car. beach ford has found other repairs that progressive failed to complete."
403,negative,"do not go here! this is by far the worst car renting experience i have ever had! we got a junker that looked like it was straight from a junkyard with 215000 miles on it. the body was beat to hell and the inside was torn and dirty. when we were driving the check engine light came on so we called to exchange the vehicle. we drove back to phoenix and when we arrived the little man behind the counter started screaming at my mother ""you dont know what the fuck your talking about, there is nothing wrong with this car"" he took the keys and charged us more for only renting 3 days how is that legal i dont know? the owner of this place is an angry little crook and only stays in business by taking advantage of families on vacation."
404,negative,"if i could give negative stars i would. my husband scheduled an appointment for me to take his 2009 gmc sierra 2500 diesel truck to ""scott mccorkle's liberty gmc"". the check engine light was on and another warning would come on and off saying ""reduced engine power"". my husband knew it was something to do with the turbo, but it could be a number of things so he wanted it professionally diagnosed before deciding how to proceed. when i checked in they said it'd be at least 4 hours..... 45 minutes later they said i needed a new turbo, it would cost over $5,000. my husband wanted to talk to the mechanic to ask a couple questions before proceeding with such an expensive repair, the staff agreed so i didn't have to be the middle man. the conversation ended badly, the mechanic wasn't able to explain how he reached the conclusion that the turbo needed replaced besides saying ""it's not spinning"". there is a computer on the dash that showed the truck was getting some boost from the turbo but not as much as it should be, which proves it was spinning..... we went to ""denver diesel"" in denver, nc for a second opinion. it was the turbo sensor, $432.58 to fix!!!!! how can a gmc dealership make a $4,500++ mistake?!?! and if we would've had them replace the turbo it would still be giving the reduced engine power error code because the same bad sensor would still be there.  i will say that during the one hour i spent at gmc the staff was nice to me, and they didn't end up charging the $100-ish for diagnosis, but no amount of niceness can compensate for trying to overcharge me thousands of dollars. i don't know if it was intentional or not, either way it's still horrible. how many people have been screwed over by them because they don't take the time to educate themselves about their vehicles or get second opinions?"
405,negative,"i had my car repaired here for the sole reason that my insurance company sent me there. i left my car for about five days. after i picked my car up, i noticed that a brand new helmet i purchased for nephew was gone. the helmet had been in my trunk since december, as it was a christmas gift. i have called the tempe caliber collision twice with very little, if any, concern for the missing helmet! i am very disappointed that an employee of caliber collision would steal a kids gift from a customers vehicle. i'm even more disappointed for calibers lack of interest in an employee of theirs stealing from a customer! my advice to anyone leaving their vehicle with the tempe caliber collision team is to clear their vehicle of any children's gifts or other items of any value! if an employee would steal a kids helmet, i can only imagine what would happen to any item of value!"
406,negative,we heard good things about this repair shop from years ago. not so much these days. my elderly parents needed an emmissions repair. once we got the vehicle in there we ended up with 3 visits where they kept finding things which out of reliability we had done. went back to emmissions and it failed 2x. this last time they fixed the muffler pipe which should have been done previously and tried to charge us again. then we got there to pick it up and the front grill was gone. they said it fell off while they were test driving the vehicle and was not responsible. hmmmmmm it cost us over 1k total and who knows if it will pass emmissions. i also found out from the volvo repair shop i was taking to previously that they repaired items that were fixed less than 6months ago. never recommend!!!
407,negative,"if i could give zero stars i would.  complete rip off.  they use scare tactics to make you think your teeth are going to fall out of your head so that they can soak you for everything that the hygienist can make on commission driven sales.  i never had a problem with my teeth and was soaked for $1400 plus whatever insurance pays for a cleaning.  they have a staff of snot nosed kids in cheap suits whose function is to explain how much you are getting fleeced after the scare from the dentist, who should actually work on his own personal hygiene.  i never went back and when i found a reputable dentist he agreed that i had been overcharged. i was given so much novocain that i had to keep sitting up because i was so dizzy and felt sick. i was actually a patient at another gentle dental and i moved to scottsdale.  they don't have electronics transmission of records they have to mail them and that was the first fiasco.  cheesy unkept office behind mcdonald's in a shopping center full of transients and weirdos, half of whom apparently work there."
408,negative,"i really wanted to give this place a try, a second chance, and even a third try. on all occasions i was disappointed with the customer service. on my first visit i dropped a car off for brakes and and oil change. i was given an estimation of the time it would take and the promise that i would be notified when the work was done. not only was i not notified, but upon my calling to inquire why we still had not recieved a call i was greeted not with empathy for my time wasted, but excuses and blame being placed on me. i didn't need much. i just would have appreciated someone to acknowledge that my time was wasted and then we could have moved on. when i came to pick up the vehicle i immediately notice that every time i would brake the car would shutter (most likely due to the rotors getting slightly off during the machining process). once again no big deal i would return to have the rotors re machined and the pads put back on. so when i came back into the store to request that that be done, i was greeted with excuses and told that it may be my rear differential. at this point i was annoyed because not only was i not met with empathy again, but now i am being forced to argue just to have the promised work done? it looks bad when you give your customer a finished product back and it isn't working properly right off the bat. brooke i believe is the employee i spoke with, and her ability to explain technical things to me was lacking. also not a huge deal. i'm sure she knows what she is talking about, she could just use a little work on explaining issues and potential risks. 

upon returning to the same location for an transmission flush, i was told that it would be around 3 hours before the car would be finished. past that three hour mark, i was given a call saying that there were potential risks included a broken transmission. this once again if explained correctly would have been a better exporence. i ended up declining the service due to the previous expirence i had here. i think there are just a few key things in these interactions that would have improved my expirence and made me want to return"
409,negative,"i'm with caesar, avoid this place like the plague.  jack isn't a nice guy, he isn't dependable and he will lie straight to your face.

brought my car in because the check engine light was on and we had been told we needed to replace the timing belt.  they were the most resonably priced (what a joke that phrase turned out to be) and could have it back to us a few days.

now the nightmare began. 

after over $1,400 dollars in repairs, i picked up my car and drove home.  the following morning, same problems with the car - misfiring and the check engine light was back on.  back to the shop we go.  now we have new problems!  $500 later, more repairs.  the next day, car was misfiring and you guessed it, check engine light back on.

back to the shop we go!  more work (that they didn't charge us for, but i don't believe was really done) and they promise the car is better than new.  

riiiiight....

10 miles down the road, car is misfiring again and the check engine light is back on.  and where did we go the next morning?  back to the shop - but this time jack, the owner, was there.  and what an unplesant, rude, disrespectful man he is.  i cannot believe he owns a business.  he flat out lied to my face when he told me that ""chuck"" had drained my gas tank and found it full of gunk.  funny, i had the same amount of gas when i dropped it off and no one had mentioned that had been done.

2 days later, now we are being told the computer is fried - another $2k worth of work.  what?!?  oh, and today jack emptied the tank.  interesting, as jack told me it had been done 2 days before.  and when he did?  he ""forgot"" to fill it back up, leaving me with fumes to make it to the gas station.

the car is now at the dealership, which is where i should have taken it to begin with.  not trust some shady, rude, liar.  

i wouldn't take a barbie car to this ""repair"" shop.  hopefully they won't be in business much longer and won't be ripping off other people."
410,negative,"let me start by just saying i have never had someone try to push so many services i do not need.  i recently had my oil changed here, after which i was told i needed a transmission fluid change because the transmission fluid was ""black"", a fuel line flush, and some other service.  after checking all of my receipts for my car, it had only been 20,000 miles since my last transmission fluid change (it is only needed maybe every 100,000).  i can honestly say i will never use this company again."
411,negative,"dear chapman dodge,
i appreciate that you are unhappy about my negative review.  however, knowing that i don't want to mess with another breakdown, possibly in the middle of nowhere, i have researched this and talked to other dodge dealers and other people and forums with my same vehicle.  all, including the dodge dealers, have told me that yes, 2qts low is low enough for the computer to throw the code that it did.  it was under load, going up a steep incline, which most likely made the fluid level appear lower than it was.  and no, i wouldn't want you to clear codes, add transmission fluid, and tell me all is good... what i would expect, if you believe there may still be a problem is, add the fluid, clear the code, explain it to me, and tell me that adding fluid ""might"" solve the problem, but i ""might"" still have a transmission breakdown later on.  provide me with information and let me make the decision.  if your guys had even recognized that the fluid was low and discussed option with me, i would be forgiving.  but every other shop or tech that ive talked to about this has said the same thing... that yes, 2qts low can cause the error.  your guys went straight for the kill and a high dollar repair and let me leave the shop still with low fluid.  also to be clear, the other shop did not clear the code... they did not see the code that you say your techs say they got.  so it makes me wonder if you actually got the code you say you had.  i think andrew saw a female with a truck she just bought out of state and figured he could scare her and get some extra money out of her by telling her she needed major work done on her vehicle.  i know some things about cars and i know a scam when someone's trying to pull one, so andrew, and chapman, lost on this one.  i only hope i can help prevent others from falling for your scams too.  i can post monthly updates here if you'd like, letting you know that, yup, another month has gone by with strenuous towing and no more transmission problems... and if the same problem comes up, i will be fair and post that here as well.  what burns me is that you didnt even know the trans fluid was low, yet feel so qualified to tell me i need a major repair.  maybe your people should call the other dealers and ask if 2qts low could cause the error... and read your own technical information.  first 2 reasons for the error on the information that andrew sent me were ""low transmission fluid"" and ""dirty transmission fluid"".  apparently no one at chapman even checked the fluid.  stayed tuned for monthly updates!"

i have a 2004 honda accord with 70k miles. (this was my 3rd visit) this had been a great car that i bought from my mom that had low mileage. i questioned the worker when she recommended high mileage oil. i just thought high mileage would be 100k+. she reassured me that it was mileage close to 70k.  well 1 month later i have spent over $400 fixing the problem of gunked up oil that has clogged up. 
coming home from the beach the check engine light came on and then started to jerk as if no gas was getting through the line. we were on the freeway and it was a terrible, sickening feeling to not know if we would make it home. (dark by the time) 
we did the diagnostic test done by our mechanic 
and a solenoid part had to be replaced. 
the gunky oil had to be changed 3 times that day and again 3 days later. 
now...5 days later check engine back on. what the heck!!! i'm pissed and i'll never be back, due to mis informed workers that are persistent on making a sale that is way over price. you will pay for convenience... but i won't do it again. it's not worth messing up your vehicle!"
413,negative,"service department is horrible, not only they don't know about cars but they get an attitude and talk about you the moment you step away, they sold me a lemon car and instead of giving me a new one, they rebuilt the transmission 3 times. i was just told by one of their sells people about how they gave another customer a new car to avoid bad reviews. really?"

 i asked who to complain to and was given toyota corp canada phone number, i live in usa. then i found the problem to be a disconnected hose, i plugged it back in, reset, and haven't had the light return. i will not be returning to this dealer for any reason in the future and would strongly advise anyone else from visiting them."

here were my problems.

2004 vw jetta transmission was rebuilt 2/2013 and it never worked right. they refuse to fix it under warranty. the last week of january i had dcs auto take out the transmission of my 2004 jetta to be rebuilt. dcs gave it to r.t.s. for a rebuild. when it was ready dcs picked it up from r.t.s. and re-installed it. i took possession of the car on 2/6/2013. the very next day i took it back to dcs because it was not shifting correctly. dcs took it to r.t.s. and they topped off the fluid and said to drive it more to see if it works it's self out. it never did. i took it back several times in the past 7 months trying to get it fixed. this last time i took it to r.t.s. my self on 8/30/2013 i took the owner shane for a ride to show him the issues. i left it over night on 9/2/2013 for them to check it out again. this time they say it will cost an additional $1200 to fix. i have a 2 year/24k mile warranty and they will not fix it under the warranty. it has only been 7 months and 9k miles since it was to be done. i took possession on 2/6/2013 and was told that the transmission was rebuilt. i never had a problem free transmission since day one."
417,negative,"a few weeks ago i left a great review as a first timer here, but i need to take it back.  i bought a 2015 ram out of state and brought it in to chapman for some minor ""cleanup"" service items.  that was a good experience.  a couple weeks ago, my truck broke down on the road and i had it towed to chapman.  i was told it was a transmission problem and they needed to open up the trans just to determine what the problem was and that alone would cost $1200.00.  then depending on what they find more costs would be added on, up to potentially $4000.00.  they actually told me that a truck like mine isnt worth keeping and i should trade it in with them for a better one (mine is a 2015 so not old). i decided to take it to another shop.  after they ran diagnostics and test drives for a day this other shop could find nothing wrong with my truck, except that it was 2 quarts low on transmission fluid.  they did tell me that they love my truck and the way it runs and they want to buy it from me... quite a different attitude from chapman. so it seems that chapman let me leave their lot being low on trans fluid, which tells me they probably didn't even check it.  i'm pretty sure they were supposed to do a transmission service on it the first time i was in, so now i'm wondering if they even did that.  if they did then they are the ones who left it 2qts low and caused the error in the first place.  so anyway, i let my service writer know what the other shop told me and he was adamant that their diagnosis was correct.  so he emailed me the tech sheet on the error they received that made them think it was going be this big repair.  guess what the first possible cause was... yup... low transmission fluid.  i'm glad i had the presence of mind to get a second opinion rather than trust chapman.  i spent $300 with the other shop instead of a possible $4000.00 with chapman.  i waited until i towed my 44ft 15000lb trailer over the same mountain where it broke down last time, just to make sure it wasn't going to keep happening... i did that today, over the mountain and back, and the truck handled it with flying colors.  needless to say i wont be going back to chapman.  and since this happened to me, i've had other friends tell me similar experiences that they had.  i'm not really sure if they are trying to take people's money for no reason or if their techs really don't know what they are doing, but in any case, i would recommend staying clear of them for service... but if you do use them and they tell you that you have a problem that will cost a lot of money to fix, at least go get a second opinion."
418,negative,"i needed simple oil change, rotate tires, and check slow leak in left rear tire. brad was my service adviser.  i should say here that my wife and i love our 2014 crv, it has been a great car.  we bought our crv in another state, so this was first visit to this dealer.
the service waiting area was nice, complete with coffee and donuts.
brad came out said tire had nail in a place that could not be fixed. so we of course told him to replace it. 
the very next day while driving, the tire pressure light came on, so pulled over to check tires . to my amazement the front right wheel was missing a lugnut! really! they left off something that keeps the tire on! also there was a stem cap missing on rt rear tire.
called to talk to brad, right then and there. could not get him on the phone, so left message for service manager. as i was driving home got call back from manager who seemed very concerned, said he would send someone to house to replace items, and would for sure be there by 0900 next day. well, no one showed at 9 or 10 or 11 or 12. called at 1230  finally got a hold of brad, told him story. he said someone would be there and they did show about 3:30. replaced the items, checked the other wheels. nice kid.

419,negative,"certified tire used to be the best there is-- trustworthy, competent and reasonably priced-- and so i have been a faithful client of theirs since about 1987. but in the last 2 or 3 years their standards have dropped-- frank just doesn't seem to care any more. probably 4 out of 5 times i have had to go back to the shop after service, in order to get something fixed that wasn't done right. and in the last couple of years there have been a couple of major things that they have slipped up on, and he just refuses to take any responsibility for them. for example, he always kept track of routine service intervals for me and i could rely on him to let me know when service was needed. recently my transmission began making noise, and on checking i realized the fluid had not been changed for about 170,000 km. his only response? ""good thing it wasn't a ford-- it wouldn't have survived."" in another incident, i had asked them to replace some dash lights that had burned out. despite three tries the lights they installed are still mismatched. but more serious, following the last time they worked on it, a custom disconnect switch i had had them install a couple of years before was no longer working. though they are the only people who had ever touched the car, they refused to acknowledge that either the original connection was poorly done, so came apart when disturbed, or the guy replacing the lights had damaged it. all frank was willing to do was unplug a couple of connectors under the hood to do what i had installed the disconnect for. when i finally took the car to another shop to have them look at it, i found that in doing the work-around, they had also torn some rubber protective skirts around the connectors, so now i have to replace those as well.  it is really hard to give up on somebody i have trusted with my and my wife's cars for decades, but i am not going back."

421,negative,this will be my second review on yelp about towbin dodge. to be honest when i buy a car off the lot i honestly don't expect to have issues with the vehicle. i have had a negative experience when it comes to dealing with the dealership upfront. the only positive experience i've had with towbin dodge was with a specialist named jerry. he was very kinda and understanding to my situation with my new vehicle.  i'd really like to speak with someone about fixing my vehicle because i feel like i have to hop through hoops to get things done talking with the dealership upfront... the first time my service transmission came on was a month and a half after i drove it off the lot... this is the second time.. 4 months later. i need this issue resolved immediately and i would like help from jerry (i don't remember his last name) or someone else just as compassionate.  please email right away. i know your busy but this is an urgent matter and i didn't expect this to happen again......

424,negative,"we've been bringing our vehicles here for years. usually they've been pretty good with the exception of my saturn which had the check engine light on (@75k miles) and the vehicle would ""bunny hop"" at a certain pressure on gas pedal at lower rpm. manchester claimed they consulted with honda for 4 hours and decided the valves needed adjusting. cost - $600. i picked up the car and paid. it drove like it was brand new. happy. parked car in driveway, next morning drove down the street. bunny hopping was back. brought it back to manchester, they again adjusted the valves at no extra cost. i picked up the car and again it drove like it was brand new. parked car in driveway, next morning drove down the street. bunny hopping was back. manchester said there was nothing else they could do, that i should just sell the car. hmmmph.

recently brought my truck (@150k miles) into manchester with a valve tap. they wanted to perform a diagnostic check for $90. i agreed. 1 week later i called (they never called me), they said they had to pull the engine apart to see what was ticking. cost, 1 or 2 hrs labor @ $119 per hour. 1 week later i called (they never called me), they said it was the lifters. cost - $450 for 1 side, $750 to do both just in case. i agreed to let them do both. 1 week later i called  (they never called me), they said they had to get a special tool and it would be another week. 1 week later i called (they never called me), they said that replacing all the lifters didn't fix the tap and it was the #5 lobe on the cam shaft that was worn and if i wanted ... they would rip the engine apart and replace the cam shaft for another $2000. i told them initially they could keep the truck and i would not pay but i needed the truck. 

i paid $900 over the phone and picked it up after hours and drove away with a trail of blue smoke billowing out the tail pipe for 5 miles. i checked the oil. ok. i ran the vehicle in park for 10 minutes with blue smoke still, then rode around the block a couple times - and smoke eventually disappeared. wtf?

after a whole month being in their shop and a $900 bill, i got new lifters but still have the tap. i feel like i was ripped off. i asked a friend of mine that designs engines for a major nascar team and his comment was they should have told you up front to replace the cam shaft, not just the lifters and they knew it. he said it like getting a tooth filled but not drilling out the decay, they did not fix root of the problem. i did not call back but did a survey they sent out with basically the same content here. i have not heard from them.

she takes the car in, they diagnose car and it says it's the transmission... as brandon is explaining to her what was going to happen (i can hear everything because i'm on the phone) he tells her he can't get started on the vehicle until the following monday (which was fine) but there was no way he could get her in a rental. at that point i asked to speak with him and i told him if it was in fact the transmission, they had to provide rental because my car is still under warranty and that my daughter couldn't be stranded in another state. brandon quickly turned into one of thee rudest service techs i have ever dealt with. he tells me they don't have to provide rental, that it's not gm policy to provide rental. he then goes on to tell me that i'm even lucky that this dealership was open on a saturday and it's a courtesy and i should be thankful. he then points out that if they weren't open, what would i have done.... he then goes on to tell me, don't you know the nicer you are to me the more i can do for you... really???? is that a policy of gm's.... won't be buying any cars from gm in the near future.... i've had many issues with my car since purchasing it brand new in 2012... it's had about 12 warranty issues... but never have i met a service technician sooooooo rude!!!!

service techs that repaired car deserve a two thumbs up but if one puts a bad taste in your mouth it ruins it for everyone else. i have lots of family that lives in las vegas and have informed them of the service i received (2 families have chevy's) neither will ever service their vehicles at this dealer.

just glad my daughter made it home safe!"
427,negative,"the only reason i'm giving this dealership 2 stars is the fact that they gave me a free oil change and a free water pump in return for the fact they had my car for forever and never even fixed the problem. first off, my car was making a strange vibration every time i got in my car, even if i started it or not. i took it in for a recall since i had just gotten noticed about it so i figured i'd mention the vibration while i was there. they tell me it will be ready the following day, which is totally fine. the next day comes around and they call and say they still don't have the parts in to fix my car, so by this time it's friday and they tell me it won't be ready until monday now since it was the weekend. already, i'm furious because i'm in school full time downtown and i work in north scottsdale so a car is most certainly a necessity for me. 

monday rolls around and she calls to tell me my car is finished and i could not be happier to finally have a car again. i get dropped off and she has me sign the papers of it being completed and she leaves to go get my car for me. 15 mins later, she's still not back with my car and she finally walks in and asks to speak with me outside. they didn't have my car done. she claimed someone laid the completed papers down on her desk and it wasn't actually finished. by this point, i was so impatient and irritated that i couldn't even stay to talk to her. they also claimed they didn't hear the noises... which is weird seeing as it still does it to this day every time i'm in my car. personally, i think my cpo 60,000 mile warranty that was almost up stopped them from replacing whatever it was creating that noise because it would have been too expensive to fix for them. 

the day finally came where my car was finished and within the same day, my check engine light came on and it was making a horrible grinding noise. i stopped in at firestone real quick and they took a look at my water pump, which was what was creating the grinding noise, and they fixed it for me right away. the guy told me whoever worked on my water pump didn't complete it all the way because a hose or a valve was completely undone and unattached from the fan. they fixed it for no charge.

all in all, i'm appreciative that volkswagen replaced my expensive water pump for free and gave me an oil change, but i'm so disappointed with their technicians and costumer service, especially when they didn't even complete the job when they had my car for a week longer than they should have. they will not be getting my business again for my 2010 tiguan. in my opinion, take it to peoria volkswagen. much better costumer service."
428,negative,"took my car here because my check engine light was on and my regulator is out on one of my windows. they said they needed to test the battery. upon giving me my car back the radio now has this loud static noise coming from it. they said it was doing that because i needed to replace the battery. now the battery is replaced the radio is still making the noise. they then tried to blame it on it being a aftermarket radio. now they are trying to say it's a grounding issue, but my car didn't have the noise or an grounding issues before they did whatever they did to battery. now they are refusing to fix a problem they caused. had to file a complaint with corporate this morning. hopefully i can get resolve for this issue, especially since my radio was working fine and had clear sound prior to the touching it!"
429,negative,"the woman that helped me is rude, stuck up, and unhelpful. i think it would literally kill her to smile. as i'm standing around i noticed she's giving attitude to everyone! i do not know how she got hired in the first place and has kept this job. at this point i had asked to be helped by another employee. 

i sat here for over 2 hours because they didn't have the correct air filter. i get up there to finish paper work and they didn't even check my check engine light or my other fluids. just noted some random things they did check. i don't know what they were even doing this entire time. i won't be coming back here again.

sooooo 2 weeks after my oil change, there's a huge puddle of oil under my car in my driveway. i can't drive it at this point, it needs to be towed. i make an appointment to go back to sears, which i'm completely dreading due to my last experience. but they need to fix whatever they broke. i make the appointment online and 4 days later the appointment get's cancelled because online sears thinks i needed to come pick up the service i ordered for my car... pick up an oil change...? are you kidding me? stupid, i'm done!!!"
430,negative,"avoid at all costs!

i'm not a car enthusiast by any means and when something goes wrong with my car, it's the biggest headache. my dad owns a kia and he brings it here. he's also brought my dodge caravan in as well for service. we haven't had a problem with them before besides them over charging, but this time was unacceptable. 

for the past few weeks, i've been hearing a loud roaring noise in my car. i called kia service and i tried to describe the problem to a guy name cory. he told me it sounds like an exhaust problem but i would still need to bring it in for a proper diagnostic. i brought it in at night for an appointment in the morning. me not knowing anything about cars and telling him that over the phone, described the problem on the key drop off envelope. they ""ran the diagnostic"" and determined that it was the muffler than needed replacing. when i picked it up and paid, as soon as i drove off the lot. the problem was not fixed at all. the only thing that changed was i was in the hole nearly $600.

i called back because they mention on their invoice a 100% satisfaction guaranteed. i mentioned the issue was not resolved and that it would need to be looked over again. i brought it in last night and they ""ran another diagnostic"" claiming it's the wheel barrings that was going to cost another $500. so we are putting an additional $500 dollars into a van that only has 62,000 miles. when cory called my mom on the phone to tell her what the problem was and what it would cost to fix it, my mom claimed the problem wasn't fixed and he said the car came in with an exhaust complaint. but i remember telling him on the phone that i couldn't determine what the problem was because i know nothing about cars. it was their responsibility to figure out what the problem was when they ran the diagnostic. he told me on the phone that it could be the exhaust so i took it on his expertise that they would be able to fix it. it wasn't my job to determine what was wrong with my car. i described the problem to my knowledge and it was kia service that is suppose to determine what was wrong. we are very very dissatisfied with this experience. this place will scam you up and down out of your money without fixing the problem the first time."
431,negative,"i have been a customer of christian brothers for a few years and have been  satisfied with the service that they provide my 3 cars.  however, this am i called requesting an oil change for my 2017 honda crv.  they could not provide me an apt until 7/12.  normally, this would be o.k., however, i explained that my engine light just came on last night and i needed it done by next monday (6 days from now) due to a planned road trip the following tuesday. i was then informed that if i needed other services they could schedule me sooner, but not for an oil change.  i mentioned the fact that i bring 3 cars there regularly and could not help the timing of the check engine light and planned road trip.  i even offered to drop my car off for an entire day.  they still said no.  i guess they don't make enough money off oil changes, but you would think that due to my past history with the business they would somehow find 60 min. within the next 6 days (4.5 working) to fit me in considering the circumstances.

i ended up calling the honda dealership and they were less expensive for an oil change anyway, so i guess i will take it there.  however, i prefer to use mom and pop shops so i will find a new one in the area to service my 3 honda's going forward."
432,negative,"i do not usually write reviews but on this experience, i feel like i have to. 
i brought my corvette to fairway  service department to have them fix the excessive vibration on the engine between 1800 rpm and 2000 rpm.
after only a few hours, i was told that everything was fine and that the vibration was normal for a corvette and that they checked other corvette and said that they found it to be similar. they told me that there is no check engine light fault and that they can not do anything because they will not get paid.
i seriously doubt their analysis and asked politely to show me a corvette that exhibits the similar vibration. then, the mechanic name brandon suddenly explode. he told me that they cannot have me check the other corvette for some reason or another. they told me that if i do not trust them, i am free to go to other dealers and have them fix it. i was told that their job was not to satisfy a customer.  these people are lazy and will not do anything until the computer tell so.
so i went to findlay. they were able to find the problem without relying on the engine light and fix it. the issue was the drive shaft. there is no sensor on those. even gave me a ride to and from the dealership. this is totally the opposite of the treatment i got from fairway"
433,negative,"its been a while since ive updated this but... just wanted to let everyone know that i still have had no additional issues with my truck. i have 40k miles on it now, which i believe is about 6k more than when i took it to chapman.  ive pulled my 18000lb rv with it out to ca and back to vegas a couple times, as well as out to central az and back, as well as shorter trips.  ive gone up some pretty steep inclines with it, and have had no problems.  i'm so glad i didnt let them didg into my transmission and waste my money... anywhere from 1200.00 to 4000.00 according to them.  for the cost of 2qts of trans fluid, the shop i took it to save me the time and money that chapman was going to cost me... and they didn't even know it was low on trans fluid.  what a waste of a service department.  if you dont like having unnecessary work done to yiur vehicle don't go to chapman... and if you do, always get second opinions when they suggest high dollar repairs."
434,negative,"this is a week after purchase. worse place to go to buy a car. 2nd car i bought from them and all they sell are lemons. i bought a newer car 2015 subaru wrx and it was inspected by them before i bought. i brought it in to subaru to have everything check and carmax didn't tell me their is a giant hole in the transmission. the car should have been sold in the first place. this place doesn't care, they just want to push cars out. i called them and before i can fight my way to get a manager all i keep hearing is its covered under 30 day warranty. wtf shouldn't have been sold and the hole is so big it will take 3-4 weeks to get back from  subaru. i warn people now to have your cars looked at immediately  after purchase. this company is a joke and before i get that stupid message saying to contact customer care. i already have! save your money and go somewhere else. they offer to return it but no replacements to switch with and they make it sound like it's my fault and it's such a inconvenience  for them."
435,negative,"i have an older wrangler that was running fine.  i was told by me mechanic of a recall on the emission system.  i took it in and after they had it all day they gave me back the jeep with a receipt saying they had reprogrammed the cpu and inspected the converter and all was good.  the next day i got a check engine light.  i had it diagnosed at autozone as a low threshold catalytic converter problem.  i took it to my mechanic who said the converter was bad and needed replacement.  he also said he was surprised this didnt show up during the work heggs did.  i know it's a 19 yr old car and things will go wrong, but when it was running fine and i let the dealer have it for a day and then get hit with a $500 bill it makes me regret ever going there."
436,negative,"van chevrolet service is terrible.  our truck was originally brought in to replace the transmission shift cable that was covered under warrantee.  it took a week for the work to be done and when we got the truck back, the rear parking camera was not working. when they fixed the transmission cable, they disconnected the back up camera. we had to take it back in for repair (another 2 days).

i just took the truck on a trip and the cruise control would not work.  problem is associated with the prior repair. when they replaced the shift cable, the cruise module was disconnected. we made an appointment and dropped the truck off on thursday.  didn't hear anything by friday afternoon so i called to follow up.  after getting transferred to 3 different people, they couldn't find the paper work and would have to call me back.  after waiting until 5 pm, they called back and said they hadn't worked on it and it would be ready on monday.  keep in mind, we had an appointment for the repair on thursday.

it's now monday afternoon and no word on the truck.  i just called the dealer at 4 pm and was put on hold and then hung up on.  i called back and finally spoke to a person.  he could not find the paperwork but said he would have a service advisor call me.  i have waited for over an hour and still no call back.

i just want the vehicle fixed and returned.  i do not recommend this dealer for service and will contact another gm dealer for any future warranty or service work."
437,negative,"oh my gosh what a horrific experience. i took my car there because my transmission was slipping, the next day i called and asked to see when it would probably be done, he said come down after 1230. well i didn't make it down there till 3 o'clock. i walked in and he proceeded to lecture me on how to drive my car. i honestly think that's when they started working on my car. so an hour later around 4 o'clock he finally ,took me out to the garage where my car was, and it look like he was just finishing up. he told me that he was just topping off my transmission fluid making sure it was full.   there a transmission fluid all over the floor. i wasn't even a block down the street and learned that my car wasn't even engaging in gears,,, i heard grinding and it was slipping even  worse than when i brought it there. when i got home i noticed there were scratches on my car that weren't there before there was transmission fluid all over my floor mats in the front and transmission fluid dripping down the front of my car by the wheels both sides of the hood, what a freaking mess, hopefully all that went wrong was he didn't put enough fluid in and there was no damage. but it sounded horrible coming home. i honestly think no one has the mechanics license in that place. no one knew what they were doing. i would not recommend this place at all it was a horrific experience"
438,negative,"this place came recommended by my old mechanic, but after going there, i wont be back. one day took my vehicle in for an oil change, and within the first 5 miles after service, the check engine light comes on.   its still unclear what caused the light, but i gave them the benefit of the doubt and brought my second car in the next day.  
i asked for oil change with full synthetic and trans drain and refill  and install new filter.  they told me this car has no trans filter, and i tried to show them online it shows an external filter in-line on trans hoses.  even showed where and how to access it. they insisted it has no filter, and refused to look at my info i offered.  after done, i got home and looked at my paperwork, i see that they  don't listen to customers at all, as they gave me standard oil and not the requested synthetic.  also, on checking my fluid levels, i find that my trans is grossly overfilled which is just as bad as under filling.  wish i could recommend. they were fairly polite even in arguing my point on the trans filter, but thats the only reason they didnt get one star.  
by the way, after todays service, im totally convinced they did something yesterday to cause my engine light to come on."
439,negative,"*update* *****1 star because the day after my detail service, my car's transmission began failing and mechanics believe it was due to an inexperienced manual driver paired with a loosened bolt. *****don't waste your time/money on their detailing services. the automatic wash does 200% better. they had my car for over 24 hours and i spent about $300 on this crap job. they wouldn't give me any type of refund and wouldn't even reimburse me for uber costs. the only thing they offered me were car wash vouchers, which i am already a vip member who pays $40 a month for their best car wash services. and then i never even got the vouchers haha. the detail guys and the detail manager on duty were lame, didn't give a crap about my situation. i give 2 stars only for the rest of jackson's car wash employees. the desk girls, the automatic car wash guys and all the employees who dry the cars off and apply tire dressing, they are always smiling and pleasant. but detail department ruined my rating i'll be downgrading my car wash package and will never recommend business with their detail department."
440,negative,"we have a 2001 honda crv that we had the transmission serviced at expert transmissions.  they charged $100 for the transmission service and $79.95 for the trans filter\gasket for a total of $186.43 with tax.  we found out later in the day that a 2001 honda crv doesn't use a trans filter\gasket so we called back expert transmission, he said he hit the wrong button, he meant to charge us for transmission fluid, so if we come back in he'd give us a couple bucks back.  

called findlay honda and they said a transmission service would cost $119.95."
441,negative,"i took my 2007 accord there for an oil change and transmission fluid replacement, it was fine till they said all four brakes needed to be replaced, as i normally don't do that at dealers because it is expensive, went two different local shops and they both said my brakes are fine! auto nation honda said they were 20% wear when the two local shops said fronts were at 60% and the rears were at 50%, just tried to take 400 dollars for something that did not need to be done."
442,negative,"8 months ago i traded in my ram truck for a dodge charger rt so my family could be more comfortable specially my son that was about to be born when i got it. when i brought the new car they gave it to me and it already had 1000 miles and i told them it was not new and they said yes because that was the first time selling it and supposedly only drove by the owner of the dealer ship. after a week that i bought it i started noticing and having some problems with the stereo and back up camera so i went back to dealer and told them what was going on they told me to wait until i made my first payment so it could get check and get fix. so i wait time went by and i made my first appointment and then i took it to service well the camera wasn't working even after they supposedly fix it and i have videos of that! then i started having issues with the ac and the car started losing power, i didn't care about the losing power part but what really pissed me off was that it was super hot and the ac was not working and my 6 months old baby was in the car with me and i also have videos of that. everyone that know las vegas know how hot gets during this times and having a brand new car with no ac and a baby in there is super dangerous. i called them again to make an appointment so the gave me an appointment few days later but for every time i took the car to them they made me pay $50 dollars for a rental car, a car that wasn't even compared to what i brought from them. so they call me in because supposedly they fix all the problems and they made me drive with the technician guy well guess what that car wasn't not responding and working properly again. so they blame it on the stereo they said take the car and we will call you to bring it back once we get the parts. days went by and car turned on the check engine light i thought myself this is way too much so i call them again to make an appointment and they had it for service for 4 days again and their answer is that they replaced the pcm of the car, are you kidding me replacing a brand new car pcm and stereo??? so they call me to tell me that the car was ready i went and picked it up. car still not working properly and they just messed it up more because i started having troubles with the steering wheel. now they have it in for service again for the fourth time, i honestly don't want that car anymore because that car had problems since the beginning and the workers and manager acted like nothing was going on. i don't trust it and i don't feel my family or i are safe in it and they're not doing anything to help me! worst experience ever!!!"
443,negative,"let's actually tell what happened. after fighting tooth and nail about the problem which took a month and half to fix. car max solution was to take it back and put me in a older subaru. i don't see how that was a solution, i feel like it's a insult and buying a car that was shipped and looked at before purchase tells me how shitty your service department is. how can anyone miss a giant hole in the transmission. i will never do business with any car max and will always tell family and friends how horrible this company is."
444,negative,"1 hour time quote turned into over two, and my oil change and trans  service turned into a $1000 quote.  it's hard to find a mechanic you can trust, and the business had changed hands, and completely turned over staff from the previous times i had come in for service.  i ended up having the basic work done - oil change, transmission service, battery service, but left the ac up to someone else. the language barrier didn't help. telling me the ac compressor ""is froze"" meant nothing to me. i need a mechanic who can explain what's going on with my vehicle."
445,negative,"fcuk this place

literally a week after the 90 day warranty expired, the motor started violently shaking, the transmission shutters, one of speakers blew out rendering all audio and alarms useless(i'm in my 30's- never had the radio louder than half way turned up).

i'll be sure to let usaa who certifies san tan ford as a military friendly dealer about the fcuked car they sold me. 

oh and the service department charges $50 to run a diagnostic on the pos used car they sold me. 

they also claim it takes ford a week to send parts. it's 2016, amazon can get you a package in an hour.

i've owned 4 ford vehicles, this car will be my last ford and i'll be sure to let the ford corporation know.

it just keeps getting worse
my engine was shaking violently. when i brought my car in for an oil change the woman that received my car acted like it wasn't a big deal. after the diagnostic, service department claimed it needed a motor mount. said it would take a week. got no phone calls or voicemail when the parts came in. ended up taking three weeks to get parts. after they serviced my car. the engine now shakes harder and more frequently."
446,negative,"perfect location near campus and close to restaurants and shopping. the beds are nice and the bathroom is adequate. the toiletries are adequate but you may want to bring your own if you have sensitive skin. i stayed one night, on a college visit with my teenaged son. the desk staff was grumpy and not especially helpful but that didn't matter much. the food was not so great but we didn't expect much either.

the thing that made our stay a big challenge was the sound transmission between rooms. we had especially amorous neighbors and could hear every detail of their very athletic and vocal activities several times through the night and in the morning when they were in the shower. and i mean every detail, including their words to each other. needless to say, that made for an awkward night with a teen boy in the room and a really bad night's sleep. the most fun was when they showed up at breakfast. if you want to sleep or if you want a private get away beware of the sound issue."
447,negative,"if i could give them less than one star i would. have been taking this vehicle there for many many years, made an appointment to drop it off the next day. i waited over 7 1/2 hours to hear back from them, and then still couldn't tell me what was wrong. they then told me it would be 1000 dollars to open the transmission and diagnosis what might be wrong. that was not to fix it just to diagnose. mind you everyone else only charges about 85 dollars. then they were going to charge me to get my vehicle back to their shop, i never authorized it to be taken elsewhere. not only have they lost my longtime business but my entire families. and i will tell everyone i know to never patronize this business."
448,negative,"just relocated to arizona. scheduled an oil change  and also to have my transmission checked. i have an additional warranty due to having issues with my transmission. when dropping off my car i was told that they can do the warranty work but it would take 3-4 days because they are busy and i would have to pay for a rental. they would only provide a car for one day. seriously!?!? a known defect with a warranty and they want me to pay for a car? the guy must have said 3 or 4 times that they were the busiest service center in the area, that's why it would take so long. even asked for an appointment at a different time and was told it would still take 3-4 days and they wouldn't give me anything to drive. they will never get my business again and i will be calling the ford corporate office. they were supposed to wash my car after the oil change and that didn't happen either... must have been too busy."
449,negative,"after 50 miles the transmission they rebuilt is leaking everywhere!! since i did not drive the vehicle right after rebuild they will not honor anything! took no responsibility for any work done and i needed to pull the transmission and take it down to even be looked at? never again will i go there, i was warned by a friend and i should have listened!!! stay away at all cost!!!"
450,negative,"i first got the tires aligned for around $70 and they wanted me to change bearing hub and did a math calculation (parts+(man hours x work time x 5 times real price)=ripoff.

they wanted to charge $300 for a job another mechanic did for $50. as well, i detected a leak so they suggested steam cleaning (they charge $89.95) also got oil change (another $60) then they refused to do a brief diagnostic on why i had a check engine light on because they wanted to charge another $89.95 for diagnostic.. after providing push back they did a quote for around $700 when the actual matter was the oil pan seal.

at the end, i wanted to take advantage of the 6 months warranty for tire alignment, went back and they did the fastest tire alignment.. i did an appointment and had to see how 3 walk ins took my spot and literally the tire alignment lasted 5 minutes!!!! obviously the car is not aligned because they didn't do anything.

since the company has ""good year"" brand on its name i was expecting nothing but high quality, i guess it's a marketing technique to steal money out of consumer's pocket!"
451,negative,i wish i didn't need to add any stars because then don't deserve any stars then suck so bad i took my car 2012 honda accord to get services because it was about that time i have then honda care so i figured i will get it all checked out went in then told me everything was good any so i took it home i  decide to check my car any found that then didn't top off any of my fluids everything was low and i called complained and spoke with then new customer service manager i took it back a second time thought i will give then another chance and then did a bad job again no transmission fluid or coolant i will never never never take my car back again oh and by then way then have dishonest thief's working there
452,negative,"so i have been taking my car to kerry's for over 2 years. they have treated me pretty good, so i keep going back. today however, is a different story. i took my car to them for an oil change and tire rotation. i used the annual checkup coupon that offers oil change, tire rotation, battery check, fluid check, yada yada yada... for $20. i chocked my tires to make sure the tires were rotated, because the last time i took my car to them they supposedly rotated my tires, when in-fact they did not. i did an upgrade on the oil its like mao oil i think, and just paid the difference. my check engine light was on when i brought the car to them, they never even told me the light was on, let alone what the problem was. when i got home, i remembered to check the tires, and sure enough, they didn't rotate them. this worries me. if they cannot rotate the tires when you ask them to, what else do they conveniently forget to do? add oil to your car? or, what if they don't even bother to do the oil change? how do you know? 

one thing i could all way's count on when i bring my car to them:honesty. about six months ago i learned of a small leak in the power steering line, kerry's never bothered to let me know the leak was any worse then it was six months ago. it is all most as if they just rushed me out of there, completing half the work. this is the first bad experience with them. i will go back for oil changes, but i'm going to watch them. this i hate to do, but my trust in them has wavered."
453,negative,"beware-they will try to rip you off by recommending unnecessary services.  they also charge vague ""shop fees"" that they do not warn you about.

i took my old toyota in and they recommended a transmission flush.  the service manager was very pushy, so i reluctantly went head.  a couple hours later, i get a call saying that my car is so old is cannot handle a high pressure flush, and that they would need to replace a fluid line and order new parts.  they were very pushy, so again i reluctantly went ahead.  

a couple days later while waiting for the part, it all of a sudden dawned on me that such an old car does not really even need a flush.  a simple drain and fill would be more than sufficient.  i called to cancel the service and refund the part, but they refused at first.  after much hassle, i finally got my refund.  

in general, i would avoid their parts/service department and go to alternative solution or the lusty wrench instead."
454,negative,"let's actually tell what happened. after fighting tooth and nail about the problem which took a month and half to fix. cat max solution was to take it back and put me in a older subaru. i don't see how that was a solution, i feel like it's a insult and buying a car that was shipped and looked at before purchase tells me how shitty your service department is. how can anyone miss a giant hole in the transmission. i will never do business with any car max and will always tell family and friends how horrible this company is."
455,negative,"took my grand cherokee in for a recall and some leaks to be repaired in late july/early august. the recalls were done just fine. but the leaks were not done correctly. $1500 later my transmission still leaks and they refused to fix it 3 weeks after the original repair unless i paid them more money. horrible customer service from service advisor holly but no complaints about anthony, he's always been pleasant even at 6am. i will not take any vehicle back to this shop again. if i could give zero stars i would."
456,negative,"i'm not sure what happened.  i got a quote on brakes and struts.  i could afford the brakes and got them fixed.  had to raise the money for the struts.  when i got the money, i tried every way i knew to make an appointment to get the struts.  nobody ever responded.  i didn't know if they were too busy for me or not.  i had to get the work done.  so, i went someplace else and was taken big time.  wound up having to sell my car because the transmission was mysteriously in bad shape after a tune up by the other mechanic. i wish they had made time for me since i did get the money to pay for the struts.  but, i never heard from them again and had to go elsewhere.  as a result, i had to sell my car for much less than it was worth because of the mysteriously bad transmission. :-(   i don't know where to take my car now.  seems every mechanic i go to tries to take me for as much as they can."
457,negative,"i have to give a two star review for the place i purchased my car from in 2004. i have all my life been a chevy person! my first car was a 1958 chevy impala. my air conditioner went off. being a senior, and a woman, i brought my car to fairway hoping for a decent repair and price. i said to change the oil with synthetic oil, and a lube job. they called me within 20 minutes in the rental truck, stating my ball and pinion were leaking, and my tie rod was going out. that it would cost $350.00. i said ok. that was friday. on monday i called, they told me it would be $1800.00 plus the cost of the a/c. oil and lube. then they tried to charge me for a diagnostic of 150.00 for the ball and pinion. the head of service took that charge off. now, my car is making a noise it never made before. 4 years ago i brought my car here and they told me i needed a new transmission and a compressor. needless to say, this is/was not true. i did not believe them then, and now, when i purchase a new car, i am sad to say, it will not be from fairway chevrolet again. my car has 82,000 miles, of gentle driving to work and back. i had to give a star for getting me into a rental truck at a great price. the whole thing is, now my car makes a noise that is getting worse daily. i will be finding some where else for my car now. i don't trust fairway any more.so it cost me over 1000.00 to get oil change, and new motor for the a/c. motor was 250.00 and labor was 325.00. just for the ac motor. then 80.00 rental. such an expense to receive my car back making new noises. very disappointed and sad. this was where i all these years purchased my car in 2004, paid it off payment by payment, never late. to be treated like this is just so disappointing. i would never recommend fairway to anyone ever again! by the way, no car wash at all. there is one, but they did not wash mine. i have a car wash i can go through but the point is, it should have been done there to present my car back to me."
458,negative,"we dropped our vehicle off saturday to have them check why it sputters upon acceleration. they never called us back (after 3 calls to them) to let us know it was ready.  monday afternoon they called and said  they ""jiggled some wires"" test drove it and they claimed it was fine, but if the check engine light comes on, bring it back. not even 24 hours later it came on, we dropped it off monday night and now it's tuesday afternoon and not a single call from them.  their communication clearly needs work, and after 2 whole days of having our car and not being able to find out what's wrong with it is unacceptable.  even if they find out what's wrong with it before they close today, they will have to keep it another day or so to potentially fix what's wrong with it.  this would not have been such a rotten experience had they just kept us informed once, or even twice, even if to just say ""hey, we are still working on it and will call you"".  at this point, we are getting the vehicle and taking it elsewhere.  if you decide to go with fletcher's, be prepared to have little to no communication about what's going on with your vehicle."
459,negative,"buying experience was good, as i had previously written. 

but the service department is another story. i had to have the ""heart replacement"" equivalent of service done to my car. new engine, transmission, suspension, brakes. it was a mess. i was not offered a loaner vehicle at all, and the communication was poor while my car was in for service. the lady at the counter just handed me the multiple-pages of documents and keys detailing one of the biggest car repairs in history and offered no further explanation

a month later after fixing what was obviously a lot of issues, i received a car that was horrendously dirty, and not fully fixed. the alignment is obviously off, and when they replaced some door latches (this was a known recall), they broke the keyless access that comes with the car.

a great place to buy, but not a great place to get service. when you have to replace everything and the kitchen sink in a car, you should do a full inspection. how they did not realize how off the alignment was completely off and that features were broken on the car is beyond me."
460,negative,"worst service department ever.  i bought a used ford truck from the in may. before i bought it i told them that the rear differential was leaking and i wanted it replaced. the salesman gave me a blank stare like he didn't know what i was talking about. well i put a deposit down on the truck and when they had it fixed they would give me a call.  what should of taken a day or two ended up taking a week.  every time i called i would get some half ass answer. they kept telling me different days when i could pick it up. i finally had enough when the day i was suppose to pick it up they told me it was on a lift because they where changing the tires and that the guy left without putting the new tires on it. i finally snapped and went off on them. 

well 6 months later my throttle body went out, so i take it to the service department to have it looked at. next thing i know they are calling back saying that the transmission was bad, the drive shaft, spark plugs and a whole bunch of other crap needed to be fixed. i'm talking to the manager  saying how the hell can all the stuff go bad after having it for 6 months.  well the warranty covered the trans and some of the other things. went to go look at the parts they said need to be replaced and most of them had nothing wrong with it. they will rip you off so bad if they think you know nothing about cars. after a month of waiting for my truck to get done i finally get it back.  after 2 days my engine light comes on again and i call and find out the they didn't replace the throttle body instead they rewired it. i said screw it and took it to ford and they replaced it in a day and i come to find out the towbin didn't check crap on the truck cause my spark plugs should of been replaced 7 months ago before i even bought the truck and some other crap. biggest ripoff in my life. made my first time buying a truck the worst experience in my life. never buying from them again and advise people to never go there if they are looking for a car. i'm only giving them one star cause i can't leave them with a half a star."
461,negative,"the reviews on here are a lot more generous than those on google, so i guess i should have checked both...the first time i went, my watch went missing.  i figured it was my own fault, and i'd know better next time.  then the second time, they stole petty stuff (change from the center console, a digital tire pressure reader, etc), and i figured that i just wouldn't go back.  today, my girlfriend surprised me with a detail...so i go...and now my car with 16k miles on it has a check engine light on, an airbag malfunction light on and a stability control light on.  the must have known they did it, because someone fumbled around with the display before i got the car back...but nobody said anything when they turned the car over.  

all in all, i spent $300 on details and lost $400 on stolen personal items and whatever the hell it's going to cost me to get the car fixed.  this isn't just sloppy work, it's theft."
462,negative,"i took my kia soul  in to have a warranty check on it. the guy told me i would be charged 112.55 if they didn't find anything. well they found that my car rack and pinion was bad and under warranty. here's the kicker, fyi never ever tell a dealership your check engine light has come on. cause instead of telling me hey we are gonna charge u the 112.55 because we are diagnostic checking it, and that won't be under ur manufacture warranty. i would have said never mind i'll take it to autozone to have chexked. i feel they did me dirty, as far as the 112.55, cause the outcome was a oil change was needed. so 1. why didn't u say as a customer service hey let's comp ur oil change since u have to pay for the diagnostic. no instead i'm using a credit card and paying for somethi g i really can't afford. thanks kia finley i will remember ur customer service when i'm ready to buy a new kia"
463,negative,"let me start by saying i'm a regular customer at ford and even bought the vehicle i'm referring to at the san tan ford dealership. this place has the worst customer service i've ever experienced. this isn't the first time i've been disappointed with them, but it is the worst! i pulled into their service department because my check engine light had come on while i was on the freeway. when i arrived, all i was asking them to to was ""plug in their ""code reader"" i was told they couldn't help me. i explained that i just wanted to know if i was going to hurt the car by driving it? he said he couldn't tell me. i asked.....if i leave the car with you, do you have loaner cars or rental cars....he said we are out of rental cars. he literally would not do anything to help me. he told me to call today to make an appointment for monday so they could reserve me a rental car. then and only then, i could drop it off on monday and leave it with them all day tuesday.....and this is just to tell me why the light is on! but i basically had to drive the car home. he (i'm not kidding) handed me 5 business cards to use when i call because he says it can be difficult to reach the service writers! i then drove to network automotive by my house. they immediately took the car into their shop, read the code, cleared the light on the dash, and told me it was probably an 02 sensor and had to do with emissions. he said if the light comes back on then i'd need to go to ford because anything emissions is covered under my warranty. well unfortunately the light did come back on but i will not be coming back to san tan ford! i will go out of my way to a different dealership because they don't deserve my business."
464,negative,"this place is a joke about 6 months ago they told me i needed to replace my transmission and it would cost 4000.00.  i contacted corporate and they made a deal to only charge me 2000.00.  this was at 100,000 miles.  i now have 140000 miles on my vehicle and i called to get the 120000 mile service....they tell me it will be 1000.00.  this is a complete rip off.  i remember when these types of service were 200 -300 dollars.  now they are 1000.00??  i will never ever buy a nissan again.  and just for the record any other automotive service in las vegas, advised me we will do a free inspection and only charge you for items that ""need"" to be replaced."
465,negative,"my power steering went out while i was driving and i had to have my car towed here to have it looked at. omar called me the next day and quoted me $500 to replace a belt and get a new battery and flush the power steering. i picked it up the next day and everything seemed okay. 24 hours later the exact thing happens to me on the highway in the middle of driving again. at this point i was overwhelmed and annoyedand thinking i wasted $500. i call the dealership five times, nobody answers. my dad and i both left messages and omar never called either of us back and meanwhile i'm broken down on the side of the road again. finally we get ahold of a guy named frank and he offers to send a tow truck and have the car looked at. we open the hood and the same belt that they had just ""replaced"" is completely shredded like it was the first time. they keep my car for another two days and fail to communicate with me or my dad about what the problem is with the car or what's going on, still haven't heard a word from omar. frank hasn't even called back. i finally get ahold of omar and he was really short on the phone with me and said nothing about what was wrong with the car. he also knew who i was based on my phone number alone so i'm thinking he was purposely not answering me or calling back. he just told me it was ready to be picked up. i show up to get it and omar gets me the keys and doesn't say more than two words to me. they didn't charge me anything this time but i got in my car and the check engine light is now on and it wasn't before. omar didn't apologize once for the bad service or the zero communication on his part. i don't expect to be treated like royalty ever and i've worked crappy customer service jobs before and this just isn't how you treat people. a manager should've communicated with me and told me what was going on but they didn't want to admit that they installed the belt incorrectly. the least you could do is apologize and maybe refund some of the ridiculous $500 i paid for a job that wasn't even done correctly and ended up costing me five days of having no car and unnecessary hours broken down on the side of the road."
466,negative,"service here has been ok in the past, but today was hands down the worst service i've had changing oil and/or washing my car ever.

i dropped my car off, and first their price is higher than most other places for a synthetic oil change.  i thought to myself: ""convenience of both oil change and car wash in one shot might be worth it today"".

so longer story short, they vacuum the car, then change the oil. charge me $76 for both services, then when they give me the car it turns out they didn't wash it at all.
so the manager proceeds to hand wipe the car in and out in front of me. now this has made me late for the rest of my day.  of course he can't get all the stains out, and to top it off as i'm driving away i notice they never reset the 'check engine light'.  more bad service, now i need to dig through the manual (or google) and reset the thing myself.  

if it was cheap service, i'd give it a little more leeway, but $76 for that kind of service? naa ahh!"
467,negative,terrible service.  i took my car in to have a simple oil leak fixed.  i had to take it back a second time because they didn't clean oil off a sensor and the check engine light was on.  now a third time because they reinstalled the alternator belt when it had oil on it and they expect me to pay to again remove everything to replace this belt.  very disappointing!
468,negative,"first of all, i'd like to say that i already left a review on 11/30/16 which does not show up on this page. an update: i took my car to the toyota dealership, and they told me my alignment was wayyyy off. i'd go back to argue for a refund, but such a bad experience last time i'm just done dealing with them. all the managers there look like they're on steroids that prey on women, why bother.
so, they ""fixed"" my car (i was there for a flat tire and they recommended $1500 worth of repairs), after which my check engine light keeps coming on (3 times now), hoses have come loose that they ""fixed"". air caps were not even put on my tires, so who knows what they neglected to do on the inside. i had to pump up my tires with air because the brand new tires that are under 60 day warranty were at 20 psi. needless to say they didn't honor the warranty. i hope you guys enjoy your $1500, i'm never ever coming back."
469,negative,"if i could give negative stars i would. do not purchase carmax max care warranty! they are the biggest crooks on the planet. they make it imposes to get your car repaired or to speak to someone on the phone or in writing. because of their lack of communication with us i was forced to hire an attorney, file a complaint with the better business bureau, wasted countless hours on the phone and suffered extreme disappointment and anxiety from not being able to get anywhere with this company. it has been nine months that my vehicle has been in operable and i have yet to get a return response from someone at this company. i am now forced to start arbitration which is just as difficult as getting your car repaired because the only way to start arbitration is to schedule a date with max care warranty and you know how that goes. crickets crickets crickets. they will avoid contact at all costs to not hold responsibility. do yourself a huge favor and purchase independent warranty."
470,negative,"should have checked yelp ratings before buying a car here. 3 days after buying a car, my check engine light turned on and almost had an accident in the middle of the road when my 2 day old car suddenly lost power; i was pressing on the gas but it only go 20mph and my rpm is up to 4 already; good thing there were no cars coming behind me. and now on the 3rd day we brought the car back at the dealership, been waiting for more than 3hours, nobody even have the courtesy to tell us how long we will wait. they don't have a loaner car to provide us, not even a rental car. and we are stuck here with nobody updating us. i am pregnant and i am tired of waiting. at least have the courtesy to inform us how long we have to wait for their shuttle service that will drop us home. it is so ironic how we just bought a car but have to wait for shuttle service or even probably have to take the bus for a week because they sold us a crappy car and don't even provide a loaner/rental car. ugh! i hate this dealership! beware of this company, they will do anything to sell you a car ... even if these cars are used and not inspected very well."
471,negative,"i am rating my experience with pete's transmission as 1 star. i originally took my trailblazer there because it would not shift out of second gear after about an hour of driving. they took my truck on a test drive as well as hooked it up to a scanner and said i needed to have my transmission rebuilt. 
so on a monday i dropped it off and by thursday it was ready. the very next day i went to back out of the parking space at the store and the shift lever moves freely but the truck stays in park. so i had to leave my truck overnight. pete's was closed due to a family event. in the meantime i had a friend tell me to check to see if the shift cable was connected to the transmission. sure enough it had some how come loose. so i snapped it back together. and i was able to shift out of park and through all the gears. 
about 300miles later the truck started to take a long time(5-10seconds) to get up to speed from the stoplight, like it was in a higher gear or something. again after it's been driven awhile. so i took it back to pete's they kept it couple days then told me they changed one of the shift solenoids. after driving it a couple days it again started to do the same thing after coming to a stop. the truck once it gets warm it won't shift out of the higher gear. i took to pete's again and they tell me that i have an ignition module problem. and that i need to take it to another shop they recommend to have them look at it. oh by the way it would be $90 for them to look at. so long story short either pete's charged me for a transmission rebuild i didn't need. because it was always an electrical problem. or the rebuild work they did was shoddy.  that's my experience with pete's transmission. 

update to my experience. i took my truck to another transmission shop. they told me i did not have a module problem. they said they needed to disassemble the transmission to take a look. they allowed me to look at the parts that were supposedly replaced from the rebuild at pete's aswell as parts that should have been replaced but we're not.  since they rebuilt my transmission it has been running great. i was not happy with the price however  i think they way overcharged me $2700 was the total price. so i am not giving that shops name. but at least my truck is running now."
472,negative,"i bought a new hybrid sonata in october 2013. they said i was all set with the dmv as they had switched the tag over to the new car. i was pulled over in november and the police had no record of the car being registered. i had to straighten all of that out myself, including going to court, and never got so much as an apology from hyundai. in march, i brought the car in for an oil change, and jerome informed me i needed a new transmission because i must have hit something and it was irreparably damaged. (?) i had not had an accident! maybe hit a speed bump and scraped the bottom, but not even enough of a concern to pull over.
there was a sketchy vibe to the guys all staring at me while he spoke very quickly. well they still have my car 3 weeks later, after many annoying phone calls about insurance and $ (i have good insurance), and now they claim they haven't gotten the insurance check and will not release the car even though it has been ready for over a week. at one point they called to say i could pick up the car and when i went to get it,  they couldn't find the insurance check. they made me wait while they called my insurance co. and i finally left and told them to call me when the car was really ready. on another call they wanted my credit car payment over the phone before i picked up the car. every interaction i have had here they have been unprofessional bordering on rude. you might have success buying a car here, but look elsewhere for service."
473,negative,"last week i called in to have my honda crv serviced with an oil change and to have the tpms checked.  when i brought it in to have work done on the 10th of november, the staff was very kind and friendly.  the greeter took my car information and handed it to the technician.  the technician was friendly and said looks like you are here for an a13 service. i said i am here to have the oil changed and have the tpms light addressed.  we discussed the tpms a bit and he handed me a pen with the estimate sheet for me to sign.  he said the estimate will be around 200 + dollars, but will be less than that depending my warranty.  i said that it is platnum warranty, so i'm not too concerned and i took a curtesy cab to work.  

later that morning the technician called me and said that it would be 300 + dollars for the service and i said for what, the oil change and tpms issue which should be covered?  he said no, the a13 is an oil change, transmission fluid change and a brake system purge.  i told him that at no time during our conversation did he mention the transmission and brake work.  he said he thought i understood that.  i asked him to look at the estimate sheet and see if anywhere on there does it say transmission and brake work.  it does not, it says a 1 3.  this is not the first time i have had to address this type issue with this tech.  

on my first oil change after purchasing my car from zimbrick, i had a large bill for the same reason, deceptive sales tactics.  

i asked for an oil change and for the tpms light to be addressed.  i ask him if i could speak to a manager when i came to pick up the car at 4 o'clock and he said sure.  we hung up the phone and i called the tech back to confirm that a manager would be there.  he corrected himself and said that there would not be a manager there at 4. again, deceptive. so i asked him to get a manager on the line.  i spoke with the manager.  he was professional, but kept on referring to how the service call center is going under some training on what the codes are.  that is not my concern.  i called to have an oil change and tpms address and the tech did not confirm that with me.  i go into a business expecting to have work done that i want done, not what the business wants done.  i found this to be very poor customer service and again, deceptive, to make extra money on jobs that don't need to be done.  who really knows what an a13 service is?  this should be explained by the tech.  

i cannot say enough how disappointed i am with a business that is supposed to be professional.  the staff was kind, but i believe that is all a cover for deceptive tactics.  a smile while they dip into your wallet."
474,negative,"do not go here. went in for an oil change and after it was done, the check engine light came on. first, they put in the wrong oil. then, they said it had something to do with the o2 sensor. so all of a sudden it's messed up when it was perfect before you guys touched it?!"
475,negative,"if i could give carmax 0 stars i would. i bought a chevy cruze from this carmax a little over 2 years ago and have spent over $5000 on repairs since. i was sold a piece of crap car. during all the repairs i have come to discover that carmax did not change the transmission fluid or spark plugs before selling it to me...both of which would have been due for a change at the 60,000 mile mark which was much lower than the mileage i bought it at. this car has been my worst nightmare and a drain on my bank account. after this $3000 repair i plan to immediately look for a trade in from an honest dealer."
476,negative,"i took my 2002 honda accord to this location on march 25th to have regular maintenance done on my transmission. i asked if they would recommend a flush or a drain and fill. i was told with the miles on my car they would have to ask their ""expert"" service advisor. the guy comes back and states after their ""expert"" evaluated my car that they recommend a flush. i asked once again if they were sure and he assured me it was fine to do the flush. needless to say sears destroyed my transmission in the process. i have been told by 3 different transmission specialists that they should have never flushed my transmission. this came from a combined experience of working on transmissions of close to 60 years. they gave me the run around for over a month and they offered to only pay if someone could tell them without a doubt that they caused the destruction of my transmission. i explained i'm on a fixed income and i could not afford out of pocket expenses, that fell on deaf ears. here is the problem with someone saying without a doubt they caused it...all sears has to say is that the metal shavings that sears loosened u were already in the transmission. that is sear's out on taking responsibility for the damage sears caused. i would recommend that no one take their vehicle to these ""experts""."
477,negative,"all i've heard is good things about wayne's. i used to gas up there whenever i was in town. i just moved from arizona 10 days ago. the idiots at u-haul in flagstaff managed to get the car at a angle and ripped off a few pieces including my front bumper, and the rear springs finally were broken in thanks to u-haul.

so when i got to madison to start my new life, i made a appointment with waynes. from all the good reviews, i expected the service others recieved. i told them exactly what i was having issues with, and waited a week to get in. got to the shop and whomever was the mechanic told me there wasn't anything he could do because of aftermarket parts. i asked about the transmission and was told the car would have to sit for 4-5 hours, but wouldn't take the time to wait. the engine underside skid plate had been ripped off. wouldn't put it on because it was damaged, pulled my car out and went to work on something else. he pulled out my car and told me to leave. i don't know what caused the attitude. i asked for another shop and they thought there might be one on the west side of town. looked online and found and found kelly-moss was a dealer for the kw suspensions. they got me right in with no issues. i'll still give a couple stars for the gas station and people working the counter. i won't give any for the tech who should have looked at the jobs coming up and could have told me they wouldn't work on it. luckily other there are other options in madison which they were too busy to give me a referell for a shop that could do the work, or a body shop to fix the bumper. they said maybe a shop on the west side. fifteen minutes later i was sitting in the waiting room at kelly-moss while they took car of it."
478,negative,"9/7/18 took my car in for an oil change and the check engine light happens to be on. it has been 3 days since i took my car there and they have not given me updates on what is going on. on top of that, i've called more than 5x and get the same answer ""the service consultants are busy right now"" it's ridiculous, to me it seemed like nothing is being done about my car and it's just sitting there while i have to find an alternative ride to work."
479,negative,"i purchased a kia sorrento from the dealership in april, have had a few issues with the check engine light coming on. service department told me on three occasions that it was nothing to worry about, so far they are right. two weekends ago we had our suitcases fall into the rear storage compartment, brought it to the dealership first service employee stated he would have to wait for his boss. after the service manager returned, he stated we can t fix this we will contact out kia representative who will be here on september 18th. i was told to bring it in on the 18th so he could look at it, today 9/18/15 i get a call (scott crockett). our representative is late and leaving in ten minutes, but we described the problem to him and he said that he will not fix it. this is the same guy, scott, who told me last time that he has never seen this kind of failure before. fortunately i found several other owners with the same problem and one who had it repaired at findlay kia sahara, were scott has never seen it before. i knew the way they treated me the first time today was coming, so i ll let some one else handle it from here. please stay away from this dealership, sales people are nice and i like the car. but service is were you spend most of your time and the men i have had contact with are not professionals."
480,negative,"so i called them after reading this yelp review about how they gave this person a loaner car ( though she had no work done ) as a way to help her. i called to ask if they could look at my car cause the check engine light was on ...owner rick said no one could actually work on it until monday . that's fine but i work and so i asked about the loaner cars and he went out of his way to list all the requirements for the loaner car as in you had to have 300 bucks of work done .
dear rick my current shop has a fleet of loaner cars . they are older cars which they fix and maintain in awesome shape and their only requirement is that be a repair that takes some time to do . how is a person going to agree to using your car and therefore accepting at least 300 worth of charges .  i suggest you have this other yelp review removed it's misleading about how helpful you are . i was looking to pay for repairs and our family only has one car ."
481,negative,"i've been taking my car to sears auto center at metrocenter for routine maintenance for a few years. the employees are a bit rough around the edges but overall pleasant. when my car's check engine light came on and began to run a little sluggish, my first instinct was to get a hold of the place i knew best when it came to cars. after charging me $80 to do a simple inspection of my car, they handed me a quote that totaled higher than the kbb value of my car. i was informed both catalytic converters were a road hazard and could ignite at any moment, the spark plugs were all burnt out, the o2 sensors failed, the timing belt was about to snap, the head gasket was leaking oil, it was time for an oil change, and there was not one but multiple check engine light codes for all of this. the clerk, trying to remain pleasant, exclaimed ""looks like your car needs a little tlc!"" haha, good one!
afraid to even drive the car at this point, i took the day off work and called around auto shops in the valley to see if they'd do the work for a better price. i decided to just check the price of the most expensive repair, the catalytic converters for now, and worry about the other stuff later. i was quoted half the price at literally every place i called. i eventually got ahold of someone who would look at my car for free. (if you're curious about who i visited, see my other reviews!) when i arrived at his shop, he looked at our car carefully and attentively and explained what he saw was wrong with our car. a few spark plugs and the head gasket and explained he saw no evidence for the rest of the issues.  he then checked the check engine light codes and showed me right there that was only 1 cylinder misfire code, cleared it and  instructed me to replace the spark plugs and see how it ran for a while after that. i followed his instructions, along with changing the spark plugs, head gasket, and oil myself just to be cautious. (thanks to youtube!) also apparently their criteria for an expired timing belt is whether there's a sticker on it indicating when it was last replaced, not actually looking at it and asking the customer if they've replaced it. 
six months after this overwhelming experience, my car was completely fine. surprise! however, i got a flat on my tire. because i had them put on by sears, i decided to go back and see if they'd patch it. they did! so they earned their one star. i also got to talk to a lovely lady in the waiting area about her car that was being repaired. apparently she took it in before a big road trip and didn't really notice anything wrong with it and just came in for an inspection. so why was she waiting? what do you think was wrong with it? you guessed it, everything! 
it's been a year since the incident and my car has been operating consistently. 
my verdict? if you just need an oil or tire change and a spare 2 hours to burn, go to sears. if you've got a mechanical problem, go see a mechanic."
482,negative,"this place is an absolute rip off and scam artist, my mom has spent over $1300 to get her car fixed and all they're doing is throwing parts at it. 
2 oxygen sensors and 2 catalytic converters later the check engine light is still on! they're saying she needs to replace the 3rd one. a proper mechanic would've diagnosed that instead of just randomly throwing parts at it and hoping that it was fixed. 
since it got back from getting the second catalytic converter replaced it's had a major exhaust leak and sounds like a truck.
went into the shop to see what was going on, as this is getting ridiculous and they're taking advantage of her. we asked to have the old catalytic converters back, as they probably weren't bad in the first place since we are still getting the same code and they're nowhere in site. 

do not trust this place with your vehicle. they're highly unprofessional. when we brought it back for the fifth time, it was there two days and they didn't even call. when my mom called to find out what was going on they said it's the third one and demanded more money. 
shouldn't have to pay more money for something that should've been fixed the first time. 
we will be talking to a lawyer if this doesn't get resolved."
483,negative,i bought a car from here a little over a month ago and has been nothing but problems with it. took it to one mechanic to fix the check engine light and said that it was 1100 dollars to fix a catalytic converter. so we called the warranty company to fix the issue and they refused and said it was over the miles for them to fix it and we bought the extended warranty. so we then called drivetime to help address the issue and they agreed since we bought it not that long ago but we would have to pay the 100 dollar deductible. so ok we agreed to that and the mechanic facility were it was had the part was eager to get it done. then the silver state(the warranty company) called the mechanic and told them not to do anything. we were then told we had to move it to another repair facility. we then did and had to wait another week for the part to get to the new shop. it gets there on the 21 of june and they fix it (supposedly). they tell us we can come pick up the car pay the deductible and go. so we did and we are having the same issue has it was when we started all of this. now drivetime wants us to take it back the mechanic for them to do what nothing again and pay the 100 dollars. do your job right the first time now come on this is getting old. but let's see how this gets played out dam.  ps i am frustrated from all of this and it seems like they sold us a lemon.
484,negative,"okay, so the staff here are very friendly and seem to really want to help. 
with that being said, you will never see me return here; they just don't seem to know what they're doing.
the guy who worked on my car, i believe his name is chris, told me it was fixed, i come down to the shop, drive off and not even 200 ft and my vehicle exhibits the same exact problem i brought it in for. they look confused and take my car back to ""look at the tranny fluid"" after i've already payed $140 for them to ""fix it"", and this is where it gets good. chris says ""i don't know how to put this, but your transmission is fucked."" i get sad, ask how much ($1,500+) and he proceeds to tell me to come back monday (it was friday). so, i'm carless over the weekend cause they couldn't fix my car. i end up going to boulder highway and gibson to delta auto care who say my starter is shot and actually fix my car for $875. they tell me my transmission is fine and my car runs great.
i wont ever be going back here to usa auto service."
485,negative,"on july 13th my battery died at work and bell was the closest dealership to my work. i went over and they were able to put the new battery in no issues. within a week or so i noticed my transmission didn't sound right. i have always dealt with earnhardt so i booked my appointment with them, they were booked so i didn't get an appointment until 8-2. well today i got a call from my service advisor saying that when i got my battery replaced a hose broke and to fix it would be about $105. i let them know that i actually had my battery replaced at bell ford, so earnhardt reached out to bell to let them know what was going on and bell declined to help. earnhardt without any question told me not to worry about it and they would be able to cover the cost and my rental. if it wasn't for earnhardt doing the right thing today, i would have been out another $130. i would have thought bell would stand by their work but i guess not. so now i would rather drive an hour out of my way to another dealership that will actually help me and stand by their work. be cautious when dealing with their service center, it truly feels like it was done on purpose to make me come back and spend more money with that."
486,negative,"i seriously have not had this bad service in a dealership ever i bought a non bmw vehicle (chevy camaro) obviously it was used chip rogers was the sales person that sold me the vehicle at the time he was nice and etc. but when a check engine light came on it was difficult to get a hold of him and when i would he would say take the car to chevy. i than had to be directed to taylor the pre own car manager or something similar to it. he was nice and told me the check engine light was getting worked on etc. when i went to pick up the car which took for ever the car wasn't even there another sales men drove me to another dealership auto nation to pick it up by this point my experience was bad yet i didn't mind much because the car was ""fix"" not until one week later the check engine light comes on and chip, taylor and the general manager keep avoiding my calls smh bmw of las vegas i do not recommend no one to this shitty service by far the worst dealership experience ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (they don't even deserve 1 star)!"
487,negative,"the service department has always put on the great customer service face.  they are accommodating and and easy to communicate with.

the only problem is that the actually technicians do not care about your car.  i have had several experiences where the technicians will break items within my car internally and try to cover it up (and sometimes not).

worse then that, when i had mechanical trouble with the clutch, one of the technicians told me there was nothing wrong with the car despite the fact that he couldn't even get the car in gear.  it was a blown master cylinder  which was covered under warranty, but i shouldn't have had to fight with the guy when there was an obvious problem.

turns out that he ended up putting the wrong fluid into the transmission after he completed the work which then cause a string of other problems.  

the devil in the details, and the problem really is that the details aren't being paid attention to."
488,negative,"i bought a car from drive time and it immediately started showing problems. the check engine light just ""magically"" came on while i was driving home from the dealership that day. the sales agent had the nerve to tell me that he was insulted that i would imply that drive time would shut the check engine light off just to sell a car.. every car i drove after that had issues. either the breaks were grinding, the steering was bad, or it made weird noises in the engine area. drive time is trying to sell cars that aren't even worth $1500 for $9000-$11000. really? and by the time you pay off your car you've paid $20,000 for it after interest.. this place is a rip off, and when you aren't completely satisfied with the car you're test driving and want to see other cars, they get annoyed with you as if you should just settle for any crappy car they have on the lot. if i am going to sell my soul to you people, it better be worth it. don't go to drive time for a car. you'll be better off taking the bus."
489,negative,"let me preface this with the fact that i wanted to like this place because i am getting too old to do my own repairs and i don't desire to do a clutch or subframe bushing job in my garage. so, at the recommendation of an alex faithful i gave him a call. i was reassured multiple times that everything would go as planned so i agreed to drop the car off for a job that was well over $1k in labor alone. when i called to check on the car's progress i discovered that he had done a differential fluid change after i told him that i no longer needed it done (before even taking the car in). i had just done it myself, a month prior. turns out that he was using an old email as his scope of work, despite my call to confirm the scope the day before i dropped the car off. when i got there to pay, he was going to charge me for it. we worked that out so we are ok there, but it shouldn't have even been on the bill.

fast forward to a day later when i noticed a clunking coming from underneath the car. the noise sounded familiar because i had just resolved that issue by replacing the exhaust hanger bushings on the car right before it went to alex for the clutch and subframe bushings. when i finally got time to get under the car and see if the exhaust just needed adjustment, i noticed a rather startling thing. the brand new red bushings that i had just installed were gone and, in their place, were used/cracked/worn black bushings (pic). i was livid. after i calmed down and ran all possible scenarios as to why that would have happened i emailed alex and asked him about it (in a very respectful manner). i included pictures and let him know that i had just installed the red bushings before the service to cure the exhaust clunking on the support brace, due to old bushings collapsing on themselves. he called me a few days later and nicely told me that there is no reason for him to remove them and i was sol... really? from our conversation, the most he was willing to do was adjust the current bushings to see if that fixed the clunking. not even willing to entertain the idea that the bushings may have been misplaced, broken or to look around the shop or ask his shop assistant about them.

so, let me get this straight; i just paid you a huge sum of money (that was not subjected to credit card fees either, so even more net $$) and you won't even investigate the possibility of the customer being right? i have receipts and records for them being purchased and installed, as well as the old parts sitting on my desk; the burden of proof is not on me at this point. i have decided to replace these, again, on my own dollar and move on from this. sadly for you, alex, the bmwcca members that regularly approach me for recommendations will be sent elsewhere and you won't be doing my thermostat job, nor anything else for me. i have also redacted my recommendations already made to other individuals before this situation developed.

to make matters worse, i developed a nasty vibration/buzzing shortly after the conversation, so back under the car i went to discover that both bolts within the exhaust brace, where it connects to the transmission housing, were halfway backed out (pic). i also found that the cabin air filter housing had been handled without care and broken (pic) as well as the cabin air filter reinstalled upside down (pic; there are clearly labeled arrows on the filter) during the clutch bleeding. i also re-bled the clutch as there was air in the system that caused pedal inconsistency.

bottom line; i looked to you to do the right thing (as i am told that you are a very honest individual) and you just washed your hands of it and walked away. i am a very reasonable and friendly person and i am particular about my cars and the quality of work that goes into them. i expected much more from you and, sadly, i was let down over less than $40 in retail parts and sloppy issues. it is the service and integrity that makes the difference and i hope that my experience was the outlier.

consumers, please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to discuss my experience further (i've documented everything).

3/16/2016 update: i would like to report additional details on this experience. as the new clutch wore-in and i drove the car more and more i noticed that the clutch pedal developed a rather odd springback and notchiness. so, under the dash i went to check components. everything looked ok so under the car i went, where i found that the slave cylinder had been reinstalled with the pushrod cocked slightly which caused it to actuate in a non-linear fashion. i also noticed that the pushrod had been greased (that's a no-no). once i cleaned it up, lubed the tip only and reinstalled, the clutch performs as it should. unfortunately, the damage has already been done to my slave cylinder (sratches/gouging in the pushrod) from actuating off-axis. this now needs to be replaced and that also requires the master cylinder to be done. heed my advice...beware!"
490,negative,"worst customer service experience of my life. i take the car first thing on a thursday morning for a check engine light which i'd already had diagnosed. had to pay for a rental from enterprise down the street because they have no loaners (even if you're under warranty). get a call later that day saying that since i had my last oil change at valvoline, ""it's possible"" that the wrong weight of oil was used, and that they won't proceed on the  (completely unrelated) repair until they do an oil change (for $80 plus tax, even though this repair was under warranty). at that point i told them to go ahead, as i was pretty much stuck and just wanted the repair done. clearly a money grab by the dealer. fast forward through several days of unanswered calls, no communication, and useless apologies. i never received an update from the service advisor unless i called, left a voicemail, and waited for a call back. a week after i had first taken the car, it was finally completed. after giving me the runaround this whole time, they still had the nerve to ask me to pay for the unnecessary oil change that in no way solved the problem. i had already paid for a day of rental and wasn't giving them another cent. to top it off, it's now a week after i picked up the vehicle, and the check engine light is back on. avoid this place at all costs."
491,negative,"had an oil change scheduled a week in advance. sat and watched.. slowest oil change ever, didn't rotate tires as advised."
492,negative,"we visited this dealership to investigate/purchase a 2014 jeep grand cherokee. the first time, we went on a test drive with a saleswoman (i don't remember her name) and we decided to not buy from her because she didn't even know the product she was trying to sell. she knew nothing about the engine or transmission of the vehicle.

we went back a month later, giving the place a second try using a different salesman. we ended up buying a grand cherokee from michael. he was very nice and knowledgeable throughout the entire purchasing process.

here's where the experience goes bad. after-the-sale interactions with michael were full of unfulfilled promises and excuses. it's the typical feeling of they now have your money so all customer service is thrown out the window. he lied to us about the availability of ordered items. i wish car salesmen would quit perpetuating car salesmen stereotypes. classic bait-and-switch of great customer service before/during the sale but bad customer service after the sale.

our next jeep will be purchased elsewhere."
493,negative,buyer beware if you look at the reviews on there web site all 5 star reading the reviews on yelp way more accurate. they are great selling you the car after you have bought it omg service is the worst. bought a 2013 honda from them and purchased the extended warranty less then 4000 miles later have transmission issues i purchased the car for my daughter who is in college and wanted coverage just in case something happened they assured me if any thing happened she could take it anywhere (dealership) to have the problem corrected. that was a joke now they wont return my calls. i could go on and on with the problems i have had with them this place does not even deserve the 1 star rating the other reviews are correct save yourself the grief buy somewhere else
494,negative,"i had always heard great things about this place in the past, so, when my check engine light came on, i took it to them . big mistake!! they over charged me to replace a tiny part, plus $79 just to check the diagnostic code (which auto zone does for free btw) and it didn't fix the problem! so i took it back thinking they'd fix it, but the guy who i think was the owner, was a complete jerk, so was the receptionist. no customer service skills at all. i took it down the street to franz who charged me way less and were really nice while they were at it. bottom line is i created a yelp account specifically to write this review, that's how bad this place is."
495,negative,"i took my nissan xterra, which was purchased from another dealer less than a year ago and in good condition to this location to get the routine service performed at 120,000 miles and to fix an oil leak, i signed an estimate saying the total for both items would be around 700.00. a few hours later, while i was at work, i received text messages saying that my car was in horrible condition and that it needed 4,000.00 worth of extra work beyond the 700.00. i told them to cease everything and i would be in to pick up my car after i got off work. when i went to get my car, the associate told me i could not have my car because it was taken apart to be fixed...which puzzled me because i told them earlier to forget everything and i just wanted my car back. that associate was also very rude and offended both me and my boyfriend. as i was leaving the lot, i noticed my car was not taken apart, it was in the parking lot. very angry at this point because now i feel like i am being taken advantage of and lied to, i called the service manager in the morning and explained to him how upset i was and that i just wanted my car back. he was extememly rude to me, even though he did admit my car wasn't taken apart and according to him it was just a ""communication error"". he was not helpful at all and very defensive. later on that day i started receiveing text messages and calls from one of the service associates, basically harrassing me, telling me to call back the service manager and tell him it was all his fault and not the other guys fault. hardly professional, and when i again called to further complain about this matter to the service manager he was again rude and of no help at all. i picked up my car and was charged 680.00 for basically nothing- transmission conditioner, balance and rotate tires, oil change, air filter and battery check. all of which would've cost 200.00 or less anywhere else. i am actually not even sure they did anything the 680.00 was supposed to do because my car still shakes as if the tires have not been balanced or rotated. they wouldn't let me take my car unless i paid so i just wanted to be rid of this headache and get my car back, so i was forced to pay money for services i believe i did not even recieve and even if i did a total rip off and taking advantage of a female who doesn't know much about cars. and as a side note- what they wanted 4,000.00 for i was quoted from another certified mechanic that i would only be charged 650.00 for from that mechanic. 
do not take your car here, they take advantage of women and over-charge for services."
496,negative,"my vehicle was taken to this bmw dealership mechanic shop where it was damaged during the recall fix/ diagnostic inspection. went from 400 fix to 2500
on march 05, 2018 i went to the dealership due to recall 51 24 17 for door latch repair. i explained to the rep at the dealership that the car had some other issues. i told him i took the car to auto zone and had them use the code reader to determine why my check engine light was on. i was given code p2187, and i changed other parts that would be considered the cause if the issue with no avail. i told him i just needed a smoke test done and he said it would be about $170 i gave them the keys and guss martinez said he'd give me a call when it was done. when i returned to pick up my car there was an issue with my door that needed to be fixed in addition to the recall which was created also during the fix. guss said that he ordered the part and the mechanic said that he would fix the issue the following day. while we talked about that i also asked questions about what they found during inspection and the mechanic said that the leak was coming from some grommets that came out either loose or bad and that he in an attempt to try to quick fix the issue as a courtesy, ""which i appreciated at the time"", he said he torqued the bolts to tighten them more thinking maybe that was the cause; the bolts not being tightened enough. next day they fixed the issue with he door and everything with that was fine. now to bring it up to the current day, i took my car to a shop for the repair which was recommended during consultation and to my suprise i was told that my valve covers were cracked in two places, which were the same two places he said he tightened because of the air leak finding during the diagnostic/smoke test. the valve covers were $1000 for both and the labor to repair this issue would be 600 not including anything i brought the car there for initially. plus there was a broken valvetronic shaft sensor which cost $281 that was broken during the removal of the cover that they didn't mention in the estimate at all from bmw. ive tried to reach josh martinez who is the manager at the w sahara bmw as well as gustavo martinez who was the service advisor there. i spoke with someone who was there to answer the phones who said before transferring me to guss for assistance that ""he knows with bmw's the valve covers crack"" but that he would transfer me to guss voicemail if he was not available at the time. didn't know if he meant bmw vehicles in general had a common issue of them just cracking or if you attempted to rectify an issue around that area you risk cracking them, but thats what he said. so that also concerned me if they knew that it was a possibility that it would get cracked why do what was done to it and risk it. unless it was created to force the repair that wasn't necessary from the beginning. oh yeah and also i spoke with the gm eric, and he said the same thing josh martinez said that i was lying cause the mechanics had no reason to try to help me cause it wouldn't benefit them. so basically if something happens to your car with service cause i can only speak for that which i've witnessed, if anything happens it's there word against yours and they will not be empathetic in the least. oh and they told me there was nowhere to tighten, smh i didn't even bother giving that a response. but if you have a bmw and need service speak to gary at royal auto off reno ave... trust me my car is already fixed. gave them the ok and in a day it was done"

ps- i'm sorry i called you a xxxxx but you kinda were...."
498,negative,"joe, the sarcastic scammer behind the counter failed to inform me of an automatic fail if the check engine light is on for an emissions test. 5 minutes after taking the car in he comes back and says the car failed and gives me a bill for $48. when i asked what's wrong, he said the check engine light was on. i then asked if he connected the vehicle to the emissions machine and he said no. $48 for a mechanic to start the car and see the check engine light on is asinine. this place is a complete joke. if you want to get scammed, make sure you go here! he could have easily informed me of the auto-fail if the light is on. instead, he chose to make a quick $50 to lose a customer for life. good job joe! they look for any way to make an extra buck. i'm surprised this place hasn't shut down yet."
499,negative,"if i could give a 0 star i would, i bought a nissan altima july 8th by july 14th it was brought in for transmission, they claim they were gonna fix it they sent it out for over 2 weeks when i got it back its worse. here we r ive had the car a week and a half and its back cause the car isnt even driveable i spent 6 grand all the money i had for it and its been out of my posession for 3 weeks. ive put 80 miles on the car and as of.today they r giving issues saying it will never b fixed as per james the general manager. all i want is my money back. he said only way to trade it in is to put another 2 to.3 grand into it and ill already lose 1300 in taxes... they r croocks dont go there ever!!!!!! i now have a lawyer, channel 8,5,13, better bus bureau, and dmv compliance involved. when i buy a car from a dealer i expect kt to run. an older car will have issues but not transmission as soon as u take it home."
500,negative,the worst service ever paid money to get my car fixed and extra to get my check engine light off still have my light on and my problem was never resolved completely took advantage my family and i have been with chevy for over 20 years i have to say after this car i'll never purchase with them again !!!!
501,negative,"i purchased my rv in february 2016 and took out of state delivery in california.  the title process was terrible...it took almost four months to get clear title despite paying cash at the dealership.  

there were a few issues noted before we left that lot that the owner and salesman said they would take care (some of which they put in writing), some issues were not disclosed...that would have caused us to either walk away or negotiate a better deal.  two significant issues, the check engine light kept coming on (not disclosed until the delivery driver told us in ca, after we signed the papers) and the fuel gauge would drop to empty.  minor issues like the slide toppers were supposed to be replaced and were either not replaced or missing.  

the owner seemed like he genuinely wanted to help and would make things right...but then stopped returning calls or trying to help. i even offered to drive back to az and again, no return call.  i truly thought that they would be decent to deal with...but their actions were quite the opposite."
502,negative,"i don't normally write reviews but i came here for a simple oil change and they totally f'd my car up! my girlfriend did it for me while i was at work and i get off work to find out my car is over heating all kinds of lights on the dashboard are going off. we go back up there and a girl who works there said this happened to her chevy cruze around 140,000 miles. that was the biggest load of bs i ever heard! my check engine light was never on till i went there and i left and it's still on. i shouldn't go for a simple oil change and worry about my car blowing up!"
503,negative,"i give fairway a one star because of the service department. the staff is polite, and the free shuttle is also nice, but would be better if they gave you a ride back as well. the reason for the low rating is because i was given an estimate of $150 - $200. now we are all use to service centers charging the high end of an estimate, that alone sucks, but i was charged 40% above the high mark of the estimate. $240. when i explained that it should not be above the estimate to one of the service ladies, and i told her about being charged $60 less than an estimate by a muffler shop, her response was that i saved it there so this balances out. i don't think so. i should have refused to pay the extra $40, but was not in the mood to argue. maybe i will call the manager tomorrow. i will not be going back there unless they call and apologize."
504,negative,"it really is unfortunate that i have to give this store 1 star. first and foremost, let me thank arturo. he helped me with all questions regarding my brakes, transmission etc. he even changed my battery for me. my issue comes at the end of my transaction. one of the managers (a heavy set caucasian guy, looks like a juggalo without the make up, his name is walter supposedly) was tasked with ringing me up. when i thanked arturo, this manager said to me, ""you don't have to roll your r's when you say his name."" this refers to the fact that latinos, like myself, put emphasis on the r parts of names. i found this very offensive and not the type of thing you say to a customer. this manager kept going, saying, ""arturo doesn't know what he's talking about and i'm surprised he helped you at all."" this was said jokingly, but it is still very unprofessional. in a business based on expertise, why would anyone joke about something like this?! if he is this disrespectful to customers, i feel really bad for the latinos on his crew, including arturo and the other young latina female that was there. i've never been so happy with service yet so offended at the same time. nice to know some people have no respect for other cultures."
505,negative,"the only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is because the sales department is actually pretty good.  i took my chevy suburban to a local shop due to transmission issues on a brand new transmission we purchased through van chevrolet which came in from gm in michigan. the day it was installed, it had issues. 

since it came with a warranty, a few days later we were still having problems so the shop who did the work called van chevy on wednesday morning to ask if they could get it in to take a look. they said, no sorry we are too busy today but let's set an appointment for tomorrow, so we scheduled 7am thursday. i dropped it off at 7am, by about 2pm i was wondering how they were doing, i called and they said they had not even looked at it yet. 

i was very upset, 7 hours and no one had touched it? i told them i was coming to pick it up, i couldn't be without it over the weekend so i picked it up. i called the next day to talk to rick stubbs, the service director who was very impolite, combative, and downright rude the entire time on the phone. he made up some excuses saying it's like a dr. office, you make an appointment but you don't get in right away....yeah, but i don't wait 7 hours either. he said if i brought it in on monday 7am, he'd get someone on it right away. 

i bring it in monday, he wasn't much more pleasant in person, an hour or two later he calls to say it's internal transmission issues, they have to order a new one from gm in michigan...again. i go without my truck until friday, we went in to renew our loaner car paperwork around 10am, the service writer was asked if the tranny had arrived, she checked and came back and said ""yes it arrived this morning."" we asked, are they working on it? she said no, not yet. we asked when will they be, she said ""i don't know, i'm too busy, they might not get to it today, they aren't here tomorrow, and we are closed sunday and the holiday monday. 

so i called over around 2pm once i heard this story from my wife after i got off the plane from out of town, talked to the service writer, expressed my displeasure, so she went to check. comes back, oh they are done, they are test driving it now.  how does she not know what's going on?

when they have my car from monday through friday and knew when the tranny was arriving, how could they not plan to have someone start working on it immediately? if they would have looked at it for the short time it took to diagnose the problem when we first had it in there the previous thursday, i could have saved myself 6 days in getting it repaired.

overall terrible experience, i will never get any of my chevy's serviced at van chevrolet again (i just bought a different brand new one there 11 months ago as well). i am also researching a new car right now and a chevy is top on the list, too bad for their sales department, their service department ruined any chance of me buying from them again.  their sales department as actually pretty good."
506,negative,"bought a certified 2014 honda pilot from "" autonation honda"" this was the first time i needed service since i purchasing. i had bad experience with a person that i was paired with (  candace) . i bought a used car with 24x miles on it since it was a used car i brought with all the extra warranties to cover if anything happens to it. she asked me have i done 30k miles service i told her no i brought this pilot with 24k miles  this is my 1st oil change. she told me "" i will look into this"" and called me to let me know. i got a texted from her and it said all i need is transmission fluid $109. i got her text next day said it's ready to pick up at "" cashiers on the express side"" i went in there cashiers told me go to other side with double door to pick up from there very bad communication. after i sign off and paid my service i requested to speak with candace about my car waiting almost 5 mins she didn't show up. i left with disappointed.  

i thought who ever check you in and will check you out. unfortunately that not happen to me. 

i not sure  if i want to bring my pilot to this dealership in the future for service or even buy any car's from autonation honda chandler."
507,negative,"as i was driving down the interstate passing through vegas, it felt like my transmission ""slipped"", so i pulled over and had it towed into honda west. when i brought it into the shop, i told them my concerns - a small leak and the slipping of what i believed to be the transmission. 

the advisor (carol - who was very nice) told me that i needed to replace my transmission and it would cost $5,000. this was very hard to believe because i never had a problem in the past with it, and it ran perfectly fine. i pulled over shortly after the slipping to prevent any further damage. 

i decided to do some research and reached out to another mechanic (hondoctors). i took my vehicle there, and they were able to find the issue quickly. there was a small leak, which he tightened up. next, he gave me a transmission flush. i walked out paying roughly $200, and my car runs great now. the mechanic there said my transmission was perfectly fine.

i did reach out to honda west to get a refund (which they eventually agreed to do) for the mis-diagnosis. luckily i did some research and took it elsewhere, saving about $4,800."
508,negative,"i went to fairway chevrolet to get my truck checked.  i was on vacation when my trucks check engine light came on and it wouldn't accelerate past 20 mph.  i made an appointment for service and when i showed up they told me that they couldn't help me for another two days!  i told them that i was leaving the next day and that wasn't an option.  i asked why they couldn't take the vehicle in and the service guy told me they were busy.  i asked him if he could at least plug the truck into a computer so we could see why the check engine light was on and he said that all the computer would do is give him an error code and they would not know what the error code was!  he also told me that i wouldn't find a dealership in las vegas that would service my truck during the summer.  could you imagine the look on my face when he gave me that answer!  i have never heard of a dealer run service department that can't read an error code.  to say that these individuals are incompetent would be a huge disservice to incompetent people! i am a die hard chevy guy and am very mechanically inclined and i would not ever think to give someone else the answer that this guy gave me!  my next step is to get a hold of a higher echelon and lodge a formal complaint.  i advise that the fleet manager or even the owner,  really pay attention to who they have working in service as they may be the downfall to their operation."
509,negative,"service department: not even one star worth

i towed in my oddysey with a/c acting weird with lots of noises and smoke.  i did not know it was ac problem.  i took the video of noise and showed them.  kathy parman the customer advisor had me do transmission flush, power steering flush.  but when the service was completed and the problem continued on the way out of the honda parking lot, their mechanic frank saw my video and immediately concluded it is ac issue.  then this kathy informed me that i have to wait ""a few days"" for authorization for repair.  i had bumper to bumper extended warantee and they knew i was from out of town.  when i challenged her which part of the service warranty contract says that waiting time or pre-authorization, she turned hostile and told me that it is my contract and i should know better and eventually avoided answering my question.  in fact, i had the entire contract with me at the time and knew it was not true.  the pre-authorization is only required, according to the contract page 1, when you need to repair other repair shop than honda dealer.  next morning i called and spoke with the service manager brian haffey.  he again stated that any over $500.00 warranty covered repair must be pre-authorized, therefore, practically refusing any large and important emergency repair under warranty.  if that is true, this brian guy, in saving a few dollars on repair cost, opened up a lot of controvercy over the extended warranty.  who would buy the honda extended warranty if this attitude is justified? 

how i took care of my repair
since they practically refused the service, i went back to my hometown and took a big risk on the 6 hours trip   with entire my family.  luckly servived the return trip.  my san diego honda dealer mechanic saw the same video and smelled the freon gas and immediately and very confidently took my car under warranty.  that was easy and that was the service.  according to the mechanic, the problem was something to do with a/c relay, blocking pathway.  getting hot and expanding, the safety system kicks in and relaese the preasure, thus the noise and smoke.

how to fight this injustice at honda west dealer
the best thing would be simply avoid this deslership.  but, if you cannot do that, there are several things you can do.  the honda service contract allows the arbitration.  this is a third party arbitration and the final conclusion is just the same as the court judgement.  you can document your claim and send it to the address to honda care.  address is inside the contract.

also, you can claim your cost during time of delay, if the repair is a covered repair.  in my case, now i proved it as a covred repair, i can claim 1 or 2 day travel cost such as car rental, hotel, meals.  

follow up with honda care.  honda west refusing or delay in service is a breach of contract.  in worst case, honda care needs to refund you the $2,000.00 warranty original charge.  this case will be against the honda care.  

technically you can skip the arbitration and go to small claim directly if you have time.  honda care and honda west are 2 different companies.  if you want to file lawsuit directly against the honda west, which is easier in process and collecting judgement, it has to be about their neglegence and breach of contract.  later i cam tslk about the small claim process in detail.

in conclusion, the honda west service team twist their policy to their liking and you must avoid them if possible but if you cannot, you must fight for your right."
510,negative,"their 2.5 star review says it all. please do yourself a favor! do not come to this dealership unless you want to be ripped off and have your vehicle in worse condition leaving than coming in. take your honda to findlay honda on azure dr. ..........i'll save some time and just get straight to the point. the car was at the dealership because of a recall but while driving there the check engine light came on so my dad had them check it out. they said it was a misfire due to a bad hydraulic tensioner. they ended up replacing it along with the timing belt and charged $1100. they said everything was inspected and it's perfect now. fast forward 6 days and the check engine light came back one. he took it back to honda west and they said it was another timing issue and needed a valve adjustment. this time we had to hand over another $450. the service adviser tried to explain the services charges, but i feel she had no idea what was going on. she was only regurgitating whatever information she got form the mechanic. 
my suspicions of their technical qualifications was confirmed when a gentleman next to me brought his car back in because the technician forgot to put the oil cap back on after doing a simple oil change. from now on we will be going to findlay honda on azure dr."
511,negative,"call me a fool but i have been going to this place for about a year.  i started going there because they had good deals on oil changes and the staff seemed pretty friendly.  well management has changed twice in a year and it's gone completely down hill.  

every time you go they do an inspection on your vehicle which seemed pretty harmless at first.  in fact it seemed like an added bonus because their the ""experts"" right, and they can see thing we don't notice?  wrong!  every time i went they found something!

i spent $260 on a transmission sensor and gasket change, then the very next time i went they said i needed my water pump changed.  they quoted me one price, but while i was at home waiting for my car they called and told me that my thermostat was bad and it would cost more to fix.  they tried changing it but then said the car was overheating so they put the old one back in (i guess is wasn't bad after all).  the cost for that repair was about $450.

my car has been running fine, but today i went in for am oil change and they said i have a leak from my water pump!  again!!??  no way!  to make things worse the new set of staff members are beyond rude and instead of talking the guy prefers to point at the paper and ask ""what does that say""?  

i will never ever go back and i would not recommend this place to anyone.  steer clear, they are rip offs and very rude!"
512,negative,"went here for an oil change this afternoon.. as i was driving home this evening the check engine light went on. my dealership where i bought the car said that the check engine light went on because of a ""half-a###ed"" job of an oil change.the filter wasn't installed correctly and oil spurted all over the engine. luckily the dealership fixed the poor job by vavoline.i had to pay another $58.00 on top of the $89.00 i paid vavoline for the oil change and tire rotation. worst experience i ever had with a place like this."
513,negative,everyone beware i just found out the transmission flush they charged me for was never done. beware of this place i still have to go back and bring this issue to their attention so i will post an update after i am done.
514,negative,"i went here because my water pump needed to be replaced, biggest mistake. after they did the work i picked my car up i noticed my check engine light was on. i asked tony the manager why it was on, he informed me that it would go off in a day or so and not to worry. so i waited a couple days and still the check engine light didnt go off and my car smelt like gas really bad. so i went back to them and tony told me i needed my o2 sensors replaced and a new fuel pump. so i had my fuel pump replaced by a different shop and wanted to wait to fix my o2 sensors. well one of my friends replaced two of the sensors and cleaned out the other two, and the check engine light still wouldnt go off. so he told me i should get a diagnostic ran to find out what was going on so i did. i was informed that a the fuse that controls the sensors was missing and if that fuse is taken out it will turn your check engine light on. they will scam you so bad... might give you a good deal on the first job then mess up your car so you come back to them. plus tony the manager admited to having bad people work for him and he had to fire them but he's the one thats in on it.
dont take your car here you will regret it!!!!!"
515,negative,"went in for a simple oil change and of course after everything was done they seemed to find something wrong with my vehicle from transmission fluid, tires, and brakes. my car is still brand new (less than 20k)  and still runs well so i know everything seemed bogus. service guy (andy) seemed a little pushy that i needed to repair them right away. from $20 oil change they wanted almost $500 in repairs. next time i'll take my car for service somewhere loyal."
516,negative,"service is fine.

i had called to come in for a new brakes  because i saw a deal for 100$ brake service special they had going on that normally goes for 150.  

i got an inspection and found out that i needed new rotors brakes and, oils? $100 service is now $770. i asked if the brake special was included and he said yes.  ok cool...that's fine. 

they assured me that i won't have issues after that and i believe them.  

the reason for the 3 star review is for not honoring their special. after i looked over the bill i asked shawn if the special was included in the bill.  he had no idea what i was talking about so i showed him the coupon online and the coupon i had on hand. he informed me that the brakes that are used in the special are very cheap brakes and wear down rather quickly. instead he used ceramic brakes on my car which are more expensive but much better...gee thanks but i did not ask for that.

if he had known that that was the special i was talking about he would've told me that he ordered the ceramic quality breaks. he apparently gave me a discount on these brakes so that is why they came out to be 150 not 200...no where on the bill did this ""discount"" apply so for all i know he was just trying to get me to accept the price...which i did because i was tired and wanted to just leave. 

i guess what i want people to get out of this review is that if you're planning to come in for the brake special..don't. regardless of what brakes were used....i feel ripped off. it wasn't much $ considering what the bill was but i won't be back. i'm glad that i know now that goodyear places poor quality brakes into your vehicles if you use a special that they offer. shady business.

** i was offered a 20$ discount on my next visit to change my transmission fluid as an apology for the mix up.  

thank you but no thank you."
517,negative,"i went to them, because my company get a discount from them. problem number 1. i just had my transmission fluid replaced by then and 3 months later they told me i needed to replace it. i told them that i just had it replaced and that it doesn't need to be changed every 3 months. problem number 2. i got all new tires, a week later my tire blew as it was pinched (got a second opinion) and it was put on wrong. the guy at big o told me that i hit something. i explained to him that i did not hit anything while i was driving. he continue to disagree with me. since i did not buy insurance they made me buy a new tire. i then got a call stating that they would not replace my tire since the rim was bent and the guy said it was from me ""hitting something"". i went over there and looked at the rim and saw nothing. he told me that they were not going to replace the tire unless i bought a new rim. since was going out of town i just bought it. 

this place tries to up sell and they are absolutely horrible. being a girl they think that i know nothing about cars when i actually used to work on cars."
518,negative,"the longest lines in the history of car rentals! line was out the door and hertz had two people working the desk while chit chatting with each customer.  there were other desk people around that thought talking to each other and not helping customers was the way to operate a business. 

to top it off, the car i was given had a broken transmission and hertz had to have it towed away from my hotel. the second car they gave me had one brake light that was out and no washer fluid. 

i would advise going to a different rental agency."
519,negative,"we bought 2 cars from anthony peake last year. low key, no pressure and love the cars. manager a.m. is very pleasant also.
only reason i originally gave 4 stars is my poor experience with my 1st service. they changed the oil and i assumed rotated the tires as is customary in my thinking. they did not rotate tires so i had to wait again while they did. before driving away i asked if they top off the fluids on this service. i was told ""yes"" but in checking i discovered ""no"". i waited again as they topped off the coolant from it's ""l"" level to ""f"" level. same for the washer fluid. i then figured i should check the oil which was full. i simply have to trust they replaced the old oil filter. 
they did give me an overnight loner because it took siriusxm so long to answer questions about my having no data for fuel prices, movies, etc.. it was discovered that i don't subscribe to those services. however the loaner they gave me was empty of fuel with a range of just 21 miles so i immediately had to go to a gas station.
car electronics went haywire in nov. and car was towed along with a recall letter. another bad service experience and i later discovered they did not fix the problem and they did not give me a copy of their work order when they delivered the car. 
again in jan 2016, same problem, and the worse experience. lies after lies from service who apparently thought i was an idiot. called mon to arrange my towing the car to them. they gave me the 800# and tues i had the car towed to them. fri i called because i had heard nothing from them. car wasn't touched because they didn't know who's car it was (lie one). said tow truck driver didn't know either (lie two). i still have the tow driver's cell # because he called twice for directions, one hour later he supposedly delivers the car to s clt hyundai and does not know who it belongs to. i reminded them the vin# would tell them who's car it is. then they tell me they knew it was my car and called and left me a message (lie three). i have one number, my cell, no missed call or vm from them. they had the car two weeks while i drove my gas guzzling pick up. when they returned the car the again forgot to give me the work order from nov problem, so they mailed it. guess what, no mention of the recall letter repair from nov.
if they are convenient for you, go buy a car from anthony peake, then never show your face there again. try anyone else for service, trust me, save yourself aggravation and the lies practiced by experienced service professionals."
520,negative,"i don't hate the car i got but i will not be buying my next chally here for sure.. first off i pretty much guaranteed salesmen i'd be getting the car if the test drive went well. which it did, car drove well and that's what i urgently needed at the time. the car was a challenger with severe paint damage. didn't mind the paint damage. so night 1 same day i test drove it i make my purchase , but ridiculously i am not even allowed to drive the car home that night even though i live 50 minutes away because the staff needed leaves earlier than they close to release keys. so i drop the down payment. my placard date begins and i pay for a day of no car. i go home and return the next day to pick up the car. immediately after getting it i drive straight to a vinyl wrap store to get estimates.. he told me they sold me a lemon just because the paint job was so poor.. but that's not my issue. you'd be amazed this dealership sold me a vehicle with a stereo that did not turn on. i admit i should have checked but eager and more worried about sound of engine transmission struts and suspension​ i let it slip by. but again not a huge issue. but then calamity strikes, i bought this car to drive my girl to work because her car became unreliable at the time. so the first night i am tasked with driving her she gets in the passenger seats puts her seatbelt on and at the first stop sign i hit she get tossed forward into her seatbelt and with gentle acceleration swooped back. somehow i test drove this car with the salesmen who i rather not even name and he either did not notice or did not care that the car was literally unsafe. it pisses me off more that i had to leave it a day after buying it and it passed their "" inspection "" but these huge issues were over looked. re-cap after day 1 they had me return day 2 to pick up car. day 3 i have to return after realizing sound system has no sound and passenger seat slides around freely with no lock mechanism.. so i have to leave it over night. again needing to be driven around in my girlfriend's already strained vehicle. (50 minutes to/from) return day 4 stereo works and the seat gets a new locking mechanism. great, no gas even tho i've had to return daily since purchase. (mind you when i purchase it my girls car was on lot told a man there i'd be back 4am to get it he failed to tell me the lot gets locked down haha so i went there for nothing and had to return later that day again.) that's day 4, day 5 i wake up and i got a warning light on for airbags i think it was. whatever it was i had to return again just went that day because i wanted to get it over with. they did that for me someone knocked something loose in the passenger seat the previous day. 

so that's it. im done going there until i need paper to get registration. and they even messed this up. they give it to me and tell me i can do online registration. happy to avoid dmv i do it. but towbin dodge decided to right my homes street name but not put the address number so dmv mailed out plates to nowhere and they got returned. my first time doing online so i waited a long time and avoided driving my challenger since placard expired april 14th. week 6 when i heard my friend say his took 2 weeks i just went straight to dmv. i spent 5 hours at the dmv because the dealership error not only did it cost me my time but i got a $14 fee for the dealerships mistake. how pathetic for this to happen at a place probably managing millions and millions of dollars. i'm disgusted with the experience i had and almost regret not just immediately suing them for selling me a car that was unfit to sell and hurt my girlfriend. i highly recommend you buy your car somewhere else unless you like getting robbed of time and money. 5 star cars maybe but -5 star service. i was fooled by the fact a reality tv show was at this dealership so figured it would be legit. i was overly confident because of that so be weary.  

p. s. i asked for floor mats and i was denied them."
521,negative,"don't bother making an appointment. i was given an 11 am saturday appointment. i dropped my truck off at 10:50 am. all i wanted done is an oil change, rotate tires and wash. typically an hour. i dropped off my truck because i had things to do at the house i  can complete while my truck is done. well it's now 4:03 pm and my truck is still not completed. all i got from the service advisor is,"" did you see the line of cars we had this morning?"" that line of cars is not a me problem, that's a you problem. they set the appointment. i agreed to the appointment. i dropped my truck off early. i am still waiting. what a bunch of crap. well i have a surprise birthday party at 6 and i still have to clean myself up. i had to ditch all the other things i needed to do. now my wife has to add to her list of shit to do because i can't because san tan ford is unable to fulfill their end of the deal."
522,negative,"i have been coming to this dealership for the past 18 mos for standard maintenance.  my oil changes and audicare service intervals were done here without any problems.  i kind of thought i was valued because i always was greeted with a smile, they recognized me when i came in, made me feel secure in my choice to get service done on an expensive car at an honest dealership.  last month, i came in to get an oil change and also see why my check engine light came on, and while there, might as well figure out why i suddenly had a rather rough idle.  here's a summation of what happened: oil change done...$99 as expected.  check engine light was the result of ""cam shaft valve failure, $400 to replace.""  the idle?  well, that was the result of my engine mounts ""exploded, need replacement, $1,750.""  ummmm, ok.  i asked several questions as to the mechanics of these issues and each time my ""service consultant"" had to keep putting me on hold to relay each question and respective answer to the technician that worked on my car.  they had my car three days to figure out what was wrong, tell me i needed $2100 in repairs, and i never got a chance to even speak with the tech.  obviously i chose not to get the repairs done at that time, so i got whacked with a $140 diagnostic fee.  i came straight to yelp to find an audi specialist with high reviews.  who came out on top?  cars, certified auto repair specialists.  i'm going to write them a positive review right after this terrible review of audi henderson.  cars ran a diagnostic, took it for a test drive, switched out a sensor on an actuator, test drove it again, let it rest and cool, and test drove it again.  no check engine light, no motor mount issue, he checked.  i asked about the camshaft issue, his diagnostic codes came out as misfires and had nothing to do with the camshaft valve leaking.  he checked too. cost? free.  there was not $2100 worth of repairs under the hood.  do not go to audi of henderson, i was informed the technicians there are paid for the hours they bill, much like commission or lawyers.  i will now go to cars for all maintenance issues in regards to my audi.  the dealership can go suck it."
523,negative,"worst customer service ever!!  i went in and asked if they could check the transmission oil on my volvo.  i was told, ""we like to stay away from volvo's, mercedes and bmw's, but let me see"".  she then asked a mechanic who asked another mechanic.  after about 10 minutes, the first mechanic started working on a car and the 2nd mechanic got in his car and drove off!!!  the girl who worked there walked out and said, ""yeah sorry, we can't help you"".  i waited over 15 minutes to be told this!  not to mention there was only 1 car in the bay so it wasn't even busy.  never going back!"
524,negative,"let me just start by saying that i never write reviews but i set up an account just to write this. that is how awful the ride and experience was.

yesterday i used apache taxi to take a cab from sky harbor to my residence at the 101 and raintree. my drivers name was ali s****f (name only noted because he was the service provider and publicly posted in the cab) and he seemed alright when he picked me up but that was all that was okay. i got into the car and noticed that the dashboard of the vehicle was light up with errors like a christmas tree. i'm talking about the check engine light, brake light, washer fluid, everything. the info screen even was saying to service the airbags and tire pressure. this was greatly discerning.

now to the actual ride. we got onto the 101 north and immediately sped up to 100mph, but thinking about it that could have been broken too. it certainly felt like 90-100 since there wasn't anyone that was going to pass us. we were flying in the hov, steering wheel shimmying back and forth like crazy. he then saw an officer in the area of talking stick and slammed on the brakes. i even felt my luggage that was in the trunk slam into back of the seat. once he noticed that he had already pulled over a motorcyclist it was back to the races. 

luckily i did arrive home with a big sigh of relief. i will say that i will never use this service ever again. the single worst $56 cab ride you can possibly have. i don't want anyone to ever experience what i did and potentially with a much worse outcome."
525,negative,i had a stereotypical experience with the mechanics up-selling transmission flushes and other unnecessary maintenance. they need to take more time evaluating the vehicle instead of pushing their corporate agenda of preying on customers wallets.
526,negative,"this place is a scam.  do not ever take your car there you will be so sorry you did.   go to a place that gives a 3 year warranty and doesn't terrorize you while your car is there.  they picked up my daughter's car towed it to vegas, took the transmission out and wouldn't put it back in nor fix it.  it goes worse after that, they refused to tow the car back so basically kept the car hostage in vegas.  we had to hire a transport company and pay to have the car returned.  they operate the business like they are above having to follow any honest business practices and based on how we were treated they are so arrogant they didn't care sbout the negative reviews they will get."
527,negative,"let me tell you something. hertz will steal your money. i had to rent a car from hertz after i was rear-ended on the highway. the first car they gave me i accepted excess insurance on. the very next day i had the car the check engine light came on, so i went back to hertz and got a different car and told them to cancel the excess insurance. i repeated this 3 times to the woman. apparently 3x was not enough and two months later i had over $870 taken out of my bank account. hertz has been dragging their feet at giving me back my money. they have been horrible to not only me but my lawyer and my personal insurance. they lie and they are a horrible company please do not go with hertz go with esurance they are a wonderful car rental company and i have never had an issue with them. the only reason i had to go with hertz is because that is all the other woman's insurance will cover."
528,negative,"this place was horrible they ruined my nice auto they
broke several items.. when i called him after  i drove out after one hour
he said  i told you no warranty.....i wondered why he would not
 warranty even for one year  because he knew  they  broke several 
things under the hood.   the oil leak is severely damage  that has a ninety day on it.  none of these things were that way before he got  my car. now cost  for oil leak according to several other  auto mechanics is
 1,000  to fix.     the air conditioning is broken and wont work. the transmission has no bolts on it now.  they said they replaced several parts in engine and who knows what they did ...they painted it all
to make it look like they did something.  these people wont even give you
fair work or stand behind it.........and keep changing the price as well."

this will be my only post regarding this dealership unless i am challenged. everything seemed to be cool until i found out that the contract that i signed in the dealership office was not the contract submitted to the bank. a false contract was submitted, numbers were changed and my signature was forged on the contract they submitted to the bank. i know this is hard to believe but i have emails, pictures and proof. long story short i had to get a lawyer in order for anyone at cartwright to listen to me. the owner made excuses and lied in order to justify the actions by his employees. the bank resented the deal and  agreed to give me my car back and my down payment. i had the black infiniti g37 and i informed devon that the transmission was slipping at random pretty bad and now some poor soul has inherited the problem. even with a warranty it will cost a arm and a leg to replace it. bottom line is these guys are slickers and will lie to you. when an employee commits criminal fraud and the owner doesn't fire him then it shows that the owner supports these type of deceptive actions. cartwright will have to deal with dmv next because they are reported for their actions and i still may file criminal charges against the individual not the dealership or the owner because he agreed to settle out of court. if anyone has or is having a problem with this dealership screwing them over please contact me cause treating people wrong is just not right!"
530,negative,ignorant employees....they will curse you out if you ask questions. they don't give a damn about your vehicle...they will damage it quick. they give you miss information on purpose so they can get extra fee's. charge you 45.00 if your car won't start. 65.00 just to visit your car in the yard. then they will lift your car on a forklift and sit it outside. the owner shawn davis and his staff are gonna fuck around and get sued. no hoa or customer should ever use this company. the absolute worst people and service period...
531,negative,avoid this place like the plague. there is just a web of lies to deal with. i was told that i would get a $300 deposit returned to me upon returning the vehicle i had rented which let me add had almost 200000 miles on it with a slipping transmission and damages too numerous to list. after i returned the car instead of getting my deposit back i was charged an extra $30 and the man working here basically told me to go f myself. please for your own sake avoid this place like the plague.
532,negative,"do not come here if you are a woman, bunch of douche bags here with too much testosterone looking to make a buck. i originally got stuck coming here because i had a flat. i agreed to two new tires, then they recommended $1500 worth of repairs. i stupidly agreed, tried to call 5 minutes later to cancel the ok to take my car apart, but they said it was too late. so i paid the $1500 and they said ""now your car will be good for another 100,000 miles"". one week later, all of my tire lights and check engine lights came on. they took an hour and a half to figure out that a hose was loose that they had ""fixed"" one week earlier. also, they neglected to put air caps on the tires, so who knows what they forgot to put on inside the car where i can't see. two weeks after this, my tire pressure light was on...the brand new tire they had put on was at 20 psi. i pumped the tires back up with air, then the very next day all the tire lights and check engine came on again. so i dropped the car off and they fed me a bunch of bs about the weather changing. the tires are supposed to be on 60 day warranty, but they didn't mention anything about replacement or compensation, they sent me away with a ""we can't promise anything but we'll take a look"". don't waste your money here, unless you drive a big truck and voted for donald trump."
533,negative,"this dealership misrepresents and does not stand behind their repairs.  our acura broke down while we were on vacation.  we had to have a whole new engine installed.  findlay acura did the work and said we had a 12 month warranty on it.  6 months later, we had to take our car in.  this time it was the transmission.  the dealership said the part that was leaking was a non-authorized acura part that findlay installed.  acura client relations confirmed this fact, yet findley will not reimburse us for the damage this leak caused to the transmission or, at the very least, reimburse us for the cost of replacing this part.  a person pays more at a dealership expecting to get proper parts and service.  this is not the case!  if you see findlay, run - for that matter, if you see acura, run!  we have spend over $11k in repairs in one year.  since we still owed on the car, we had no choice."
534,negative,"i wish i could give them negative stars. i dropped my car off in march of 2013 to get a 2jz motor and transmission swapped into it. long story short they had it for 5 months and almost destroyed it while test driving it and the drive shaft ripped apart. i removed it from their shop and took it to another for a drive shaft. when i finally got to drive it the engine smoked and the transmission would drop in and out of gears. i took it back to them and they told me it was the turbos smoking and needed to be rebuilt and that the transmission needed some special adapter to make it shift correctly. after paying them even more money to fix what should have been fixed or addressed at first, it still smoked when i got it back and the transmission got so bad that i couldnt drive it. i took it to another shop for a second opinion (automotive diagnostic specialist in chandler, az) and the laundry list of things that were wrong blew my mind. i contacted porche at akina to try and work this out and he wanted me to bring my car back to them again. fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, but three times i think not!  stay far away from this shop and any or all who associate with it, i believe they operate on the guise of knowing how to work on cars but for the majority they dont....... the old man was probably the nicest person there, the one always working. i feel bad that he is stuck coaching the jv team. 

worse place ever in my book!"
535,negative,i wanted to go to a transmission place that specializes in transmissions. i want a specialist like when you need a medical specialist for a certain problem with your body.this place does it all which tells me they are spread too thin (like a general doctor who then refers your to a specialist) to really know transmissions well.
536,negative,"i went to dave's three times. the first time was great, although looking back probably a little over charged. the second time was neutral but again looking back (now that i have gone somewhere else) probably over charged. but the third time was awful - right off the bat, just dropping my car off i was treated horribly by keenan.  i was getting my oil changed and and my tires balanced and rotated. i will start with my tires. at the time i brought my car in my low tire indicator was on. when i picked it up, the location of the low tire had moved but the indicator was still on. so i called, i was told my sensor must have been bad. i got off the phone and drove to put air in my tire. my tire was 8 lbs lower than manufacture recommendation. i filled the tire and to my surprise the indicator went off. so i do believe they rotated my tires (for $49.00) but i do not believe they balanced them. now for the oil change. within 24 hours of my oil change my check engine light had come on. over $1000 later it was discovered that a sensor had been switched (the top was plugged into the bottom and vice versa) i realize this could be a coincidence, but my gut says it is not. the sensor is in the same area where you would need to work to do an oil change. the only true question is, was it done intentionally or accidentally? i admit i did not take the care back to daves to see if they would right their wrong. but they had made it very clear to me in the last visit that they had not intention of really wanting my business, so why would i pay them $109.00 to be treated bad? after reading other reviews, i'm sure dave will respond to this review - saying you just can't make everyone happy. i just wish they didn't chose me not to please."
537,negative,"my son' has a 2009 vw eos with about 26000 miles.  it's out of warranty.  the check engine light came on and it was leaking antifreeze (tiny bit).  they had the car forever, replaced the pump (got vw to pay for some of that) then called and said the fuel injectors were bad (really?)  costs to replace 1700.  i put apiece of cardboard un der the car in the garage.  it was still leaking, now more than one spot.  took the car back.  let them have it for 10 days while we were out of town.  norb said the plug on the oil pan was stripped and the pan was cracked.  a mere 500 or so to fix it!!  they came up today and picked my son up to take him down to get a rental.  imports by day will pay for it this time.  this is the worst service center i have ever dealt with, they never return your calls and never have your car when promised.  when that car was brand new (hardtop convertible) 600 miles on it.  the roof got stuck and went off track.  they said my son caused it, would not pay a dime.  it was almost 10,000 dollars.  vw is horrible, horrible, horrible.  they could be giving cars away and we would have to pass.  i highly recommend finding a different place to do business.  what is terrible is you have no recourse but to pay!!  i know the odds of fuel injectors going bad......i don't believe them, but am at their mercy.  stay away and save a lot of money.  i hope this helps some people, i wish i would have read a review or two before purchasing from day!!'
i had to add this today.......norb said there was something wrong w the transmission, the car would not back up.  omg  but he said he got vw to pay for that repair (1700 dollars)  this is insane since the car has been going backwards w/no problem.  not only are they scamming customers, they are scamming vw for warranty repairs that are not necessary.  the car is home now today.  i put s sheet of panelling under it to check for leaks in the morning.  betcha there are a few.  stay away!!"
538,negative,i'm so done with this location you guys did terrible work on my car first off it should not take several days to fix a water pump nor should i have to come back several times after to have you guys fix the check engine light problems and it was all from what you guys did to my car and now the freeze plug needs to be fixed so now you guys want a thousand dollars to even fucking look in there and see if that's the problem maybe it's the engine or something idk what to believe with you guys and if you ever leave your car with them over night they claim to put it in the shop and idk if that's true because i'm not there to see it at night but i stopped by during the day to see how things were going and the car was in the parking lot and the hood was popped and the doors were unlocked like wtf do you guys not give a shit about people's cars this place is terrible and over priced as hell and the wait time for anything is rediculous i would love for a manager or owner to contact me if possible thanks for wasting my time and money
539,negative,"must be a new manager. gives you the hard sell on things that you don't need then looks disgusted when you decline. i paid for my coolant to be topped off and the service was to shoot some water from their hose into my radiator. i'm not jiffy lube  certified, but i can do that for free. one good thing i can say is that the service was quick.
i have some advice to the lube shops of vegas: just change my oil. i do not want nitrogen in my tires, i don't want your ""technicians"" to have anything to do with my transmission or cooling system or my brakes. you may vacuum the floor, but don't bitch about my sons goldfish crackers that have been ground into the carpet. if anyone knows of a shop like this please let me know."
540,negative,"this place is horrible i took my cadillac to them back in 2001 to install an amp and speakers and it messed up the computer to the transmission so i was not able to make it to work and ended up losing my job. i figured cadillacs have that problem with the computers so i gave them another shot at it now 2013 i own a new 07 dodge charger and all it needed was a new deck, but for some reason these guys dont know what they are doing the install went bad and messed up my entire sound system the distrcit manager james was not reasonable wanted me to spend more more money i do not have. if you want a good audio installation, if you want good prices on audio do not go to audio express!! they will ruin your car because they ruined 2 of mine personally!"
541,negative,"went here to get an inspection done since i had tires put on about a year and a half ago. i had to get my inspection done by a goodyear or firestone so i decided firestone since i've been here before even though i don't ever trust this brand.
i honestly think i was stupid and have never worked on a car before. first they failed my inspection for a headlight supposedly being out. (it was a fog light) not a headlight. just trying to make an extra $30 i'm sure. on top of that they said i needed new drum and shoes on the back. ""they are shot"" is what the front desk guy said. said i had to replace them before they would pass inspection. this is where i think they think i was stupid. they offered me $50 off right then and there to do them, so i wouldn't ask any questions. i declined so i went by the auto parts store and got everything for $100 instead of the $400 minus $50 they wanted to do. i take all wheels off since i was going to rotate tires as well. i get the drums off the back and and compare the drum and shoes to the new ones. almost no difference. they needed to be cleaned but that's it seriously. i have pictures if you think i'm lying. i hope the shop knows who is writing this and to make it clear i had a 2008 ford focus. took it to my mechanic and passed with flying colors. what a joke firestone. don't lie to your customer by putting on a piece of paper drum brakes very concerning. i will never be back :) instead try whiteys auto near old town. honest people and competitive prices. trust me they are worth it!"
542,negative,"i do not recommend this shop. i was quoted one price ($600) but had to pay far more! here are the details. don't let this happen to you... they did not have an exchange unit in stock for my car. i was told mine had to be rebuilt. i was quoted a very reasonable price, paid up front, and left my transmission there... i was told it would be done in two days. they would call me when finished. i did not receive a phone call on day two and left a message 30 minutes before their posted closing time requesting a status call. at 11:00 am on day three, receiving no status call, i again called their shop. i was told the job would require an additional $500. my rebuilt transmission increased in price more than 80%!!! several other shops had quoted an exchange price of $895 regardless of what was wrong with mine. i was not told theirs would be any different. since my transmission was now disassembled, and needing it yesterday, i had them complete the rebuild. save yourself time, money and aggravation. take your business elsewhere!!!"
543,negative,"i dropped off our 2001 bmw z3 there for a $130+ oil change before 9am on monday 6/23. when i came to pick it up approx. 8 hours later, there was a 1.5 feet long crack on the windshield. nobody had given me a heads up that my windshield broke while the vehicle was in their possession. they turned over the vehicle to me as if nothing happened. in fact, they could not tell us for sure when or how it broke, not even an estimated timeline, except for their ""theory"" that a chip on the windshield was what caused the crack, and that they are 100% sure that the chip was ""pre-existing"" without any proper documentation or conclusive evidence, except for ""law of physics.""  bmw refuses to fix the windshield or offer any kind of compensation for mishandling our car and the inconvenience they have caused us. their snide condescending comments made it obvious they were discriminatory towards me and my wife because our car is older and that we never get their overpriced recommended maintenance done with them.

now my wife and i are quite reasonable and logical people. we understand very well that a chip is the most common cause of windshield cracking. however, don't tell us that you're 100% sure the chip was not sustained at the service center unless you saw it got chipped and crack right in front of your eyes. you can't even take the time to investigate, ask your techs/carwash attendant and tell us approximately when it happened or they first noticed the crack - before/during the oil change, before/after the car wash, while it was sitting out in the lot waiting for pick-up, etc. - and what exactly aggravated the chip to form a crack. confess the details of the incident! even if there was only 1% chance of sustaining a chip in your service center because of ""law of physics,"" how hard is it for luxury-brand customer service professionals to say, ""we're very sorry that your windshield cracked while it was here. we investigated the incident but we don't have specific details when and how it cracked. unfortunately, it's our company policy that if there's a chip along the crack on the windshield, we assume that it's pre-existing and can't take full responsibility for any damage to the windshield. however, because we value you as a repeat customer and understand that this has caused you inconvenience, we'd like to make sure you continue to trust us and come back, so here's a complimentary oil change on your next visit."" dude, even a free air freshener - something!!! there, that's a free five-star excellent customer service lesson from us to you! they never even offered us water when we came to talk with the manager in person.

anyway, we would never go back there even if it was free and risk getting our car back with broken windshield or who knows what else. jiffy lube could've gotten my oil change done for half the price without breaking my windshield!

here's a tip for those who want to continue to take the risk in doing business with their service center, make sure you document and take photos of every part of your vehicle prior to leaving your car with these appallingly calloused, shady people.

note to shaun ramirez, parts/service director: instead of playing physicist and giving us lesson on ""law of physics,"" maybe you should focus more on learning about high-end customer service that bmw owners deserve regardless of how old their car is or what you perceive their social status to be. assuring us that for every 10 customers you have who are unhappy as us and our friends who have had bad experience with you, you can find 10 who can say you did the right thing is just a proof you have no business to be working for a luxury-brand company to be bragging about your 50% customer satisfaction rate. you and your manager josh should be working at a walmart lube center and not bmw."
544,negative,so i bought a 2007 cadillac cts 3 weeks ago from the henderson store. fell in love with this car and thought it was a fair price. i declined the 3 year extended warranty for the simple fact that i dont drive too much and didnt think i would have any real issues with a low mileage cadillac. that was my first mistake as i declined this option the mood from the salesman went downhill. now since i bought the car and went through my bank for the loan i have driven less then 200 miles and have brought the car back 4 different times to the service area to get fixed. the brakes squeaked when i slowed down no big deal they replaced them then check engine light pops on go to autozone to have them tell me why its the cam shaft sensor again no big deal bring it in to carmax they fix it. take the car home and notice once again brakes squeak and while in park if you push on the brake it squeals then. call down to arrange service with carmax they say bring it in. ok hop in the car and boom check engine light pops on once again. again bring it to autozone to read why engine light pops on and boom same exact issue as before. bring it in to carmax only to find out brakes werent replaced the first time nor was the cam shaft sensor. they tell me they will order the part as they dont have it in house and to drive the car til the part comes in. so bring it in on tuesday june 2nd get a call later that day car is done. go and pick it up no squeals or squeaks from brakes thank goodness. take it home park it then get in on wed. june 3rd and boom check engine light is on again. call carmax car is now back in the shop to get fixed i cant return the car as it is past 5 days i cant add the extended warranty as it is past 5 days i have 8 days left on their 1 month warranty and i  can honestly say i am worried that i just blew 15 grand on a car that is going to continue to have issues. this is my first car buying experience and i would mever recommend going to carmax to buy a vehicle. how do you do a 120 point inspection on every car and yet ive driven mine less then 200 miles and have had this many issues with it. i feel like im dealing with the dad from the movie matilda for real. thanks carmax for making this car buying experience one of the worst situations ive ever had to deal with.
545,negative,"the transmission on my 2014 nissan sentra had to be replaced at 36k miles... i'll never buy another car from carmax. they did not help at all through the process. the cvt transmission is absolute garbage and the prices on these cars are obscene. you're better off at buying from a dealership, fair prices and as long as you are knowledgeable on the car of your choosing you'll save yourself from buying a ""safe"" ""reliable"" car that carmax is actively false advertising. just do some hard research on the car you have in mind and be confident. buying a car is a important investment so don't be stupid like me and get sucked in by friendly sales associates,be demanding, that is your earned money!"
546,negative,"this review is mainly geared toward the service department at findlay acura. we now own our previously leased rdx, and even when we were leasing the car, we had some problems with the service department. when we were experiencing some problems with the car, and came to the service department to get them fixed, they just told us that unless they can recreate the same sound or issue, they cannot so anything about it. we had to go several times for the same problem, because they did not believe what we were telling them, and did nothing except just drive the car to figure it out. now that we have bought out the car, the same thing is happening. we have to keep coming back several times for them to find out what's wrong. we are not picky customers, but we do use the car for business which involves long drives, so we want to make sure the car is safe to drive, and try to fix any potential problems right away. but with this service department it is hard to do so, because nothing gets fixed from the initial visit. 
this time nothing was different. we had a big problem with the transmission, and while they were not able to recreate the problem, they did not try to figure out what was wrong. and with something like this, i don't want to be in the middle of a long trip when my transmission is not working properly, this is why i brought in the car in the first place."
547,negative,"a horrible place to take your car.   i have been a long time vw owner but my experiences with this service department has changed my mind about getting another vw.  i brought in my jetta to have it checked out because i just felt my car was not driving right.  they told me i needed a new valve body but that might not fix the problem so i should probably just go ahead and get a new transmission.  to get that it would cost about $6000.  what?!?!? i told them i would not go with their recommendation to get a new transmission.  i would just pay the $159 that they charge to just look at the car.  when i came back in to pick up the car no one paid any attention to me for 15 minutes and then i was told my car would be up front somewhere.  when i went out front to get my car, it was not there.  i had to find someone to help me find my car.   when my car was found i took my car to a transmission specialist to see what they had to say about my car.  guess what!?!?!?  no transmission problem.  it is an engine problem.  so vw tried to get me to pay $6000 for a new transmission i did not even need.  i have tried repeatedly to talk to someone at the service department to see why they said i needed a new transmission but no one has called me back.  worse place ever!!! don't trust them because all they want is your money for repairs you don't need."
548,negative,"i took my truck in for a transmission issue and was very descriptive on the symptoms.  as always the people that answer the phones and you deal with are clueless.  so after waiting a month to get in,  they said a tech builtin was out on the truck. $600 dollars later,  and 2 days i call to see if they had heard of this recall that was on the news. the recall was out the week before i brought it in and they ran the vin to pull the tech builtin,  but missed the safety recall.  probably because safety recalls are free.  the recall is exactly what was wrong with my truck and was verbatim to what i described. so they fixed something that didn't fix the issue i reported and i am still on the hook for it.  plus they can't fix this deadly recall.  at $95/hr labor rate they are extremely over paid."
549,negative,"check engine light came on right after grabbing a quick bite at the jack in the box next door. went in here since it's literally next door told the guy at the counter ""my check engine light just came on do have a code reader and what do you charge to read the code?"" his response was ""i'll give you the code but that won't tell you what's wrong"" my response ""potentially but if it says for example you have a miss on this cylinder then it will tell me what's wrong"" ""whatever i can give you the code but i'm not going to tell you what's wrong"" ok guy never fucking mind i don't have time for these games i'll just drive up the street to autozone and get the code from them without the bullshit. apparently he was too stupid to realize that i was trying to give them some business, message received you don't want the business have a nice life."
550,negative,"never!  greenway family auto service does not stand behind their work.  my truck required towing and my statefarm roadside assistance coverage directed me to this business.  their inexperienced driver damaged my vehicle trying to get it into proper towing gear (neutral).  apparently, the driver wasn't aware of the transmission release feature used by towing companies when a vehicle cannot be started (for example, a vehicle with no motor oil).  

the owner, vinny lopano, will not accept responsibility for the damage caused by his employee.  in fact, when i reached out to discuss the situation with him, he stated he would not pay for repairs and then hung up on me.  what business owner hangs up on a customer?!  do yourself a favor and stay far away!  pathetic!

i plan to follow up with my insurance company to provide feedback on the roadside assistance providers they choose, as well as pursue legal action.

by the way, note that 4 of 11 total reviews are 1 star.  you're clearly doing something wrong."
551,negative,"i'm going to make this a long one since it caused me some unnecessary $ basically saying their diagnose of my problems were very very bad. if you have time read on .

i've been in the car business for more than 8 years now and i've had my share of experience with all kinds of mechanics. if there's one rule that i have found to be true is that a cheap mechanic is not a good mechanic, a good one won't be cheap! but these guys are not good and definitely not cheap. i have an audi & a benz and both had some issues.. so i was looking for a reliable mechanic. i saw these guys on yelp and i was blown away by the reviews. 70 positive reviews (for a mechanic!!!  wow). i had to check them out.. so i went with the audi since it was due for an oil change.. i also told them to check why the battery & fuel cap light came on when you start it in the morning.. next day i pick up the car and was told the alternator is good but i needed a new battery for sure.. so i did just that.. went and got one ($160) and replaced it.. well that didn't fix my problem but i didn't make a big issue since these things happen.. after all everyone else says they are great. 

now it's time for my mercedes that is stuck in 1st gear and won't shift. i had charged the auxiliary battery at autozone in hopes to fix it myself.. it didnt (i read that this is one of the most common reasons what causes the limp mode). in the process i  switch the cables backwards so it triggered the battery light. i towed it to the shop and asked them diagnose and fix the issues. after diagnosing they said i need to replace the auxiliary battery and clear the light/codes and then they can see why transmission is not shifting. quoted me $215 for the battery and programming. i went & picked it up at the dealers ($115) and asked a mercedes mechanic whether an auxiliary battery needs to be programmed or not. he said never. if the code/light is still on just reset it with an obd scanner (which i do have) and that's it.. i told the guys at cars that. they said 'no no.. he doesn't know what he's talking now about we still need to charge you $50 for programming'. ok no problem, do it. you never want to argue with the guy that is about to fix your car or cook your meal. they called me & said transmission is bad. at least $3500-4000 ($800 labor) to replace it. i know enough for a case this big to get at least a second opinion. so i went to doctor benz (a shop that specializes in mercedes cars) and described the problem. he raised a red flag: if they are charging for diagnosing they should at least tell you what exactly is wrong in the transmission. in this particular car you almost never change the whole transmission. he wanted $200 to open the transmission and see what's wrong & that's used towards the total if i decided to fix it with him. with worst case scenario $2000 total if the module is bad (most of which is labor @ $125 an hour). as i left from there literally the next building there's a transmission shop so i just stopped by to get a third opinion. he repeated the same thing but he was going to diagnose it for free! so i towed the car to his shop to find out that cars didn't even clear the battery codes. they sure charged me for it! that's because it wasn't the battery, it was just a damn fuse!! once we replaced the fuse the code cleared. two replaced batteries for absolutely no reason!  i also called lkq to check for the price of another transmission and see how reasonable is cars with that $3500-4000 quote. lkqs price for a transmission with 61k miles $1450. with 100k miles, $1150. now to be fair i do get discounts on parts at some places but not a $2000 discount ( a few hundred the most)!

i gave the second star because they all have a friendly attitude & advised that since i already replaced the fuel cap the next thing to do was to replace the purge valve. that fixed the fuel cap problem."
552,negative,"summary

-complimentary inspection can be declined (especially if your mechanically inclined)
-smog check and oil service is very well-priced
-predatory business ethics; over charging for some maintenance items
-somewhat long wait time

front desk service is average. they definitely did not look like they want to be there. i feel as though they ask for too much information by asking for your drivers license. additionally, the service doesn't seem very systematic. i am not given an estimate time when i needed the smog check. lastly, i feel as though it should be common courtesy for them to make you aware there will be a ""complimentary"" inspection prior to touching any components of your car even if it is advertised as part of the cheap oil service and smog check. 

the oil service includes a filter and 5w-30 oil. if your car requires a different weight oil, they'll put in a surcharge. not sure what it is as my car doesn't need a different weight. 

the smog check is also good. this is probably the cheapest place to get your smog checks. just don't go in if you have a check engine light. it's not going to pass. 

both of those services probably took 45+ minute wait time. they didn't seem busy either. 

as for the biased-complimentary inspection, i watched them open up some components i know these estimates aren't a general list for every vehicle. if you don't understand cars, the basic gist of my maintenance estimate is that the prices are predatory and you should be getting a few second opinions. below is my take on some items from my list they provided

1) air filter: $298; wow. this job takes 5 minutes in every car that i've seen including my own.
$30 for a high priced air filter at autozone
$268 for 5 minutes of labor???? i understand shops are trying to make money but holy cow, either their hourly is sky high or they're trying to take advantage of me. 
2) timing belt: $900. this is actually reasonable for a lot of cars as there is a lot of labor, but my car has a timing chain. not sure what they were inspecting. really gives you an idea of their work ethic and knowledge.
3) fluid service: $189. seems reasonable. they service the oil, transmission, coolant, brake fluid, and power steering. not a bad price if you don't care about generic fluids
4) hoses-oem: $189. i'm not sure what the pricing is to buy new hoses. at the same time, i'm not aware of it as a recurring maintenance item. the owners manual for my cars all state to inspect and replace as needed. i consider this as predatory only because it's not necessary to change all of the hoses unless they're in poor condition. 

though they really should be getting an extra star for the well priced smog check and oil service, i have an issue with dishonest shops. i understand every one is out to make money, but definitely not like this."

ok, bought four nitto crosstec hds (good and i like them) from them at a reasonable rate. came with all the bells and whistles (3yr warranty and balance/allignment). after four hours i got my truck. as i drove home i noticed the alignment was severely off, it pulled to the right so much i had to hold it left to go straight. no biggie, it's a new set of tires. (four hours!) so i went back immediately. over an hour later they try to tell me my rear axle is not in alignment and that is what is causing my truck to pull one side. i laughed. something this severe would never have been missed by the first inspection, unless they are lying to cover their inability to do something as simple as an alignment. ""the computer tells us what to do..."" said jimmy the manager, when i asked why they missed it. i was pissed, five plus hours and i was two hours overdue at work and was being docked pay for timed missed. dave, the owner, apologized. i wanted compensation. he offered some oil changes. when i pointed out my truck takes 13 quarts of amsoil full synthetic and two filters he took back the offer. jimmy offered some other service. i asked for a transmission and rear axle service in amsoil. dave said no but agreed to the rear axle. i only asked to see what he would say. i didn't think he would actually do it. but, he did. and, hey, why not let them make good on their apology. so we worked out the deal for monday afternoon. anytime. and i drove away with a misaligned truck. later after returning from work i checked the tire pressure. dave said they set the pressure to the specs on the inside of the door frame. the sticker said 50 front 70 rear. i found 65 and 60 for the front and 75 and 70 for the rear. hmmm wonder if the computer told them to do that? 

and here's monday! got there at 1:30ish. decided to sit outside in a lawn chair to observe the ""work"". 45 minutes later (not much going on inside so it wasn't busy) they put my truck on the lift. 45 minutes after that (while i was lodging a complaint with their corporate headquarters) jimmy came over all smiles and gave me a sheet of paper showing the purchase of four quarts of lube. he gave me a bullish*t story about his amsoil rep calling him to replace the 75/90 lube with 75/110 and that is why it took so long. initially i felt kinda bad about bitching to corp. but that went away when i came to the realization they had just forgotten about their deal with me and that was the time it took them to run and get it. i took another look at the paper jimmy gave me. it was for 4 quarts. my truck has a maghytec dif cover and holds six (that's 6 not 4) quarts. i pointed it out to jimmy. he told me it was alright because my truck fluid capacity was in pints not quarts. what? apart from having really bad hair he must have feasted on lead paint chips as a child. and he has a really annoying tendency of walking away from you when you point out the flaws in his answers. even neil, the front desk guy, had that look of ""please go away"" when he would see me. jimmy told me he was out $80 in lube and wasn't going to spend any more money. funny, the purchase order he gave me said $55. not too good at math either jimmy. so, after two and half hours (for a 10 minute lube replacement) i drove home with four quarts of lube in a six quart rear differential and a badly aligned truck. 

lessons learned.
-a good deal on tires doesn't mean it's a good deal on service. check the reviews before purchasing.
-when your gut tells you run don't stay and poke the bear. 
-never go back. ever. if they were the only tire providers left on earth i would sell my truck rather than go back.

i went in for an install on a lower thermostat housing. i actually brought the part with me which cost only like 60 bucks because i was initially going to do it myself. 
they ended up selling me an erg valve because the other one was ""fried"" but had nothing to do with why i went in there initially but i'll take the blame for falling for that one.
so they tell me the car is ready and fixed and that they drove it to make sure it's good to go. 
i pick it up and the next day my check engine light comes back on so i call them and take my car in a few days later and now there is a coolant leak in the upper thermostat housing and they want to charge me to fix something which is the result of the initial work.
so, the mechanic actually instructed me to go somewhere else and buy the part that is needed . i knew at this point o was not going back. 
so here is the problem . i knew the thermostat housing was an easy fix and i already spent 700+ dollars from the initial repair or lack there of.
so i decided to do the fix myself .
upon the installation of my upper thermostat housing i discovered there is a bolt missing off my throttle body and the o ring /gasket is missing on the housing that they replaced. 
so guess what the new leak was due to the fact that they didn't replace the o ring/gasket on the thermostat housing when they put it back in 

so my initial message to them , they responded and that was the last i heard . they said they were going to look into it.the only thing i can do is spread the word.
this problem is leading to other problems like the maintenence light came on (the wrench on the dashboard) so now there is a string of issues that is setting off sensors which i am now just taking care of myself 
honest 1 auto care was horrible and they will not take responsibility for their own actions 
how about i get a refund on the 700+ dollars that was pretty much worthless work. sloppy and lazy"
555,negative,"the only reason i would ever come here again is for a cheap smog check. this place is a rip off. i came by to get my transmission serviced only to be recommended a variety of other things to fix. the guy, john i think (one of the managers), did a test ride and inspection on my car and called back to give me a list of things that needed to be done to my car and also claimed i did not need my transmission serviced. instead, i was offered to switch out a hose for a power steering problem and a couple of air filters which i paid around 130$ for everything.
first of all, although i was not there i have doubts the transmission fluids were checked with the proper camera tool. secondly, on the print out of the work done i was not given a part number for the power steering hose which leads me to believe they simply tightened the bolt since the steering still sounds like crap. the two air filters that were replaced were 15$ apiece on the internet which i could've done myself. 
i feel like i was taken advantage of based on my gender and the assumption that i may not be knowledgble in vehicles. if i say i want my transmissioned serviced, then thats what i need done and not anything else. the only reason i couldn't do it myself is because i do not have the proper tools. 
will not recommend this place."
556,negative,"stay away ! every time we go there they charge us  at least a 500 dollar, but more like a 1k. 2 months ago we had to change our transmission  for 4500 dollars, we asked them to check everything to make sure that everything else is fine with the car. obviously we didn't wanted to throw so much money to a car that needs even more work later (car is only 8 years old , i don't even understand how the transmission could go bad!) they said everything is fine . well it wasn't , because they quoted us 1600 dollars for all kind of repairs now (we brought the car in for an oil change...). some woman there told my husband that these problems happened after we changed the transmission. i cannot believe that . in the last 3 months we spent 6k on our car on their advice (not even talking about previous services, which i also think  they cheated us with some tire change and repair for 1.2k).
they screwed us completely, we throw out  6000 dollars on the window instead of putting it to a new car.
oh yeah , they were servicing our car from the beginning.
please for your own good and learning from our mistake do not go to this place!"
557,negative,"took my saab, 2011, 9-5 to them with an ""apparent"" transmission problem.  i fully explained my story: car ran fine, parked it, the next day, although it started, the car would not move forward or backward, the previous week the check engine light came on/off several times.  josh called me saying the transmission was bad; price to fix was $10,000.  never even cleared his throat.  

i had my doubts, codes were not cited, and three years earlier i had a similar ""apparent"" transmission problem 3 years ago that turned out to be a $25 relay.  i told wright about that experience.  i took the car to aamco in east liberty.  two hours later they called, the codes suggest an accumulator valve problem and suggested i replace two accumulator valves ( intake and exhaust) and change the oil.  price was about $350.  they did it, and the car has never run better. 

dec. 3, 2018 i wrote to the service manager with a copy to cory asking them to review what they did for me and what aamco did and comment to me, either by email or phone.  as of january 8th i have no response from them.  you decide."

560,negative,"what a pure runaround and waste of taxpayer money!

i have been trying to resolve an expired registration tag for over four months and i still cannot get any help. 

first, let me say that my vehicle is over 14 years old and has worked correctly, up until three years ago. that's when the problems started for me and how i have been treated as a criminal, for a check engine light!

the problem is that i am unable to get the car inspected due to the incapable slurry of automotive technicians here in charlotte/mecklenburg county, who seem to not be able to rectify the problem due to a check engine light that doesn't seem to go away, even after over a thousand dollars dumped into it.

 second, is the way i have been treated, as like i have been criminalized for a check engine light which has escalated to an expired tag because of the inability to get the car inspected. 

third, i have gone through all of the motions to resolve the issue, by traveling on my time minus the hourly pay i have lost, to the charlotte/mecklenburg courthouse on several occasions, just to find out that i needed to only fax all of the final documents, with cover sheet explaining that i have gone by the state's rules. and after calling the courthouse, i am transferred to a phone message instructing me how to resolve the matter all over again with what i have already done.
again, this is for a check engine light; not for a dwi, excessive speeding, reckless endangerment or some other valid means for truly having my license revoked. 

i am seriously planning on sending this letter to any or all media outlets, local and nationwide to get this message out that not only does the inspection process full of flaws, but also that the nc state department of transportation, has some serious flaws and is borderline fraudulent in it's practices and that it persecutes people with older vehicles."
561,negative,"this place is a joke - will try and up charge you for unnecessary work.  my wife went there yesterday for a basic oil change and they told her she needed transmission fluid change and power steering adjustments. she didn't know and was told by danny's it was necessary ""preventative maintenance"", so she said ok and they charged her $150 for totally unnecessary work.  i and just taken this car to the original dealer 3000 miles ago and they didn't mention any of this stuff that danny's said needed to be done.

two stars only because they have a good car wash.

know before you go - danny's will try to oversell you on unnecessary up charges!!"
562,negative,"had to update.

after visiting this place for muffler issues 5 times in three years and being told by an employee that my entire muffler system should, and i quote, ""outlast the lifetime of my vehicle"", i actually believed them. hah. they replaced pipes, my exhaust & other odds & ends in my muffler system just in january of 2014... only to find out in september of 2015, that my entire muffler system was shot. i went to a mechanic i trusted, which is what i should have done all along. they fixed the issue and i am relieved it is done... but looking back, i wasted about $1,000.00 over the course of 2-3 years in this place.

don't waste your time with this place. go to a small business & support your local mechanics."
563,negative,today i had a short phone call wirh bell ford service department after this i would not recommend them to anyone especially if your trying to fix a recall i have two recalls on my ford focus that i found putting my vin number in on the ford website the person joe i talked to didnt seem at all interested in helping me when i brought up my transmission recall i explained to him the problems i was having with it he explained to me i would need to pay $165 to get car diagnosed first before they fix the recall. which recalls are supposed to be fixed for free so i told him i would get back to him figure i get a second opinion i contacted peoria ford and they where great all he did was check if they had the parts which they did told me it was no problem to bring it on down and they get all fixed for me with no charge and got me in a date and time that worked for me i highly recommended peoria ford way better service department.
564,negative,"was told my transmission has a leak ($2.5k to fix), second opinion found the transmission has no problem.

i came to usa auto service on my way out of town to get my transmission fluid checked. after inspecting my vehicle, joseph told me that i had a leak in my transmission, in the front seal gasket and said i should not be driving on it at all. he shined his flashlight on the screw, which looked a little oily. he said the leak had made it all the way to the exhaust pipe and if i didn't get it serviced i'd have black smoke coming out of my exhaust pipe. he quoted me $2.5k to replace the front seal gasket. he knew i was in a hurry to get out of town and said he thought his men could get it done today, they would try. i came back after calling another repair shop for a quote and asked if he'd price match $1.3k for the repair. with little hesitation, joseph said 'ok, $1300 flat, no tax.' then he said, 'are you a student?' and whispered to me, 'tell me you're a student, we'll get you another discount.' when i was checking out, another manager todd, came up to me, ""i saw what you did with the price match. that was smart. you schooled him' and gave me a high five.
at this point, i got suspicious and began reading reviews on their yelp page. i choose the shop because it was one of the top-rated on yelp. upon digging further, i noticed most 5 star reviews were for the inexpensive smog check. but there are plenty of 1 star reviews about being told your car needs some $2-3k repair when there is in fact nothing wrong with your car. 
at this point, i told joseph and the other store manager (damon) that i wanted a second opinion before we went any further. to their credit, they gave me a full refund.
the next day i went to st. george's transmission, the locally recommended transmission specialty shop in st. george. they did a full diagnostic on my transmission and informed me that there is no leak, no error codes and my transmission is in good condition. there was a minor leak of engine oil, which i was already aware of and was not worth repairing.

i would not recommend anyone to get their car serviced at usa auto service, especially if you are working with joseph, damon or todd, if you do not want to be inadvertently scammed out of $2-3k in unnecessary repairs.

do not be fooled by how gracious and personable damon is.

566,negative,"it's been seven months and i've already put $1,300 into this lemon. if you purchase a car, have it checked out completely do not believe their sales team or manager. put that car on a lift to check for rust and muffler issues. also have a mechanic and get a diagnostic check on it. don't be scammed like me and be without a car."
567,negative,"i would never go here again. i bought vouchers from groupon and had no idea how bad the place actually was. they did my crv, tried to charge me $14 for a lightbulb that when i got home was not burned out, the oil change that they claim is a $49 value doesn't even include synthetic blend, it's conventional only and it was another $20 for blend. after the completion of the service the car would not start. they played with some things under the hood and then it finally did. half a mile down the road my check engine light came on, which had never been on before. i ended up going to sears and getting another oil change and the light went off and the car ran perfectly. same thing with my girlfriends car. hers is running rough to this day and it has like 20k miles on it. do yourself a favor and just pay a few dollars more and go to a real shop. they also have a checklist of 10 or so things they are supposed to do like check tire pressure, etc. none of which they actually do."

on a friday night, i drove into vegas from los angeles, and the moment i got there my acceleration started acting funny. searching for a place open on a saturday that could take me, i found national auto, and now i know why they weren't busy.

darren, at first seemed helpful. he had me go for a test drive with a mechanic, and everyone seemed to think they knew the general problem, and it would just require a part from a nissan dealer. i made it clear that i was attempting to drive home on sunday, so it would need to be fixed today if possible. urgency was of the utmost importance.

flash forward four calls later (all initiated by me) to 5pm, and they still don't know the issue. several codes have come up regarding the transmission, but as darren describes it, my car is like ""an alien"" to them. this late in the day, i'm screwed, having to stay in vegas until monday and miss work. darren promises me he'll know by 10am monday morning or he'll tell me if he can't figure it out. oh yeah, and his method of investigation for monday morning is to go to the aamco next door and have them take a look. no joke.

at 10am monday, he still doesn't know, i give them an extension to 12pm, and at that point, he says there's some electrical error, but they can't pinpoint the exact problem. there's a short...somewhere. they'd have to take apart the entire engine. i'm not exactly confident this would be a good idea as they'd be operating on ""an alien.""

i tell darren i'd like to just take my car and go to the dealer, and... darren charges me $90 for looking at the car. now, when i dropped off my car, i had specifically asked if that money could be used toward repairs, and i was assured that it would. after a day and a half of being unable to diagnose the problem, because they don't deal with this car often, which they should have told me the minute i pulled up, i don't expect to pay. especially when they knew that i was trying to get home to la and didn't just tell me to take it elsewhere. that is inconsiderate and shady, pure and simple.

i ask to speak to the regional manager because i don't want to pay $90 for wasted time and an overnight hotel bill. the regional manager assures me he has a nissan and can take care of it. after not having seen the car and knowing nothing of my problems, the regional manager says it would cost between $800 and $1500 to fix. after hanging up, darren asks me what the regional manager said. i explain and darren gives me a look, then tells me he'd suggest i just get a new transmission. so someone's lying to me and someone's incompetent. you be the judge. 

i pay the $90, consider contesting it with my credit card, don't want the hassle of bill collectors, and instead have decided to just post this review. darren, national auto, i hope your $90 fee is worth the bad publicity. you shouldn't screw customers like this when you're too incompetent to either a) figure out a problem in a timely manner or b) admit you can't help.

never go here unless you want to waste your time and then get charged for the privilege."
569,negative,"i drive a 2007 c230 mercedes benz. i originally had a mobile mechanic take a look at it and he told me i had a bent pulley (which he fixed) and that i also needed a harmonic balancer that he wasn't able to repair do to not having a certain tool. i decided to take my car down to dave's auto care after i had made a phone call prior to dropping the car off explaining what the previous mechanic told me. i asked if replacing the balancer if that would shut off the check engine light because i was far past my registration renewal. keenan was my service phone call and connect (awesome guy and a real gentleman). anyways after talking to keenan and telling him that my mobile mechanic didn't have the software or tools to don't he work. i had asked him to go ahead and run an analysis on the car for the price qouted at $109. i agreed, and he called me back not too long after... i was in shock needless to say. my car had alot more problems than just the harmonic balancer and i was qouted something around $5-6k and this was way out of budget. i explained to keenan my financial situation and apologized that i couldn't afford these repairs just to get my car to drive legally the money far exceeded the value of the car. keenan was generous enough to let me leave the car there at the shop for alittle while so i could figure away to sell or scrap it etc. i told him if i brought the car back to my apartments with bad tags they'd tow it right away. he agreed (super nice of him). i got a text from keenan yesterday 04/01/19 saying that if i needed to keep my car there any longer there would be a $25/day storage fee. i responded saying i would get my car paid for and towed asap. i called down to dave's shop to pay my diagnostic fee. i was told on the phone about the $109 fee and was rebuttaled with a $900 bill saying that they replaced the harmonic balancer. (i never agreed to this repair) and i also reminded keenan about our conversation of repairing a car in such an amount that would be more than the value would be stupid. i asked him why would i pay for just some of the repair when it does absolutely nothing for the tags and that $900 of the 5-6k repair is just a small chunk on what i was qouted to get my car in a state of safe and legal statues. keenan told me that they have recorded phone call of me approving this repair on a ""time stamp"" and recording. i told keenan that if he could play this recording for me i would gladly take my responsibility and pay for the service. *side note* i never signed a work release form or gave verbal proof. anyways keenan calls me back and says he talked to his boss dave and told me that dave doesn't have to play the recording for me and that i need to pay him. so i asked to speak to dave but he was on lunch and i would have to wait until he was done eating. thirty minutes later i receive the rudest phone call i've ever had from a business. dave introduces himself in an adgittated manner and begins to try and control this conversation meaning he would tell me what he thought he knew about the conversation with me and then ask me questions and before i could answer cut me off. after this pathetic display of customer service he asks me what i want to do option a) and i qoute ""i can rip the balancer off with all the belts bolts etc and, roll it out in the parking lot because he doesn't give a damn"" or he can take me to court. this whole time i remain calm and collected and confused by this guys 39yrs of business in the valley that he had to repeadatly remind me of. ( guess he didn't learn customer service during those 39yrs). anyway he asked me what i want to do so i told him remove the part please and park it in the parking lot. i asked what i owe him and he says $109 then says i mean $135 and he says ""and bring me cash"" i say ok and i proceed to ask about how long until i should come down there and he hangs up on me. i have the whole conversation recorded. keenan calls me back and apologized for his bosses behavior and i went down and paid when keenan called again saying the car was ready. what i believe happened is dave went though those taps and heard that i never agreed for anything other than the diagnosis and was angered because he did work that i didn't authorize. again i asked to listen to this recording and was denied that option. i did not deserve this treatment at all. i did nothing wrong and if this is dave's 39yrs of being proud of his shop maybe a people's skill class might help the poor fello out. again i have this whole phone call recorded so it's definitely not my word against his. thanks again keenan for your professionalism. you where the only person there that brought some positivity to this horrible business transaction."
570,negative,"beware of the so called service specials!!! believe me they find ways to more than compensate for those specials. my check engine light was on with a p1174 code, which indicates either a fuel, or emissions issue. they recommended i do the total fuel system cleaning, which was on special for $199.99 which originally costs $399.99. i had this service done and the service writer came to me telling me they couldn't start the car because the positive cable to the battery was corroded through. the replacement of that cable cost $316.00, what a rip. a half a** mechanic, or even i could replace this cable in less then an hour with a lift and a few tools. they charged me $170.00 in labor and $100.00 for a 3' battery cable and another misc charge of $63.11 for disposal and shop materials. 

this place is out to pick your pockets the minute you walk in. you're not a customer, you're a dollar sign. they got me once, but sure will never be given the opportunity to get me twice.

oh and the kicker is that they told me the fuel system flush took care of the problem. the check engine light was off, but when i got home i rechecked with my car md diagnostic tool and it read yellow and the codes clearly showed an emissions issue. they sold me something i didn't need (fuel system cleaning) when it is an emissions problem. all they did was reset and turn off the check engine light, so i would think the problem was corrected. recommend staying away from this unethical shop."
571,negative,"beware of the scam! these are the type of people who give auto repair shops a bad name.

bring in the explorer to the guy's shop. at first, they seemed nice and had an idea of what the hell they were doing. eeeeee no. they are complete idiots and like to scam people for their money. 

we get a smell of something fishy with their quote so decide to call aamco to see what's up. aamco told us that they were trying to scam us and we need to get it out of their shop regardless. they tell us it will be $350 for them to take the transmission apart which is fine. we get to their shop and they want to charge us double. umm no, sketchy part 2. 

this is where it becomes really really annoying and sketchy part #3. i get in the place after they say they will not charge my credit card over the phone. i go in and their machine keeps declining my credit card that i just put gas on it. umm no, so i try my other 3 cards including my company business card. none of them work. they continue to tell me that it was because i can't pay my credit cards that it is being declined. using some choice words to tell me i am scum. they try to then take my card and type it in. still decided after 20 minutes. i threaten to call the cops and was on the phone when suddenly my card that they said i don't pay off magically worked. wow crazy what calling the cops does. 

we get a tow truck to bring the car to our friend's shop to get it fixed. the tow truck guy gets there and they wouldn't help him put any of the parts that they took it apart and charged us for. 

long story short, they are scammers and try to steal thousands from people. we get quoted 2 grand less from another shop. i hope to have a better experience at the next shop. do not go to them.

**update** aamco was 2 thousand dollars less than these crooks."
572,negative,"first off i want to start off by saying stay far away from this piece of crap shop !!! they are scamming people across town with dishonesty and bad work on vehicles!!! they had 3 other locations in town 1) on boulder hwy henderson 2) tropicana and pecos 3) rancho dr 4) las vegas blvd north ... i put my audi tt in the shop march 22, 2019 at the pecos and tropicana location and was told it needed a new motor by the manager rudy junior in which i said ok order it . they said with labor it will be $3,874.00 . i was ok with it due to it's a audi and the price would be high . they told me it would be done in 2-3 days . i went back there in 3 days and spoke to rudy jr and he said it still did arrive yet and it should be in that next day . after all this almost a month later the motor arrived smfh and i was told that it will be in by the next couple days . they ended up telling me they noticed my clutch plate was showing wear and i needed a new one so i said go ahead and put it in being that it's right there no since in waiting till it goes out and have to do a big job again by dropping motor out . it took about another week just for them to get in the new clutch cause rudy jr said they could figure out why it wouldn't fit and then they found out it was wrong one they ordered. i kept calling and stopping at shop wondering why my car wasn't finished yet it was outside sitting in complete. rudy jr said his european mechanic specialists was on vacation. i then called a week later and was told by another mechanic there that it's just nut and bolt time and should be finished by the next day . i went back and still not completed another 2 weeks later i called and they said rudy jr is no longer at that shop he is at their other location on boulder hwy. i called there and spoke to rudy jr and he said he don't know what's going on with my car cause he has been at the boulder location. he then said he will call over there and speak to george which was supposed to be the new manager there . i get a phone call from george stating they got my car started but it needs a slave cylinder in which is inside the transmission and everything needand that they said they told me i needed but said i declined having it done . i not once said that at all . george insisted that i said that and i said well you need to ask rudy jr if i did because i know i didn't say that cause if that was the case i would of said replace it like i said about everything else . a week went by and i asked again what is going on with my car and george said you need to get your car and have rudy jr deal with it being that he knows what went on with it and i said i'm my car is in this shop not any other one . rudy jr then contacted me saying he sent one of his mechanics from the boulder location to check out my car and he said the mechanic fixed the slave cylinder and i said so you had to drop the subframe and lower motor and take apart transmission to get to it and he said yeah . i told him well that can't be true because that car sat outside every day and they rolled it inside at night only and there was no way possible that work was performed. he said hold on let me ask my mechanic and he then said oh no it needs a hose that's leaking from the clutch master cylinder and they ordered it from audi in new jersey. now it's july 3rd i speak with him about this and he said it won't be in till after the holiday weekend and he will call me on monday or tuesday when it's complete. i waited 2 weeks later due to my busy work schedule and called him on july 16th and asked to speak with rudy jr and they said there is no one here by that name . i said yeah right i just spoke to him july 3rd and they said well we purchased this building alone with 2 others on july 6th . i said who is this and where is my car !!! he said his name was fedel and he is the new manager and the bew company name is purrfect auto with 2 r's . i said i'm the owner of the audi tt wand he said ohhhhhhhhh your the owner and we were wondering who's car this was cause your car alone with 6 others were left at this pecos and tropicana location abandoned and vandalized. i said i'm on my way there right now !!! i got there and my car was in first bay with damage on outside of vehicle and also damage inside along with missing parts from my interior window. fedel said everything was gone to be able to reach the customers that cars were there and even the data base was removed from building which he said was weird because those thing usually are left behind from previous shop owners so the new ones have it . i towed my car from shop to my house after new shop owners tried to say they were going to charge me $35.00 storage fee per day since they took over building . yeah right wait on it  sooooo after all that i contacted snap finance about what happened and snap finance refunded me my $3,874.00 in 2 days after contacting them about what happened! sorry about the long message. do not go there at all !!!"
573,negative,"this is the third of many bad experiences with this dealership.  i first made the huge mistake to get a bmw after my mercedes lease ended.  they are very rude and do not even compare to mercedes in any way when it comes to service.  i just got home from having my car in to replace the muffler (this is a 2016 bmw x3 m sport with 7,000 ams on it). the fact that is needs to be replaced is bad enough. then i make the mistake to leave my wallet in the car, but think later there is no way they would actually steal from me.  i happened to have $100 cash in my wallet.  the minute i get the car i went to where my wallet was and wow - the cash was stolen.  i went to the manager and didn't apologize, he acted as if i was lying.  i do not need to try to scheme for $100.  

overall my experience with bmw from the car itself to the service has ben terrible.  i also wrote a bad review for the sales guy when i bought the car and the sales rep called me to ask me what was wrong?  are you serious.  this is your practice. 

beware this dealership 

learn from me - buy a mercedes. 

i can't wait to lease bust my car and get back with a real luxury car company"
574,negative,"just last month the boyfriend and i brought the car in for a tune up and brakes. (2 separate dates btw) the guy literally took all day to change the brakes, weeks later they're still screeching like if they weren't changed. my bf took it in and they said it's because he drives a lot they need to be changed again.  seriously it hasn't even been a month! if they would've been done right in the first place we wouldn't have this problem. now for the tune up we got charged extra because the transmission needed fluid that only hyundai carries. without our consent btw, if we would've known this we would've just taken the car straight to hyundai! but no they decided to drain the oil and then tell us after they already ordered it. we took it back because it is now running crappy and of course they wanna charge full price for the tune up again. save yourself the headache and pay another shop that actually knows what they're doing."
575,negative,i came to this location for a simple battery and left with a battery and check engine light on. i asked him why is this light he did not know so he dx and said i needed a sensor really  ??  so i left for 2 hrs came back paid and extra $100 deductable on top of my battery. go to my car start it up and the check engine light is on . i go back in the store to tell him and his reply was i dont know what's wrong with it you have to take it to the dealership. whattttt!!  i came here for a simple battery and this turned out to be a bigger problem. i will never go back here that was my first and my last! i want my 100$ back i did not need no sensor yall just tripped something to set my light on!!
576,negative,"wife tried to get a quote for a smog check. the site states, ""it's 45 but will give you a discount of 10 dollars"". it's 15 - 20 dollars everywhere else with certificate and electronic transmission of cert to dmv. 
so i called just to see if it's some gender treatment, well it became 28, down to 25. don't trust these guys, absolute crap!!!!"
577,negative,"they totally messed up my car! i went in for a check engine light and ended up out $1,500 and my car didn't run. had to wipe out my savings to get a new used car and still haven't got my money back. grease foot prints on my floor and door and no interest in resolving the issue. they are super nice mechanics but turn around and scam you out of money. i have pictures of the damage done. really sad situation. not sure why they have so many good reviews. bbb shows same type of complaints at all locations."
578,negative,"i've been coming here for about 10 years so i'm disappointed to leave this unpleasant review after many years of great service.

my check engine light was on. i got my car fixed and took it to get inspected where i learned that i need it to drive the car about 50 miles and that was fine. this was back in november 2017.

 i drove the car about 60 mlies and took the car back where i was told by another employee that i needed to drive the car 100+ miles at this point i am already a little irritated from being told one thing back in november. now it is december when i take it back the second time.

today is february 16, 2018 i took the car back for an inspection and the car has been driven over 300 miles and it is still coming back as not ready. now by a third employee i am being told that sometimes the cars need to be driven sometimes hundreds of miles.  i have not had any work done to it since november only thing i've had is an oil change. 

my issue here is not that the car needed to be driven hundreds of miles (or whatever because i don't know at this point)  - my issue is the inconsistency of what three employees have told me what my car needs to be driven as far as miles and each time i've done that and taking it back for an inspection it still doesn't pass.  so it seems like each employee has just give me a random number to have me only come back with no good results for inspection.

it was nice while it lasted but i will from now on i'll take my car to another inspection place. hate to end the relationship."
579,negative,"this is the most corrupt consignment in the mesa  area. i bought a used rv from them first the roof leaked and then the transmission had to be replaced. i asked them to change all the fluids, they charged for it and clearly didn't do it. don't buy anything from these crooks!"
580,negative,my family has bought 2 vehicles previously from salazar so felt confident in purchasing a 3rd . went to look and got mike as a salesman he was great not pushy or try to sell you on something you dont want or can't afford.  i have bad credit and they actually got me a pretty good monthly payment and a short term so felt pretty good especially sense the claim the car comes with a basic 15 day warranty.  so  that is where the good experience ends they promised to replace the battery but they had the car a whole day and did not replace it or tell us the battery was good but navigation  entertainment system was bad so they replaced it with a $50 cd player then the transmission would kick so bad i felt unsafe and there mechanic agreed but they said they would not fix it for me and gave me back my money that was good with me as i realize the part was not cheap and not good business to fix it at the price i paid but the fact that the next day the car that there own mechanics said is unsafe is back for sell on there lot seems like bad practice to me thanks for reading and hope this review helps
581,negative,"i'm so disappointed!! based on all the favorable yelp reviews i was hopeful to finally find an honest auto mechanic... i did not. i came into the shop to have my oil changed, my car takes 5w-20 motor oil. knowing that conventional oil is much cheaper than synthetic and or blends i requested the conventional oil and waited for the typical dishonest upsell. at first i was impressed , i requested conventional oil and they took the car back. then the manager chris called me into the repair bay, he said my check engine light would come on if i put conventional, when i resisted he stated ""they do not make a conventional 5w-20 motor oil, only synthetic or blend"" i responded there are absolutely no conventional 5w-20 oils? chris said nope in order for an oil to have the ""20"" designation it must be synthetic or blend,, conventional oils are ""30"" or higher. i said ""well ok i guess i don't have a choice, do the more expensive synthetic"" 
i sat down inside and looked up my motor oil and found several conventional 5w-20 oils! when i confronted chris he just stared at me blankly and walked away. i then instructed them to take my car off the rack and left. don't be fooled this place its just another dishonest auto shop... shame shame."
582,negative,they rebuild my transmission it didn't last 500 miles and stopped working they wanted me to pay them again to rebuild it they don't stand behind there warranty  would never use them again
583,negative,i was promised free car washes for my odyssey and now they discontinued them!  my niece bought a used car there a month ago and the air conditioner was broken.  now the transmission is bad and they won't give her a loaner while it gets fixed.  i would not trust this dealer who claims to make 100 point inspections and promises things to new car buyers that they renig on later.
584,negative,"i actually sold my jeep and have no interest in another chrysler product largely due to their service department.

i won't bother going into all the details, but as the most convenient location for anyone who lives and/or works downtown, i often dropped my jeep off here for anything from routine maintenance to larger repair jobs.

not only does it take them ages to get around to working on the vehicle, but 90% of the time after paying and driving home, the issue repeats itself. i've had squeaks that have led to new fan belts (pick up the car days later and it's obviously still squealing), leading to another bill for diagnostic time, and another bill for a new water pump, and still more squeaking.

i know a lot of service departments work on commission, but this place takes it to a whole new level. 

at first i thought i was having bad luck between the vehicle and/or service advisor, but after talking to other people in the area/at work i've come to realize that this very common.

one friend had to bring it in 3 times for a transmission issue while the bills racked up. another friend 2 times and counting for vibrations in the steering wheel. it's almost like they change out a part, bill you, and don't even bother test driving it themselves.

anyway, ended up trading in my jeep for a bmw which was in roughly the same price range and couldn't be happier. i literally sleep better at night."
585,negative,"these people are complete idiots. i got an oil change yesterday. drove for about 3-5 minutes, my car started smoking out the back and the rpm's were going crazy. i pull over on the side of the road, my transmission light went on and called a tow truck. found out today, this place emptied my transmission fluid...it was bone dry when the dealership checked it out and they double filled the engine oil. so now a $25 oil change is costing me about $400 dollars after the tow and dealership fees i'm paying to fix their mistakes. do not go to midas"
586,negative,"i miss fred baker. we've had nothing but negative experiences at the service department since penske took over.

we had our a3 in for a check engine light caused by a misfire. since we'd had a similar issue with our gti that was caused by carbon build up, we asked that they check that first. instead they replaced the coils, $388. ok, well they are the professionals right?

engine light came back on 1100 miles later, same code. they cleared the code. came back on again 200 miles later. new spark plugs, $214. 

when it threw the the same code again, 600 miles later, they finally checked valves and removed the carbon buildup, $829. why did they not just do this the first time we had the car in when we specifically asked them to check this?"
587,negative,"i would not buy from there again. promisses a warranty, but will not call back or respond to emails.

i went there one evening because i was interested in an audi a4.  i asked them if they would take my g35. they asked how much i wanted and i gave them a great deal. 2000 for a car that was worth at least 4500, it had a few things and i did not want to bother.

it was too late for a test drive so i came back the next day. i tried the car and it had a few things as well. when we came back to the dealer i said at one point ""if i buy the car""....this was promptly followed by ""why? your not buying the car?"". i should have left then but i did not unfortunately. instead i signed all the papaerwork and paid full price but asked for a 1 year warranty.

i tried the car out for a few days and i found about 10 things, muffle issues, piston coil check engine, ac issue, water marks on the sunroof panel, glove box hinge broken, armrest broken.

i came back to them and said that i can live with the cosmetic things but they had to fix the check engine coil, the ac and the muffler. they said they would fix all that. i explained to them that they got a very good deal on my car and i did not bargain 1 penny off of their asking price... i did not want any patching or make up. i wanted a reliable job.

they keeped the car about 3 times longer than they said but all seemed fine. i asked for my warranty on paper so they said it would be mailled to me.

10 minutes unto the drive, the check engine came back. the ac and muffler seemed fine. i contacted them with a nice explanation of the code since i have the machine. all i got back was an address, no hello, no goodbye, no thank you...just an address.

the garage they sent me to even asked that if i talked to the dealership again, to have them call the garage since they could not reach them either. they changed the one coil and told me others where fine. they also said that the timing belt was due.

a couple of days later, anothet check engine, for coolant this time. tried to contact the dealer by phone and email over the span of 3 or 4 weeks.....nothing.

i got the timing belt done somewhere else for 800$ and they said that there was also a cam shaft chain tensioner that was due and that would be about another 600$.

but wait, there's more. a few months later, another check engine... coil 3 this time. a freind of a family member helped me out and took a look at the car. 

he changed all 4 spark plugs, coil 3 and a pretty bad patching job that was done on the muffler.... he charged my 200$ taxes and time included.

he said that in fact there was something with the engine but beleived that i could run the car like this. the other mechanic (the 2nd one) that seemed to know audi's better seemed to think it was pretty important to have it addressed shortly so i will probably have to spend another 600$

i waited a long time to post this review, about 8 months to give the dealer a chance to make good but nothing.

sorry to post seemingly negative feedback but the statements above are just plain facts."
588,negative,"do not trust this service department!
we purchased a used vehicle here and have not quite trusted local oil places, so it seemed right to have our regular oil change maintenance done here.  i have not had an issue with this place until recently the check engine light came on in the car.  it was due for an oil change so i made an appointment to have that done along with a diagnosis on the vehicle for the check engine light.  well, by the time i drove to the shop, the engine light went off.  no problem...figured they could check it any way.  well, 2 hours later i get a call that the car needs all new motor and transmission mounts, tension struts replaced, spark plugs replaced, a fuel injection service and a thermostat repair, all totaling $2300!
i know better than to go with my first quote, so i took the car to a trusted mechanic i know.  what does he tell me....car only needs spark plugs replaced and the thermostat repaired, all totaling $450!
this shop was ready to do 'repairs' on my car that were not even needed.  they are a complete fraud and i will not even be returning for oil changes there!  they should be shut down for business like this!"
589,negative,"ask for a smog check not a search and seizure, lol they told me they need to change my cabin filter when they couldn't even get it out, told me that my brake fluid looks dirty and yellow, just checked it , it's clean & most mechanics should know that brake fluid turns yellow after a period of time due to the process of osmosis. & tells me to flush my transmission fluid, when my 2013 hyundai genesis has a sealed transmission even if it was dirty in anyway, there will be no way for them to check it because there is no dip stick, but i guess they didn't know that. if your reading this and don't believe me go google it. lol you don't have to tell me to change my air filter i already know it's dirty  ive been coming to this place for 3 years & used to have respect for them but not anymore. p.s. if you come here make sure you clean the interior after, there's black grease in my glovebox & on my steering wheel."
590,negative,"i was quoted $89 for analyzing check engine light, $150 for a new egr valve, $90 to flush the carbon out of the system, and $29.95 for an oil change. these all totaled would equal appx $356.00. when i arrived i was told the total was $510.00! 

i explained the prices i had been quoted did not add up to $510

the extra charges were shop supplies $31.36 really - how many supplies does it take to replace an egr valve, $3.50 for waste disposal, and the egr valve replacement was $28 more than i was quoted and the carbon flush was $10 more than i was quoted. 

i do appreciate good mechanical work but i don't appreciate being told one price and being charged another. 

they reduced the bill by $25 which is better than nothing was not enough to bring the total in line with the original quote."
591,negative,"never buy a car from this place.  i have a 2015 chrysler 200 and i have took this car in over 15 times for the same issue since i bought it.  the car will shut off while i am driving, whether it is the freeway or on the roads.  i have took the car in multiple times for this same issue to chapman and every single time they give me the same answer ""the oil is low.""  my check engine light comes on sporadically and my battery was just changed in 07/2016 and went dead yesterday already.  i called chapman service department and they told me that their dealership never did change the battery out.  i get the service history report today and my battery was changed out by them on 07/2016.  this car is so unsafe to drive for the kids and i as well as i have another one coming on the way.  i have to deal on a monthly with the car shutting off on me while driving and chapman will not do anything about it.  i have filed claims with the chrysler corporation and still have not got anything accomplished.  this car is very unsafe to drive and the work put out by the dealership is poor.  they do not care about the customers."
592,negative,"if i could rate this place with a negative i would. they supposedly rebuilt the transmission to our company truck, it did not make it 200 miles and broke down. we had to pay for the tow back to the shop and they looked at it again. dennis who is the supposed manager said it overheated from a hose which broke which took over 2 weeks to be replaced. after finding this hard to believe we recovered the truck again which broke down this time after 1000 miles of driving.....this is the best part, now dennis with not warrenty there work stating the problem is the same as the first time and we had to pay for towing a 2nd time. we are proceeding with legal action against this company and have already reported them to bar and the arizona bbb for gross negligence on there part as well as refusing to turn over any paperwork. stay away from this place at all costs."
593,negative,"stay away from take 5 oil change!
take 5 changed my oil in september.  the next morning my one year old nissan marano smoked badly.  i was leaving for a trip so i called the store and told them what happened.  the manager said it was overfilled but it would be ok to drive to florida.  the next day the car was smoking badly.  i went to a mechanic who said i should change the oil if overfilled because it would cause the seals to fail.  tey discovered it had 4 extra quarts of oil and put that in the tech's notes. i returned to take 5 when i returned and they changed the oil again in spite of it being changed in florida.  they did not charge for this $80 oil change and also offered to reimburse me for the $80 florida oil change.  here was an admission of guilt.  they said it would stop smoking as soon as all the oil worked through the engine. i took it to nissan who after checking it out said the seals failed and it needed a new engine.  i returned to take 5 who again said it would stop smoking when all the excess oil passed through.  the next time i went back to say it was leaking oil they refused to talk to me.  i have had to hire an attorney.  it you check their employee reviews you will see the morale is zero and turnover high and management does not exist.  my problem is that they also own meineke muffler, maaco, 1-800 radiator, quick lube, repair & maintenace, carstar, drive n style, pro oil change, paint & collision, merlin oil change with 2,300 outlets.  theyhave additional insulation by being a subsidiary of roark capital group out of atlanta.  stay away they are dishonest.  
it has been 4 months and i still have a smoking car.  by the way, my new car is under factory warranty.  if it was smoking before i went to take 5 i would have taken it to nissan to fix. duh."
594,negative,doesnt even deserve a star.  place commits fraud on your contract.  even right after u sign it they wont fix it.  got a car with a warranty.  guy puy wrong mileage.  went back and pointed it out and he said dont worry about it.  within amonth transmission goes bad warranty wont cover because mileage doesn't cover.  so the owner robert (asswhole)!!!  decides not to fix it knowing the mileage was put wrong!!!!!!!!! pretty much says your fucked and i dont care.  kicked my mom outta his shop.  all we wanted was for him to fixit.   do not buy from here!!!!!!!
595,negative,a shame that they drivers who are rude and have no experience. there drive claimed he could not get my vw bug out of our garage.. due to the fact it was on a income and had no brakes.. here i thought that's why you called professionals in the first place. it took my neighbor to come over and assist us in releasing the transmission into neutral and backing the car out into the street while using the parking brake. it took less then 60 seconds to do this. i guess even professionals like ryan in truck #2 can't know everything!
596,negative,"brought my truck in to install an aftermarket muffler. i was told to show up at 8 in the morning to have the 45min-1hr job done with no problem. well, he ended up running late, so i came in at 11. when i did, he said the bays were too busy so i scheduled a time at 2 pm. they took it in and got the ""45 min job done"" in about an hour and 45 mins. ofcourse they charged me for double the labor time, which i'm okay with, i wish they didn't fool me into expecting it would be done in 45 min,  but whatever, it was aftermarket. this is when the problems began.

about a few miles driven from the shop, the muffler and exhaust tubing started to rattle underneath. especially when in reverse, it sounded terrible. i brought it in again to have it fixed and they were right to it which was great! but i left again, and not more than a couple hours, the hanger they ""welded"" to the tubing to keep it from rattling broke off. i took a look at it and knew that thing would absolutely not hold the exhaust from rattling and sure enough, one bump in the road broke that poorly welded point off from the ""hanger"" and the tubing. i am now in the shop again to fix this issue. they were friendly about it in regards to getting it in quick, but no apologies what so ever for taking my time each day to bring my vehicle in to solve an easy problem they could not solve. and guess what, it broke off again.

i took it into another shop to find out what was wrong because there was no way i would bring it back a 4th time to them. they told me that 2 brackets were missing and the hanger they welded could of broke the tubing if i were to offroad or hit a large bump. they shorted the exhaust system and it hangs lower than it should hitting the crossmember of the frame which is causing that awful rattle noise. i now have to pay another $100 to get this fixed professionally and fix that awful welding job. 


i will never take my vehicle back into a midas nor will i ever recommend anyone to them. if they can't install a simple universal muffler and (i'm pretty sure they stole my brackets) get the job done, then why trust them with an oil change or any automotive repair."
597,negative,"i purchased my 2008 f-250 loaded with lift and extra, purchased the extended warranty and it never covers anything that breaks. i have 56000 miles on this diesel piece of crap. i go to the loan department to ask what does this warranty cover and the guy say "" i have never seen this type of warranty, who sold it to you?"" i point the the guy in the office next to him. he then goes into i dont know mode. very disappointed, emission sensor breaks and the break the up pipe, bill for me, now my drive shaft and u joints need replacing. totally concused on how these are not cover the damn thing doesnt even have 60000 miles on it. thanks ford and san tan, great customer service and vehicle reliablity. i even bought my daugther a fiesta at ford, the transmission makes weird noised, service said thats normal. suprised they didn charge me for that? pretty much done giving my hard earned time an money. what would happen if i actually need these vehicles to get to work so i could pay for all of these inconviences?"
598,negative,"they'll jerk you around from getting your car serviced. when you finally get in, you'll have to wait as they're servicing the lemons they continue selling cars where transmissions fail and oil leaks as early as 7000 miles. 
don't buy a ford and defiantly don't get it serviced here."
599,negative,"omg i wish i had dasha c.' review before i purchased my 2010 650i because just like her the warrenty left on the car was 300 miles i was told that everything had been serviced the brakes oil everything once i hit the 50k mark the brakes are squilling, the transmissions is slipping,there's a ticking noise coming from under the front somewhere.   i've left my salesman glen testament a message i'm hopeful he will respond,  if not i will go to a mechanic and have him run test on the car if all these things are wrong and they knew they sold me a defective car or lemon then i will seek legal advise to remedy the problem"
600,negative,"many people buy vehicle bodys and have the engine and transmissions replaced or rebuilt. i told you and your mechanics this was  on the table. you did not do your job. you told me repeatedly that it was ready to go on the road. i questioned that more than once. you said it was ready. dont try to make me look stupid because you dont do your job! 

again, shame on you! now are you done here or are you going to attack me again!!!



i have been sent 2 private messages from this shops owner. there is a reason he has not responded on this site for you all to see.
he took full responsibility for not taking care of my vehicle. he wants me to trust him to fix the problems.
he had my vehicle approximately 18 days (or more). why on earth would i trust him again! 
he did a couple expensive fixes and got paid $3500 then let my vehicle sit in the parking lot. sent me on my way without even oil in my van.
to give you a better picture of how he took advantage....i am a 62 year old woman who is a disabled veteran. i travel alone. he put me on the road without even a simple safety check.
i only get taken advantage of once. i only give you my trust once. i will never return to your shop. you lied to me. you put my safety at risk. shame on you!

if you want to continue contacting me in private, i will continue to respond in public here. i will also copy your email admitting how you did everything wrong here for all to see.

leave me alone and i will go on my way. i'm not taking down this review. i'm not trusting you with my vehicles again. let this be a lesson of how not to treat good customers.

now......don't contact me again!!"
601,negative,"i too used to think this was a ""good"" shop, with an ""honest"" mechanic. i took my jeep to them with a simple clutch problem. the rod fell out of my clutch master cylinder and needed replacing, the clutch needed replacing as well, i didn't feel like crawling around under my jeep for 2 days wrestling with my transmission by myself so i thought, i'll just let litchfield auto repair do it. a week later they call me to say my jeep is ready. they told me there was grinding in reverse. i'm thinking they are talking about that little bit of grinding you get shifting into reverse sometimes so i go pick it up. pay the almost $3,000 bill (they replaced a head too) and head out. go to the store and when i go to back out of my parking space it won't go into reverse at all, as if i was attempting to shift into gear without using the clutch! it was not going into reverse. now i knew it had to be a problem with the clutch because the clutch pedal feels spongy and it's halfway to the floor. obviously, since my transmission was working just as it should before the clutch job, and the feel of the pedal, and the grinding in reverse is an obvious indication of a clutch issue, and most likely means there's air in the hydraulic clutch system. so after the christmas holidays i take it back to them and say ""something's not right, the pedal's halfway to the floor and i could get in reverse just fine before they replaced the clutch"". they tell me fine they'll look at it again. another week goes by i go pick it up. no change. still no reverse. so by this time i realize they are not going to fix it. i drive it home and tell my girlfriend that i am going to fix it and i am going to take it back up there and confront them with it but that i wanted my girlfriend to go with me because i wanted her to be a witness to the conversation so she could then write her own review about our experience and hear all the bs these guys were feeding me. so i fix it in about an hour in the driveway with my girlfriend watching every move. i kid you not, i reverse bled it and it took me about 30 minutes. my transmission shifts beautifully. there's absolutely nothing wrong with it as i knew, but i had to fix it myself as proof. so i tell my girlfriend to come with me and listen. i told her that i was going to go over the problems with the clutch, the soft pedal, loss of pedal travel etc. and then tell him if he was sure it was the transmission then i wanted to have them rebuild it for the $2000 they quoted me, but only if they were sure it was not the clutch. oh, and they replaced every single part you can replace in my clutch and the clutch hydraulic system. so here's the good part. right there with my girlfriend listening  they told me my synchros in my tranny were going out, and that the new clutch was putting ""pressure"" on my already weak transmission which is why it wont' shift into reverse!! the owner phil, and both of the guys in the office told me the same thing. the owner, and both of the guys that work in the office. same story. at this point i tell them that is very interesting because i bled the clutch myself and it shifts great. bled it one time. they claim they had 3 mechanics look at it. interesting. i'm not a mechanic. i watched a youtube video and fixed it 3o minutes later. it was laughably easy to fix. so i then informed them that not only is it shifting fine, but i also know that reverse has no synchro. mark starts stammering and stuttering and says ""well let me get you the owner"". so the owner comes up to me checks out the clutch and apologizes and says they ""made a mistake"". really? i don't believe that for one second. phil told me he has 27 years experience in the auto repair business. there's at least 8 mechanics that work in the shop. so, with all phil's experience and the cumulative experience of every mechanic in his shop, and they just couldn't figure out how to bleed a clutch? i think not. we caught them red handed lying to us and telling us it was the ""reverse synchro"" (there ain't one), and that the new clutch was putting ""pressure"" on the transmission, what? that's not how a clutch works (it puts pressure on the flywheel) and quoted me $2000 to fix it. when i told the owner phil it looks like he was trying to rip me off for a transmission rebuild. phil then told me another lie and said he wouldn't be trying to rip me off because he doesn't make any money on a transmission rebuild. really? there's only about $400 max in parts to rebuild it. so phil, it has been determined that you are a liar and a crook,  far from honest. you should be out of business. i don't even care about the money but all the lying and trickery. there's no possibility as far as i'm concerned that phil and his entire shop of mechanics can't bleed a clutch. i'm still stunned that the owner and both service advisors lied to me like they did. my girlfriend will be doing a review too she heard every word. what a bunch of crooks! idiots! these guys suck, can't eve"
602,negative,"#firestonecompleteautocare 
my concern about the firestone family is that they operate their stores without a single individual certified to work on your cars. i went to two locations (corporate) by my residence and neither could perform the work. that is absolutely staggering to hear from a national auto shop. not one. i was told by the gentleman at the front that he didn't feel confident in his techs (not techs) ability to do a transmission filter and fluid change. i have never heard of a shop that couldn't take off 14 bolts, change a filter, reinstall 14 bolts and add fluid. i used to be so confident in firestone's abilities a few years back, now just like how the shop wasn't confident in their techs (not techs) neither am i. i would be worried about any car serviced at a firestone if they staff their shops without a single certified tech"
603,negative,"if i could give zero stars i would. by far the worst experience ever, i regret on buying a vehicle from there. not even a month in and the check engine ligt turned on, took my truck in and all they did was turn off the light, until i kept on insisting and then they ""fixed"" the problem. and then 3 months in the transmission messed up, and the help was unprofessional. they dont help you until you keep on insisting. the worst experience ever"
604,negative,stay away from this place. i bought a transmission from them and instantly once it was installed the transmission was bad. the solenoids and pressure sensors went out and the only thing they said to me was to bad so sad. horrible customer service. do not stand by their products at all. stay away
605,negative,"let me start off by saying, i have contacted hertz customer service 3 times regarding this experience. the employees i spoke to in customer service were my motivation for writing, as they displayed such ambivalence toward this matter. it's offensive to me when a company does not value customer service. i waited 3 days for a return call from a supervisor only to receive a patronizing voicemail wondering why i didn't want their $60 gift card. i only wish i could play the voicemail for more to hear it. 
i think yelp is a great platform to raise interest in great businesses. unfortunately i'm having to use it in another capacity today. i recently received poor customer service from hertz in phoenix at their airport location. my motivation for writing this is to help someone else avoid the experience i had, and my greatest hope in writing this is that hertz cares enough about customer service that they read this and realize how much is it severely lacking at this location. 
the individual who issued the keys to my vehicle was very unwelcoming. a man in his mid to late 60s with gray hair. he did not offer any pleasantries, handed me the keys and sent me on my way. this was not an issue for me, but now, for the purpose of the story, definitely worth noting. the vehicle i was issued was dirty both inside and out. there was  dried grass all over the floor mats and the layer of dirt on the windshield required a couple cycles of the windshield wiper fluid before it was transparent again. i was in a bit of a hurry and willing to let everything slide up to that point. i've received poor customer service, everyone has a bad day once in a while. i wasn't too happy that the car was dirty, but i wasn't going to be in it every moment. it was while cleaning the windshield that i noticed the check engine light on. at this point i needed to exchange the vehicle. safety is my number one concern. i brought that to the individual that initially helped me and with no apologies just said listed the cars he had available. after getting another dirty vehicle, i decided to try one more time and got one that was clean with no apparent maintenance issues. 
upon returning the vehicle, i had to visit the office again where i met yet another very rude employee. at this point, i decided after two instances of poor customer service, and difficulty finding a vehicle that was satisfactory, a call to customer service was warranted. i called customer service and was offered a 60 dollar gift certificate. unfortunately i was not offered an apology, a promise to make it right next time, or even a shred of empathy. i was however, treated poorly as if i had some ulterior motive for monetary gain. i called back a second time hoping to speak to someone more interested in their job title ""customer service representative."" unfortunately that employee was the most unprofessional and downright rude of all. i requested i speak to a supervisor and she said, ""i just spoke to one, and there's nothing else they will do for you ."" i replied that i don't mind waiting, but i would like to make someone aware of this issue. she replied, ""nobody is available and its a 48 hour call back."" i did not mind and we ended our call. i just received that call back 5 days later and the message i received was just as disheartening as the experiences i just described. 
i am disappointed in this company and without any effort to make this experience right, i can say i will never do business with them again. i encourage anyone else who values customer service, and good business practice not to give them the privilege of your business either."
606,negative,"i took my cat to ""dave"" and his trained monkey jeff; who proceeded to use me for their retirement fund.

first they tell me they need to just replace a couple of parts which turned in to an entire motor and a radiator etc...etc...etc...

i then drive the car away and no more than 30 minutes later does the check engine light come on.

this of course was followed by a bring it back in and we'll charge you some more speech.

i decided to take it to a dealer who charged me $700 to replace the bad parts these guys put in the car in the first place.

when i asked dave for some kind of a refund for his shoddy work he shut me down and wouldn't stand behind his work at all.  they were faultless.

stay away from these bitter old rip off artists who are going to retire any second."
607,negative,"writing a review on yelp to finally gain attention from management makes me sad.

after saving and plotting, i purchased a new jeep wrangler sahara from chapman in august of 2012.  yes, you can make the snarky joke that it is a terrible idea, but first hear me out.

i was assigned a female salesperson, which seems to be the technique to make a female buyer more comfortable.  she was pleasant, pointed out the amenities, and got me out the same day.  what was missing from the conversation in 2012 was:
  
1--you cannot make appointments for an oil change (first 3 are included however you have to gamble on when to show up-- i went on my lunch break, waited 14 min to be spoken to, then was told they were out of oil and it would be 2 hours.  he was surprised when i said 'no thank you' as if i had the day to hang out.)

2- your service adviser is a phantom voice mail that will never call you back.  anthony salinas was finally assigned to me by my friend at land rover las vegas after his car was cleaned out by chapman's staff and he couldn't get a single response until a yelp review (why i am here).

3-your service adviser can be wonderful, yet is dealing with a shop crew that doesn't honor appointments, or flat out does bad work.  which begs the question--why have a service adviser except to be sweet when saying ""nobody looked at your car today, even though you waited 3 weeks to make an appointment and got here on time at 9 am, i hope you can get to work"" or ""oh, the bar connecting the back gate snapped again breaking your taillight?  that is awful""

4-recalls like: ""a loss of transmission fluid may result in a loss of transmission function which may increase the risk of a crash."" to which the dealership said ""it isn't a big deal, so hold off because we don't have the parts anyway"" yikes

5-you will often see other frustrated customers reduced to yelling at a zoned out service manager in the entrance

6-when the dealership realizes your car has so many warrantied items wrong they will harass you with calls inviting you to ""get into a new vehicle"" -- at 20,000 miles my jeep is pretty freaking new, thanks.

my family has been in town since 1935.  i have owned fords, chevys, land rovers, hondas, and finally a jeep.  i have stories that only girls can tell of the nonsense that shops try thinking i will just hand over a credit card.  however, this has been my worst experience at a dealership yet.  i took the purchase seriously.  i even purchased a lifetime warranty for an additional $3.995 as i expected to own the vehicle forever.  now i am counting down the final 9,000 miles before the standard warranty is up and i can get out.  

water has begun pouring onto the main console (faulty bikini top, luckily we aren't in seattle).  my back gate has broken twice in 1 month.  if you google ""2012 jeep gate bar snap"" you can find forums dedicated to this problem.  jeep designed the gate to operate without a spare tire, so once the standard spare tire is on, the weight causes the bar to snap free.  the ""oh shit"" strap is too long, so the gate continues in motion until snapping off the plastic hinge covers and cracking open the passenger side taillight.  i was told ""i have never heard of this issue"".  well i am glad to (supposedly) be chapman's first case.  not convinced.

so now i am 7 days into ""waiting for parts"", which supposedly happened at 1:41 pm today meaning my jeep should be ready tomorrow.  this is after i stopped in, had my issues recorded then made the appointment to drop it off at 5 pm last thursday sept. 11.  where are these parts shipping from??

run for your life, friends.  oh, and prestige returns your car without the work completed, and sahara jeep will try to charge you for warranty work-- las vegas needs help."
608,negative,"first let me say this was the best shop in my opinion to get your foreign car fixed but now it's ridiculous. i've been loyal to this shop for the past 4 major repairs and when i deadly needed a repair for my car, fred the owner quoted me 1200 dollars to just repair a couple of things when he repaired my transmission at a cost of 700.  i don't know what has changed, seems to be money hungry. overall the job he does is great. the rip off part is new, he likes more money less of customer even when you're loyal to them or not, ridiculous. went down the street after he quoted me 1200$ and got my car fixed by another mechanic for 800$ and fixed an extra part fred didn't mention on the list of repairs. i would say, go here at your own risk."
609,negative,"i would absolutely stay away from tobwin dodge.
in two years, they replaced my engine, turbo, transmission twice. 
and my car was a 2013 and was only a couple years old at the time.
the staff was always so horrible, acted like i was bugging them for updates on my car that they had for over two weeks.
they would keep my car for weeks on end, never making me a priority even after all the problems i had. 
i never had a rental car... imagine spending all this money paying for a newer car that 1/3 of the time is at the dealership getting ""repaired"".. and i'm bumming rides off my mom. 
one time i got a rental but it took going to the top manager of the whole dealership ( not the service manager). 
even the service manager (could be a different manager now) was horribly horribly rude and downa right disrespectful. never returns calls when promised leaving you to call leaving endless voicemails.  
the whole staff was just a joke!

tobwin dodge is no longer that hip cool show you seen on tv. they are now a struggling business with immature employees who have no training.

if their computer does not tell them the issue, they have no idea. no basic knowledge of cars they can only read the instructions. 
many times my car had issues yet they refused to look at because the check engine light was not on. (yet rpm was stuck at 4!)

i sold my dart and go me a chevy!!
my total experience was so bad that i didnt want anything to do with dodge or anything under the chrysler umbrella. 

i will continue to share my experience but it was such a nightmare and had an impact on the way i look at vehicles."
610,negative,"i would say the only redeeming quality of this shop is the front desk employees, every visit they have been very pleasant.

the cost to get work done here is higher than it should be and wait times (granted i generally only have time to go on the weekends with work) are outrageous. on top of that, they charge $100 just to diagnose why your check engine light is on. are you kidding me? i saved myself the headache and money by going to jiffy lube instead - they diagnose for free! and uncovered there was nothing wrong with the car in the first place.."
611,negative,"i had to give them a 1 star because 0 stars aren't and option.  i travel and rent cars on a regular basis and thought i would use them to save a few dollars while on vacation.  the interior of the cars (yes we had to get a 2nd car when the 1st broke down on day 2) were a wreck, the mirrors wouldn't motor driven mirrors wouldn't correctly adjust, the horns didn't work on either car, 1st car died on day 2, the 2nd car took 10 - 20 turns of the key before it would fully turn to start the car and the transmission was slipping badly.  i asked for another but they didn't have any more cars.  i was both angry and embarrassed. they had bad attitudes and wanted me to troubleshoot the car.  i was told the entire deposit would be refunded when the car was returned in the same condition as provided (how could they possible tell unless you crashed the car). they only refunded a portion of the $200 deposit when the car was returned exactly as given. when i called to request the rest of my deposit, i was told that there were taxes and a drop off location fee that was never explained at the time of the rental. these cars are barely street legal and this is the most unprofessional, rip-off organization i have ever dealt with.    the only reason they continue to do business is because people are on vacation and when it is over they go home and realize they will never do business with this company again.  read the reviews and spend the extra money for a quality car and dependable service."
612,negative,"i would not recommend this shop. my 20-year-old daughter happened to see smoke coming from the hood of her car right in front of this shop and pulled in right as they were closing. the quick assessment was that a pulley had frozen and a belt was smoking. she left the car overnight and returned the next day to provide the keys. the shop ended up giving her a qoute for $1625 worth of work, none of which addressed the reason she left the car there to begin with. instead there was a long list of work that was unrelated. mind you this was on a 2002 honda accord which is probably worth no more than $3,000.

the estimate was not free. she didn't sign anything agreeing to pay for the estimate but yet had to pay $122 to get her car back, supposedly the cost for performing diagnostics. ironically, the car already had a check engine light for a failed solenoid related to the transmission but that wasn't listed on their estimate for work that was supposedly needed. makes me think they didn't even run a diagnostic on the car.

we had the car towed to our house and there is discovered the car is perfectly operational. no issues with the belts, no funny noises, no weird smells, nothing. best i can tell is some old oil residue near the valve cover gasket must have dripped onto the exhaust manifold and burned off causing the smoke.

i'll replace the valve over gasket myself and clean the engine. probably less than  $100 of parts and an hour of labor at best. certainly not $1600 worth of work. they tried to take advantage of my daughter."
613,negative,"i really didn't want to have to write this since my family has been going here for years, but it's safe to say this is the last time we'll be taking our business to them. 

we dropped my car off three weeks ago for the check engine light. for the first week, we didn't hear anything back from them. they hadn't even looked at it so they could give us an estimate. by the end of the second week, they'd finally given us an estimate but said they needed to order a part that wouldn't arrive until the following week. they said my car would be ready for pickup this past thursday. they lied. 

i work two jobs, and without my car it's hard to get rides to either of them. unfortunately for me, as of today my car is still not ready to go. for a repair that they said would only cost around $500, i can't imagine why it would take this long. if it was a difficult repair, i would've at least liked some kind of warning. 

additionally, the customer service is not as great as it used to be. the owner is irritable and unwelcoming to the point where it seems like he's annoyed with the fact that we brought my car to him. well, he can rest easy knowing he won't ever see us again. very disappointing."
614,negative,"i received a mail flyer and checked out their lot today. i own a 5 year old dodge and i understand the car guy wants to make a sale however he made me not even want any dodge in general. the purpose of their misleading sales flyer is to get you in for their raffle and the thing wasn't even a real raffle it was just a quick way to get your credit run and take your hard earned money on an ""upgrade"". the guys telling me my 5 year old dodge is probably going to have transmission problems so that's the reasoning on upgrading for security in case that happens.... like why would i want a $30k car with a pending transmission problem potentially in 5 years.... i don't understand. now guess who has a car for sale on craigslist?? bittersweet. retrain your sales people too."
615,negative,"first of all i would like to say the manager mike tried his best but was failed by his employees ( i know the feeling)! we went in there in mid may for an oil change, transmission service and tire rotation and to have the air conditioning checked out because it was only blowing 70°, we also needed the driver side window motor checked because it wouldn't go up or down, after looking at everything our service advisor says you're right there is something wrong with the ac we need to start with a $200 service, i said do what you need to do because we paid for a 7 year bumper-to-bumper warranty when we bought the car, he says you don't understand that would not be covered because the car is five years old and five-year-old cars are supposed to lose coolant, i said not unless there is a leak, this is exactly why we need to fill it up to find the leak, at this time i am upset and ask him 3 times for the manager but he chose to argue instead, after changing our oil he comes back and says sir we can't help you on the air-conditioner because it needs to be serviced, i stood up and looked at him and said you either get me the manager or i will find him myself , it was at that time he decided to go get the manager, 10 minutes later we go into the managers office and he starts to run his story in front of him, so the manager told me the charge is for the deductible of $100, i said no you are misunderstanding  he wants to charge me for a full air-conditioning service of $200, at this time the manager got upset with him and said we do not do this, he has a full warranty, you need to fill it up and put dye in it to look for the leak, once again he looks at the manager answers but it's a five-year-old car with 54,000 miles on it, it's supposed to be low, the manager tells him we would be breaking every law in the book if that was the case because it is illegal to let customers leave with the air conditioning system leaking , so then an hour later he comes to me and told me they found the leak and they had to order the part and it is on backorder but they're going to put us in the car. to make this long story short two weeks later we get our car back and on the way home we noticed that there is greasy footprints on the carpet, when i get home i noticed there was grease smudges all over the seats and the door panel where they took apart to get to the window regulator had grease smudges as well, i called him and complained and he said he wanted to make it right for me to bring it back, i said absolutely not i live 50 miles away so he sent a driver out to pick it up and brought us another car for us to drive, four days later we get the car back cleaned and in really good condition almost like new inside, then my wife drives it to work that night and come home the next morning and told me the tire pressure light is on, so the next day i go out there and check all the tires and they all had below 28 pounds per square inch in them, remember when they rotated the tires, yeah me too nobody ever check the air pressure in my tires after being at the dealership two times and spending three weeks there, i can honestly say if i ever step back into a honda dealership to buy one of their cars, it will not be this one but it is the closest one to our location so i might be looking at toyota in the future. sorry mike i know you tried your best with what you had but it just wasn't good enough for the money you guys charge. forgive me but i must tell the truth on the review we are supposed to receive in the mail. but on the bright side i did give you two stars because you did try your best, but i can't keep running back to a dealership that is treating us this way. for what it's worth thank you, and thank steve for me also."
616,negative,"thrifty trans is a total ripoff ,cheat ,swindle. please don't go there. they broke a part and didn't replace it, instead put the broken part back on. they told me they broke it before they completed the work on my transmission and said they ordered an new one however when i got my truck back it was the broken part they put on and it was all messed up. when asked about it they said they didn't brake it, that it was like that when i brought my truck in. they are liars and cheats!"
617,negative,diabolical..dont fall for the pump fake !! drinking malt liquor in the shop so called working on your vehicle disconnect the battery so check engine light goes off type of individuals...run on sentences are all i can use to describe this atrocity of a business..bad business totally on every iota of their operations. fraudulent smog checks! my children inhaling exhaust and whatever the $!#&÷/\€£ else ! defaced my motor cover allowing their ferril dog to gallivant the shop! came back like 7 times in the first 4 days dealing with these clowns.. if you want a 300 percent loan on a vehicle this is a great place for you..
618,negative,"crooks! i went in for an oil change and to also see why my check engine light came on. i was told by the very rude lady at the front that it should only take an hour and the oil change would only be $10. after an hour of waiting in the lobby i walked outside to check the status of my car to see that it had still not been moved from its parking spot. i asked how much longer and they told me my car would be next up. finally someone moved my car and pulled it into the shop. not even five minutes later my car was back on the lot and had been replaced by another car. must of been a girlfriend of one of the mechanics because they were being a little to friendly and touchy when the lady pulled up. i guess you have to be sleeping with the mechanics in order for them get the job done over here. i asked why my car was moved out of the shop and the rude lady at the front told me that my oil change was already done and they were just waiting on the diagnostic for my check engine light. i felt a little strange because i never saw them hoist my car up or anything so i knew there was no way my oil change was finished but i shrugged it off and continued to wait. i wasn't in a hurry. i had now been there for two hours when my car was brought back into the shop and raised on the hoist rack. it then sat in the air for fifteen minutes while the mechanics stood out front of the shop smoking cigarettes and eating burgers someone has brought from arby's. whatever i thought, these guys gotta eat. when they decided to return to working on my car from their break the first thing they did was lower my car from hoist, keep in mind in sat up there for almost 20 minutes and no one even touched it so why were they bringing it down? the owner then came and got me to talk about my car, he told me the check engine light was on because of a massive leak that was destroying my belts and spark plugs. a job which he quoted me $600 to fix and highly recommended i got it fixed during this visit. i asked him if i absolutely needed to do all of that to turn off my engine light because i knew i would not be able to pass smog with it on and he said yes. i told them i would have to come up with money and i may be back to have it fixed in the upcoming week. this is when things started to really make me mad. i went to pay for my oil change and my total came out to near $80! i asked why because the oil change was only suppose to be $10. they told me the diagnostic fee was $50 and i was also charged for a smog test, which they failed. i asked why they didn't tell me when i first came in the diagnostic fee was $50 i was just wondering what that light was and why it was on. i didn't even need a smog check either so i really have no clue why they charged that for me. however, i paid their price because i didn't feel like arguing with them about the money, they had already wasted almost three hours of my day on a job that was originally quoted one hour. anyways, i go to autozone the next day and explain my situation, they guy reads my engine codes, for free by the way, and explains to me the light is on due to an evap leak, usually caused by a faulty purge valve or lose gas cap, so i both parts and go out to my car and replace them, super easy fix and i only paid $30 for everything. a week later my engine light cleared and car has been running great since. however, it has now been three weeks since my visit to this terrible shop and my change oil light has come on again? did they even change my oil this day or did they just clear the light and move on? i called to explain what was going on and was hung up on three times. these guys are guilty and they know it. will never return to this place and i hope they fail as a business. it should be illegal to try to profit off lies and deception. if i would have paid the $600 that day i would still have a car with no oil and the engine light would have still been on because they didn't even know what was wrong with it in the first place. very angry writing this. stay away from these crooks and do not support this business at all"
619,negative,"this place came recommended by my old mechanic, but after going there, i wont be back. one day took my vehicle in for an oil change, and within the first 5 miles after service, the check engine light comes on.   its still unclear what caused the light, but i gave them the benefit of the doubt and brought my second car in the next day.  
i asked for oil change with full synthetic and trans drain and refill  and innew filter.  they told me this car has no trans filter, and i tried to show them online it shows an external filter in-line on trans hoses.  even showed where and how to access it. they insisted it has no filter, and refused to look at my info i offered.  after done, i got home and looked at my paperwork, i see that they  don't listen to customers at all, as they gave me standard oil and not the requested synthetic.  also, on checking my fluid levels, i find that my trans is grossly overfilled which is just as bad as under filling.  wish i could recommend. they were fairly polite even in arguing my point on the trans filter, but thats the only reason they didnt get one star.  
by the way, after todays service, im totally convinced they did something yesterday to cause my engine light to come on. 

i had the excess trans fluid removed.  a good two quarts overfilled!  very bad!"
620,negative,"my motive in writing this review is to help possible future customers of this business avoid the financial headache that my fiancé and i went through as a result of valley automotive's incompetence and poor business practices. over the past couple of years we gave this shop $1000's worth of business between 3 different vehicles. i noticed how their shop was progressively empty especially in 2015. unfortunately with a decline in business they've resorted to desperate, questionable and fraudulent practices. the long and short is that they caused significant damage to my fiance's 1997 bmw by leaving it in the hands of a non certified tech. charged us to repair the engine. guaranteed their parts and labor for 12 months. returned the car with a check engine light and severely rough idle. accused us of wanting free work and insisted that we pay additional money to diagnose a problem that was due to their poor workmanship. they actually accused us of harassment for requesting that they honor their warranty. the issue never came to resolution. in addition to this, my fiancé dropped off the vehicle and the owner of valley automotive gave her a ride to work. while in the car alone with her the owner kc aka kalvin cox thought that it was appropriate to begin disclosing his issues with anger and sex addiction. this made her extremely uncomfortable understandably being alone in a car with the owner of this business acting in such an unprofessional manner. all governing agencies are currently being made aware of the issues that we had with this business. my hope is that no one else be subject to such an experience. you've been made aware!"
621,negative,"day has had three strikes and will never get my business, wish i could give 0 stars.  first, my mustang was having abs light come on, so i took it in to get fixed, they told me it was a $120 abs wheel sensor, even though i told them i already replaced it.  they they said that didn't fix the issue...go figure.  then they said a wire touches my exhaust pipe and must of melted together.  they told me they were going to charge me $350 to cut the bad part out and heat shrink new wire.....basically rig it.  i told them to just give me my car back, i can do that.  $300+ for labor, sensor and them to not fix my abs issue.  

second i needed to buy a couple of pieces of hardware for my mustang, waited at the parts desk for 45 minutes was bounced around to 3 people saying the parts guy will be right there.  finally a guy approaches me says his system was down and took my name and number....never got a call back.  

finally, my f150 was seeming to have a transmission leak and of course my warranty was going to expire in less than a week.  i live 50 miles from washington ford where i bought my truck, so i talked to my local dealer day ford to have it looked at.  day told me i have to wait 6-8 weeks for a transmission specialist to look at it (unacceptable) and at that point i would no longer have a warranty.  so i called washington ford and they took my truck that night and everything was resolved within the warranty time."
622,negative,"do not take your car there. first off, i should have taken it to a dealer but didnt think that checking a fault code would be a big deal, but....... so we bring in our car that has a check engine light on. they said that the computer is showing misfires on 2 cylinders. they said a basic tuneup would fix it. so they replaced the plugs, plug wires, rotor and  distributor cap. over $300 later, the check engine light came back on with 10 miles of driving the car home. i called to see what could be done and they said they would have to start all over. i said what do you mean start all over. you used the code reader right and charged me for it. he said yes. i said, well what about all the new parts and labor that i paid for and didnt need? he said, well thats just how things work. so now i just spent over $300 and nothing is solved. he basically said screw you, we got your cash!!!!   do not take your car there!!!!!"
623,negative,"1st time taking my car here but will probably be my last. the $7.77 smog check brought me in but then afterwards they told me my power steering hose was leaking and my transmission fluid needed to be replaced okay i understand that and the technician david said my mount need to be replaced too but they needed to check stock so he told me to go back inside to the waiting area. said it would take an 1hour and after an 1hr 15min i asked how much everything would cost and he talked to the receptionist and she said to him that she though he went over that with me, just the lack of communication for one thing and almost two hours later after david came back in and said my car was ready i proceed to go out side to find the hood still up and so i go back inside and ask how long would it be and she says about 10 more minutes. this place has really bad communication skills. last time i'll ever be coming back here!"
624,negative,"took my car in to have 2 tires replaced and get an oil change, pretty simple stuff. i drop it off at 12:00pm with a pick up time of 5:00pm that night. i get a call at 4:00pm saying that my car should be ready at 5:00pm. i arrive shortly after 5:00pm only to be told they hadn't even started my car yet. so they rush to get it done and after an hour and a half give me a measly $50 off, and a coupon to bring back to get my wheels aligned (which they should've done anyways but there was another car using the machine). 

that's not even the worst part, now that i've had my car back it sounds like the muffler or tires are about to fall off. people get in my car and it sounds like a hummer when it's a 2013 honda accord. whatever they did, it's not good. i will never be taking my car or any one else's car to firestone and will be visiting my own dealership and having them take a look as it could have very well been something firestone did incorrectly, in which case i will be contacting them to pay for it. 

stay away from this repair shop."
625,negative,had a check engine light on and needed an inspection i came in and they told me it would be an $80.00 diagnostic fee. i was fine with that. the issue with the check engine light was #4 cylinder missing. i already knew this. nate told me that someone installed the wrong spark plugs and they needed changing and the 02 sensor needed replacing. i oked the work picked up the truck and in a few days the check engine light returned with the same error #4 cylinder missing. it was evident that the plugs were not the problem and no diagnosis was properly done. so paying $500.00 i wasn't happy. called and talked to nate and told him the problem he said come on back. i was out of town. i called today to set up bringing in the truck tomorrow and i mentioned that i would like to be reimbursed for the plugs that were not needed. got a call back from greg the owner and basically said the plugs were the start of repairing the miss. sophomoric and unacceptable. this review will be posted with the bbb as well. usually honest people care about their patrons. not just see $$$$.
626,negative,i don't know why my last honest review was removed it must be because they have a paid subscription. i bought a used truck about a month ago on a friday afternoon on monday morning i called the dealership to tell them that the check engine light was on and i was told that i should know that the warranty only covered the engine and transmission. i ended up taking the truck to my auto mechanic who diagnosed that it had a bad catalytic converter a bad battery and the radio was intermittently working and it needed a heater switch too. the dealership is made no attempt to contact me to make anything better and i've now had to put over $1400 of money into this truck that i bought a month ago after the dealership said that the automobile had been inspected. i don't know who does the inspection but they sure did miss a lot and i would suggest if you want to buy an automobile from these individuals you should have the vehicle thoroughly checked by your own mechanic.
627,negative,"took my ford escape to metro ford service dept for diagnostics since the location was convenient. after charging $250 for diagnostics on an abs light, rear differential leak, and possible power take off leak, they quoted me $2000 to replace the tone ring and the pinion and axle seals on the rear differential but advised there were no problems with the power takeoff.

after calling other mechanics for quotes for the suggested repairs, i ended up taking the escape to a different mechanic recommended by a friend. the new mechanic advised that half the repairs suggested by metro ford didn't actually need to be fixed and that there was in fact a problem with the power takeoff that if i didn't get fixed was going to cause transmission problems! all in, the fixes came to only $600.

don't take your care to metro ford unless you want to pay through the nose for substandard service and for repairs you don't actually need."
628,negative,"the worst customer service ever and constantly lying about anything they tell you . they offer you a 2 year warranty that they will not honor . i took my car in to get the transmission overhauled only to get it back a month later with the same problem occurring over and over again and after five months of back and forth at the end i was told to come pick up my car and it was in pieces with my original transmission 
in the trunk and of course i had to pay for the tow truck.
do not waste your time or money . 
save yourself the headache and agony . go somewhere else ."
629,negative,"i needed my radiator replaced asap and, as someone relatively new to las vegas, i relied on yelp to choose an honest, competent mechanic. the owner of liberty tech may be friendly, but he and/or his team of mechanics are not reasonably priced or competent. 

(1) competence: 
prior to getting my radiator replaced, my transmission shifted perfectly. on my way home from liberty tech (directly after the radiator was replaced), however, my transmission was kicking roughly and shifting improperly. not surprisingly, when i told the owner about the transmission issues stemming from the radiator replacement, he became defensive. he acted like the transmission issues were just a coincidence as it's not surprising for 7 year old cars to have transmission problems. he disagreed with me that it had something to do with the radiator replacement but said he'd take a look at it. 

i felt like i was just another girl getting hustled by a mechanic so i took my car to somewhere else for a disinterested opinion that i could trust. sure enough, the disinterested mechanic said that transmission fluids drained during the process of replacing the radiator and should have been checked and replaced. he said that this is not uncommon, and was shocked that another shop failed to check and replace the transmission fluids (as this is a standard practice among competent mechanics). low transmission fluids are extremely rough on transmissions and i'm lucky i promptly hired a competent mechanic to discover the problem before i drove more on low transmission fluids and damaged parts. 

(2) price:
the full cost of changing the radiator was approximately $200 more than the average cost for my make/model/year. i accepted the price because it wasn't worth the hassle to transport my car to another shop and i assumed i was paying more for a higher quality shop. 

summary: 
pros: 
-nice. 

cons: 
-overpriced. 
-incompetent in replacing radiators. responsible mechanics check, and where needed, replace transmission fluids after replacing radiators as transmission fluid is often lost in radiator replacements. 
-uncomfortable waiting room. the a/c felt like it was turned off or broken in the waiting area."
630,negative,"nice, genuine guys but they wasted my time and misdiagnosed my car. said i needed a repair done that had nothing to do with my check engine light and that it would cost me over $600 after charging me $130 just to diagnose it. they also admitted to not really knowing what was wrong with my car, not being familiar with ""newer"" cars, and told me to bring it in some other time for more ""diagnosis"" after i suggested that they take a look at my evap system, which is exactly what my check engine light was on for. after taking it to another car repair shop, my car was properly diagnosed and taken care of within an hour for only $200. i'd avoid for anything other than simple repairs."
631,negative,"beware of this place of business...upon picking up vehicle again from this place-asked if check engine light was addressed-among other things-when vehicle was returned to them due to still having problems with car...was told by the manager brandon law, that the check engine light wasn't on...daughter gets back in car...guess what? yep-light still on...when asked about it brandon law states 'oh he -technician-just told me' and then doesn't want to talk to me stating ""you came in frustrated and you're not going to want to listen to anything i have to say."" man i have every right to be frustrated-every dollar worth of frustration spent on this car (2,700) but how are you gonna handle the situation mr. manager... de-escalate me!!! i didn't curse you, i didn't raise my voice...be a manager...talk to me...
brandon: ""well we can diagnose it and see how we can discount""....
me: (walking away on the word 'discount') yeah y'all have a good day....

it should've been diagnosed...y'all gets no more money from me. 

i'll trust a garage mechanic over brandon law and his crew"
632,negative,"bought a used car from these guys late in january of this year. numerous problems would take place after the money went through to them. i purchased the car online through cargurus. they hired some random guy to transport my vehicle across the country for a disclosed amount of money, they said they were covering the cost. this person dumped my car off at a random parking lot, locked the keys inside the car and left it. sat there for 5 days until the manager of the store called it in. they told me they brought it to an audi dealership to get it re-keyed. i trusted that they were doing everything possible to make sure the car was as it left the dealership. in the process of getting into the car, the driver's side window switch/regulator was damaged. fully knowing it was wrecked, sent the car off to me otherwise. i eventually paid for the transport myself to ensure i got someone trustworthy. they didn't even offer paying for any of it. after an almost 2 month ordeal, i finally got the car. a day within having it the check engine light came on. o2 sensors were bad. took it in to get it checked out, found there was a coolant leak. the right rear rim was bent. john bennett said he was going to set up a wholesale account through my preferred dealership to help cover for costs of the door and rear rim. he lied about it all, my dealership never got any information about it and said he's never heard of that happening before. i ended up paying $735 for the window and i'll end up paying for an entire new rim. not going to be cheap. not professional at all in my opinion to send a car with all these problems, all to save some money on their end. don't trust these guys, they lie right through there grimy teeth."
633,negative,"if you're having your car serviced here, beware. i began having transmission issues a few months ago. i took my 2012 ford focus into ganley's service department. they told me there was a recall on my transmission and they would be doing some kind of update. i thought this would solve my issue, but it did not. after i got my car, the same transmission issues began immediately. i called and they said to bring my car back in because there was some additional recall (why they didn't do everything at once, i'm not sure). so i brought my car in on a friday with half a tank of gas. after a week (with no loaner) i called and asked what was going on and what was taking so long and they told me they were cleaning up my car as we spoke, that they had to test drive it to make sure it was working, and that i could pick it up in the morning. relieved, i went to get my car the following morning. first of all, they never cleaned my car. the white mats they put in over the car mats were still in the car, they didn't wash it, and tons of dirt was everywhere. i was relieved to have my car back so i didn't say anything at the time. then, i ran out of gas on my way to work because they ran my gas out. further, the transmission issue happened again the same day i picked up my car. i called and they said to bring it in yet again and this time i could have a loaner. well- i dropped it off before easter. it took them almost one month to return my car- saying they had to order some part to fix it. but they never updated me and i was always having to call to see what was going on. their salespeople also kept calling me off the hook trying to convince me to buy a new car instead- i genuinely felt like they were holding my car hostage! finally, i called and they said i could pick it up. i asked it they would look at my window to see why it wasn't going down. they forgot to get an estimate and it took them another day to do it. they gave me the estimate and i said i would come pick up my car. i went to pick it up and first of all, the car had mud all over it. there was a mud pile in my back seat! also the door panel was loose from them taking it off to do the estimate and it pulled off, and the foam lining around my window was ripped. 

all in all- it was almost comical how dreadful this service department was for me. i called multiple times to the gm to discuss this issue- he never called me back."
634,negative,had a check engine light on  went to midas he said it was a couple of  oxygen sensors. he said that the sensors would be 438 dollars but he would give me a good deal on the labor only 80 dollars. i thought it was pricey so i went to auto zone and they said it was actually only one sensor duplicating and that sensor was 99 dollars. wow saying i needed two sensors when  he knew it was only one . all i can say is don't trust this shop. it was the owner who gave me the quote
635,negative,so an update of my 2007 cadillac cts. i pick the car back up on june 4th and this time i dont even make it put of the parking lot before the check engine light once again pops on. i turn around and drop it back off once again. carmax calls the next day and tells me basically they have no idea how to fix it and they are sending it to an actual cadillac dealership to get looked at. great. somehow during the process of all of this the fender next to my back rear tire gets bent out as well and they say they will fix that. get a call a week later car is finally done. the cadillac dealership replaced all 4 sensors plus some sort of dashboard computer. pick up the car and rear fender is still bent out. i tell carmax about it and they say they will order a new fender to put on it. its now been a week later i still havent recieved a phone call from carmax in regards to the fender. my warranty is expired and they refused to at least give me another 30 day warranty. seeing as how my car was in their shop for over 2 weeks you would think they would at least give me an additional 2 weeks but nope they didnt. i would tell everyone do not go to this place and buy a car. worst experience of my life.
636,negative,"if you're going for an oil change or smog check great place but anything else i would say find somewhere else. the last 2 times i took my car up there they told me i needed waaaayyyyy more replaced then what was actually wrong with my vehicle. this last time really was ridiculous. i came in because i thought my oil was leaking really bad so i brought it up there to get checked out. they guy at the front is amazing and has great customer service but i can't speak for the others. i had to keep calling them to keep up to date on my car and every time i called i was put on hold for like 20 minutes! anyway, so they tell me i needed a couple things replaced but it didn't sound right. i took my car somewhere else and it wasn't even leaking oil, it was transmission fluid!!! they told me they could just tell what was wrong by just looking at it and they were completely wrong! if you're a mechanic i don't understand how you can't tell the difference between oil and transmission fluid. definitely love the location but other than oil changes and smog i wouldn't suggest you going there."
637,negative,"do not! i repeat do not! go to this establishment.i used their coupon of 9.99 big mistake. the manager rico is the scum of the earth, he acts like a wild beast out of the jungle. this guy is provoking and rude and will try and find something and when he can't find anything wrong he creates a problem. they didn't just change my oil, my transmission oil pan was puncture where it came out all on the street and i could no longer go forward. my mechanic said it was patched with some kind of putty, good i did not drive any further. i had no problem with my car at all until i left there. $250 worth of damage. i am calling the corporate office letting them know who's representing their name, reporting them to the bbb, putting them on the rant, and calling action news so no one else goes through this. this nitwit is trying to keep a job at everybody's expense. this use to be a wonderful place but they have since changed hands and the current people will cause somebody's  life. i hope to put them totally out of business and maybe he will think of his shenanigans and become an honest person."
638,negative,had a transmission repair done on 11 may 19. one week later i got a recall for the problem i had repaired. the letter said if i had paid to have the repair done to go back to the dealer for refund. the part repaired was a lead frame assembly. second recall on this. first was to do a computer reset. service tech told me it was not covered because of a diagnostic code. i said that didn't make sense because the recalled part had to be replaced. i called ford and got the run around from them and was told i would have to deal with san tan ford. it was their call. i have been dealing with san tan for years for maintaince and new vehicles and have been a ford customer all my life. never again!!
639,negative,"i'm going to make this a long one since it caused me some unnecessary $ basically saying their diagnose of my problems where very very bad. if you have time read on .

i've been in the car business for more than 8 years now and i've had my share of experience with all kinds of mechanics. if there's one rule that i have found to be true is that a cheap mechanic is not a good mechanic, a good one won't be cheap! but these guys are not good and definitely not cheap. i have an audi & a benz and both had some issues.. so i was looking for a reliable mechanic. i saw these guys on yelp and i was blown away by the reviews. 70 positive reviews (for a mechanic!!!  wow). i had to check them out.. so i went with the audi since it was due for an oil change.. i also told them to check why the battery & fuel cap light came on when you start it in the morning.. next day i pick up the car and was told the alternator is good but i needed a new battery for sure.. so i did just that.. went and got one ($160) and replaced it.. well that didn't fix my problem but i didn't make a big issue since these things happen.. after all everyone else says they are great. 

now it's time for my mercedes that is stuck in 1st gear and won't shift. i had charged the auxiliary battery at autozone in hopes to fix it myself.. it didnt (i read that this is one of the most common reasons what causes the limp mode). in the process i  switch the cables backwards so it triggered the battery light. i towed it to the shop and asked them diagnose and fix the issues. after diagnosing they said i need to replace the auxiliary battery and clear the light/codes and then they can see why transmission is not shifting. quoted me $215 for the battery and programming. i went & picked it up at the dealers ($115) and asked a mercedes mechanic whether an auxiliary battery needs to be programmed or not. he said never. if the code/light is still on just reset it with an obd scanner (which i do have) and that's it.. i told the guys at cars that. they said 'no no.. he doesn't know what he's talking now about we still need to charge you $50 for programming'. ok no problem, do it. you never want to argue with the guy that is about to fix your car or cook your meal. they called me & said transmission is bad. at least $3500-4000 ($800 labor) to replace it. i know enough for a case this big to get at least a second opinion. so i went to doctor benz (a shop that specializes in mercedes cars) and described the problem. he raised a red flag: if they are charging for diagnosing they should at least tell you what exactly is wrong in the transmission. in this particular car you almost never change the whole transmission. he wanted $200 to open the transmission and see what's wrong & that's used towards the total if i decided to fix it with him. with worst case scenario $2000 total if the module is bad (most of which is labor @ $125 an hour). as i left from there literally the next building there's a transmission shop so i just stopped by to get a third opinion. he repeated the same thing but he was going to diagnose it for free! so i towed the car to his shop to find out that cars didn't even clear the battery codes. they sure charged me for it! that's because it wasn't the battery, it was just a damn fuse!! once we replaced the fuse the code cleared. two replaced batteries for absolutely no reason!  i also called lkq to check for the price of another transmission and see how reasonable is cars with that $3500-4000 quote. lkqs price for a transmission with 61k miles $1450. with 100k miles, $1150. now to be fair i do get discounts on parts at some places but not a $2000 discount ( a few hundred the most)!

i gave the second star because they all have a friendly attitude & advised that since i already replaced the fuel cap the next thing to do was to replace the purge valve. that fixed the fuel cap problem."
640,negative,"unfortunately i cannot give 0 stars :( i took my car in for a transmission flush, when my husband got home he looked at my car and somehow knew it had not been flushed properly and he suspected it had only been drained which is probably half the cost as i beleive our flush was around $249. he made a few phone called over the next few days where everyone stayed it had been flushed until he finally got the shop manager who said it had not been flushed because their machine was out being serviced and that he would call back when it got back in and we can bring our car in to do it again properly. no call was received, i finally just called them back this week of course no one knew anything about it. i told them they should be able to look and see when it was out being worked on and see if the date my car was in there was in that period of time. they said they would have the shop manager call me............ i'm still waiting"
641,negative,"horrible service. if you are out of warranty don't go to this dealership. my mazda is out of warranty and it was originally misdiagnosed by the service manager. i guess because horne recently took over this dealership, they are not as experienced with mazda cars as other dealerships. i left horne mazda and went to berge mazda for service. the service manager at berge was polite, the issue with my car was accurately diagnosed, and i was given an estimate for the repair that was one third less than the quote provided by horne mazda (approx $150 less). getting my car repaired at horne was a stressful experience and i found the dealership's customer service to be woefully inadequate. they wanted to charge me an excessively high price for diagnostic tests (each diagnostic test was a separate charge) and repairs. (note: it reminds me why i quit getting routine repairs done at dealerships. however, when i owned a toyota the service was so good and reasonably priced - i started using the dealership for maintenance and repairs.) tips: i like mazda cars and recommend them. if you need service, i highly recommend going to another dealership (not horne); so, you won't be overcharged. i learned that repair costs at mazda dealerships can vary - so beware! you have options."
642,negative,"i agree completely with aaron's statement ""the sales staff here are super friendly, though not all that knowledgeable about what they're selling.  it was quickly apparent to me that i knew more about the car i was buying than they did.""

while our salesman was polite and friendly he could not answer simple questions about the vehicle that someone in his position shouldn't have an issue with. as an example i asked him if the test vehicle had an upgraded stereo system and his answer was ""i don't know... i think so... umm, yeah."" which doesn't inspire much confidence when i should be dealing with an expert in his field. after a little bit of research i found out the sportwagen doesn't even have an option for an upgraded stereo.
 
a prime example is the work up sheet that his mgr. emailed to me later in the day with the wrong transmission on the car and not all the options that i specified. attention to detail is critical when considering making a large purchase and obviously he doesn't feel the same way i do when making this assessment.

due to our experience we chose not to purchase our new car from this dealership and in fact bought ours from ca."
643,negative,"if you are somebody who owns a luxury vehicle you probably expect a certain level of quality and service to go along with it. while this collision center provides a good level of quality for repair i wouldn't expect any service if i were you. 

we have recently gotten our car back from a fairly minor repair as far as collisions go. the mercedes needed a new bumper, door skins, and some other odds and ends. this took about a month to do and certainly wouldn't have even been started if we hadn't stayed on top of them. so here is what you can expect:

blame. it's always your insurance company's fault. any and every delay is because your insurance company didn't do anything right. great tactic since they aren't there to defend themselves. if you are blessed enough to have karen then expect this blame with a certain level of attitude that says ""how dare you even bother me.""  not sure what training seminar they learn that at, but it's not appreciated. 

absence:  so the blame is what you get if you get ahold of who you need to speak with. don't expect that though. it's amazing how much they are out or on the other line. 

lack of communication:  if you do get them and they aren't blaming your insurance company then don't expect an idea as to when your car will be done. don't even expect an update. it was too much for them to even send me a picture of the work getting done. this is 2016- send a text. not difficult. 

a mad spouse:  yes, this is terrible. i insisted on a mercedes repair instead of where she wanted. my fault. 

so in summary- if you just have to have your car repaired here plan on lowering your expectations.  they will be rude from the girl who greets you at the door to the supervisors who tell a different story as to why your car isn't done. you won't be happy here."
644,negative,"i went in for my check engine light on my vw jetta. all the staff were very nice and friendly so i felt comfortable. after heights swedish solution's spent a few hours figuring out what was wrong with my car, they called me to say i need new spark plugs for $675 plus tax! i thought that seemed really high so i did a little research before i committed. repairpal.com says the national average for spark plug replacements is $127-172. i then called the vw dealer in the area and they estimated $175-185 for new spark plugs. i felt so upset that they tried to rip me off $500! i politely turned down the service and went elsewhere. very disappointed with my service there, i would not recommend heights swedish solutions as i do not find them trustworthy."
645,negative,"i took my truck here for years and look what i got they blew my engine because of there negligence. this picture is not my car i have a 2009 chevy silverado i took every month to them i got a coolant flush than a week later truck overheated to the max got that handled them took it for a regular oil change that cost 90$ few days later i noticed its was leaking oil took it back they said it was fine the next day all my oil was in my driveway. took it back and hey gave me a free oil change because it was all drained out. 1 week later the check engine light was flashing i pulled over had it towed to my mechanic, day later he said blown engine basically then took to the dealership for a second  opinion they said the same i asked why did this happen he said has my truck overheated lately or lost a lot of oil     

sure did due to this place i filled a claim and they turned it down after 1 months later a 5000$ fix 

please don't go here and let this happen to you 
i have contacted my attorney and channel 9 don griffin they are both on this thank god!!!!!!"
646,negative,do not go to this place for car service! i have had 2 horrible experiences with the staff here. i have transmission issues with my vehicle. these issues are under recall. the 1st time the service representative denied the issue but eventually fixed it. the second time i went there with the same issue they wanted to charge me $2000. i decided to get it towed to get a second opinion. they had many excuses and were in my business on personal matters of the vehicle. they did not want me to take it to another dealership even though it is my right. they denied my tow truck from removing the vehicle for no viable reason. no payments owed and i gave a release on the vehicle. this delayed my other service. their are many other opinions i have but these are the facts. go elsewhere for more genuine staff.
647,negative,"really bad. quoted on the phone $274 for 8 days. upon pickup it was $324 (hidden fees they didn't share). i was drawn to this place because i thought it was $75 cheaper than everyone else, but everyone else didn't hide their fees from me. it still was $25 less for the 8 days than others, but oh how i would have gladly paid the extra $3 a day in retrospect. the fleet seems to be made up of a bunch of old chevy impalas. our car was 9 years old, with body damage, smells inside, uncomfortable seats, with 182,000 miles. we drove the car to prescott az where it was below freezing temperatures. the heater failed on us, we were pulled over by the police at night because a tail light was out, the tire pressure warning light came on and stayed on, and the transmission was slipping. we visited autozone and discount tire to deal with the light and tires, but i was unable to fix the tail light  because it wasn't just a bulb out, it was all corroded. when i went back to the rental place several days later to swap out cars because of these issues, there was no surprise or sympathy that i had to deal with all this and no offer of compensation. they just gave me another crappy chevy impala to drive. i've learned my lesson to pay a few dollars extra and use a reputable car rental place."
648,negative,"i take it back, i had my transmission fluid changed there in december, i took my car to pep boys this week and guess what they recommended... i need my transmission fluid changed because its really dirty. boooooooooooo midas"
649,negative,"do not service your vehicle here. even for an oil change. this place is full of the biggest scam artists and liars. i brought my car here for an oil change on 10/10/18. dropped it off and went down the street for some food, received a phone call from one of the ""service techs"" asking me to come back so he could speak with me in person. when i arrived my car was smoking and i was being refused service because apparently my engine was blown. he told me it was going to cost 3-5k minimum to fix. weird  because i drove my car there that morning and everything was fine, no check engine light, no overheating, no weird noises. i asked for my keys back so i could get a second opinion. the tech advised me that my car would not properly run and it was a miracle i even made it to the shop that morning. i asked the tech if they could flush everything out and still perform the oil change. they refused saying flushing it would lock up the engine. i asked for my keys back again and in order get my keys the tech made me sign a waiver saying they didn't touch my vehicle and refused me service. after i signed the waiver they told my boyfriend over the phone that they had topped my oil off for me. when i left the shop my car was smoking and jolting which i had to pull over and call a tow truck. i brought my car to another mechanic and he informed me that usa auto had overfilled my oil by five quarts, which is why it suddenly started smoking and not running properly. long story short, after flushing my motor and changed the oil my car is running perfect."
650,negative,"lack of accountability and professionalism. 

had a new transmission installed in my 2014 ford escape. after paying for the services, i drove my vehicle off the lot and heard a high pitch sound coming from the driver side of the engine compartment. immediately turned around and asked what the sound was, as it was new and i have never heard it before. was told that they could not verify the sound was new and had not been present prior to installing the new transmission. told this was a separate problem that needed to be diagnosed. after several hours of back and forth, it's determined that the cat tube was not reconnected by the servicer. a thorough inspection should have been conducted prior to me being told the car was ready and me paying for services.

incredibly disappointed with the service and lack of professionalism. i recommend doing a test drive prior to paying if you do decide to conduct business with this dealer. i will not return in the future."
651,negative,"oh my gosh what a horrific experience. i took my car there because my transmission was slipping, the next day i called and asked to see when it would probably be done, he said come down after 1230. well i didn't make it down there till 3 o'clock. i walked in and he proceeded to lecture me on how to drive my car. i honestly think that's when they started working on my car. so an hour later around 4 o'clock he finally ,took me out to the garage where my car was, and it look like he was just finishing up. he told me that he was just topping off my transmission fluid making sure it was full.   there a transmission fluid all over the floor. i wasn't even a block down the street and learned that my car wasn't even engaging in gears,,, i heard grinding and it was slipping even  worse than when i brought it there. when i got home i noticed there were scratches on my car that weren't there before there was transmission fluid all over my floor mats in the front and transmission fluid dripping down the front of my car by the wheels both sides of the hood, what a freaking mess, hopefully all that went wrong was he didn't put enough fluid in and there was no damage. but it sounded horrible coming home. i honestly think no one has the mechanics license in that place. no one knew what they were doing. i would not recommend this place at all it was a horrific experience."
652,negative,"my first visit to whitey's for an a/c recharge was great, which is why i returned for another service - but this service left a bad taste in my mouth. i needed a simple oil change and tire rotation - i called to make an afternoon appointment only to be told they only do oil changes first thing in the mornings when its cooler. um ok well i work construction and start work at 5:30am so i cant get in there first thing in the morning and wait and they are closed on weekends. the person i was talking to on the phone was very short and seemed annoyed at my situation but offered to have me drop off my truck the night before for them to have first thing in the morning. i agreed to this so i could pick up the truck on my lunch break the next day. i dropped the truck off at 5pm the night before - 10am the following morning i still haven't been told its ready. i called to see if it was ready and was told it hasn't been started on yet and the mechanic was hoping to have it done by closing that afternoon. what happened to only doing oil changes in the morning? i was told this was only for waiters not drop-offs at this point. i told them i needed it by 2pm when i got off work and they said they would get it done. i make arrangements to get a ride and pick up the truck after work. i pick up that afternoon hoping to be done with this nightmare only to find puddles of oil under the truck the next morning. upon inspection i found oil spilled all over the top of the motor by the fill spout, oil dripping down the side of the motor on the exhaust manifold (which made a great smell) and suspension. there was oil dripping from the filter and oil pan and even the transmission. i cant believe what a sloppy job was done, now i get to spend my weekend cleaning the garage floor and oil off the truck. i was looking for a good local mechanic but honestly i'll pay a few dollars more and stick with the dealer next time."
653,negative,"do not go here to get your car repaired. i had a small fender bender that i needed repaired and ended up have to take my car there 6 separate times for repairs. 
my first visit my car was with them for a week and i was told it should only be a couple days. i called them after a week had passed and asked if my car was ready and they said ""well we called you on this day"" so you called me once? i didn't even receive a phone call from them and they hadn't left a voicemail if they did truly call. 
the 2nd time i went in because my paint was clumping and my two decals (they go on my doors) were no longer matching. they had then burned through my panel while trying to fix the paint issue and i had to leave my car with them another 3-4 days. they did give me a rental car for free. regarding my decals, i had to be the one to say something, they had returned my car with two completely different decals without any notice. also, i had plasti dipped the front of my car, the accident was in the back, and they removed the pasti dip from the front, i have no idea way why it's not like it was in the way at all, two totally different locations on the car. i now have to go and buy more plasti dip to replasti that area. 
the 3rd time i went in i had to show them my issues with my car (is there a quality check?) i was given the impression that i would be leaving my car to be repaired, nope i would then have to go back in a week, wasting a trip because next time i went in i had to retell them the issues. at this visit they had told me they made me another rental car reservation so when i dropped my car off the next time it would be a 10 minute process. 
the 4th time i went i had the impression it would be a quick process, nope it took an hour and a half. i show up, i have to show my issues on my car again (i found 12 mistakes in all and some where from the accident still), then they actually didn't have a car for me and i had to be taken to the enterprise main office. so after waiting about 40 minutes to be taken to the office i show up and they had no reservation for me in their system. another 30 minutes goes by finally make a reservation and is given a car. a nissan versa, i drive a ford mustang these are definitely not the same car classes but whatever. the thing that bothered me was enterprise had given me the car on completely empty, i couldn't even get home without getting gas. also, the car was dirty on the inside and outside and it smelt like cigarettes. 
the 5th time i show up (after them having my car for a week and a half), this should also be a quick visit, nope there for almost two hours and i ended up being late to work. i get my car back and look around at it, and they literally did not touch my rim at all (they took my valve cover off, still a scratch on it from the accident, and someone smeared the paint as it was drying so it wasn't a clean paint job). i had made it clear of the rim issue during my 3rd and 4th visit. they bring the lady out and i tell her my rims aren't even fixed yet and begin telling her why, she tells me ""well rims scratch"" but see the issue here is my rim wasn't scratched before the accident and i paid you guys so that's not a valid excuse. also, my other rims are plasti dipped blue and she could not ""confirm"" the bad paint job because my other rims are blue (this one is silver), i tell her i would rip the blue off, but that was not necessary. they get the geico representative, george, to come and address the situation. he sees the issue right away and says he will get it fixed. instead of a rental car this time i am given a loaner wheel. 
the 6th time i didn't go to gerber themselves (was sin city wheels and tires) but i had to go pick up my wheel, and it looks like the hadn't even fixed the paint issue on my rim again so i'm sure i will have to travel a 7th time. 

during all these trips i had wasted gas and my time. i shouldn't have to travel 6 separate times for a company. and for this to occur while i'm dealing with the insurance side of the accident it was definitely not a good experience. the only reason i gave them even two stars is because the people at the front desk were always super helpful and kind to me and they paid for my 2nd and 3rd rental car.

update: they told me to message them regarding my service, i did and heard nothing back. highly don't recommend this company. reduced to 1 star.
also, i have found overspray on my mirror, this is the only place i have allowed to paint my car."
654,negative,"i bought a 2015 honda fit brand new, and the transmission completely went up and needed to be cometely replaced in two weeks!
repairs took a week longer than told. when you pull up to their service area, they guys in blue shirts who are supposed to take care of you, huddle together completely oblivious that you are there.
while my car was being repaired, i got a lift from their shuttle service which is driven by an old man who doesn't have a gps and sings to the radio the entire trip with the ac on full icy blast while he smokes. he drove the other passengers first to the town next door and an hour later i was still in the shuttle and back at the dealership. i only live ten minutes away.
    i got an accessory to put on the car, the idiot salesman forgot me in the waiting room and it took them two hours to put on what i can do myself now in ten minutes. when i confronted him about this, instead of apologizing , he and i got into a yelling match.
   i called their finance department because i had a question about my warranty. when i called i asked,""yes, i'm inquiring about the length of my warranty.""
their representative, before asking my name or policy number answered, ""oh, i don't know.""
i replied, ""how would you? i haven't given you any info about me or my account yet.""
duh!
anyway, i completely regret buying my car here, its been one mess after another with really poor customer service all around.
you have been warned by a frustrated and annoyed honda west client.
addendum: so today june 6,2016  i bring my car in for some work and i hear a voice bellow from across the access way, ""mr. fitzgerald!"" as if i was in trouble or something. i'm approached by the service manager who asked/confronted me about ""you gave us a bad review! i'd like to know what happened.""
""where do i start?"" i replied, and continued to explain every mishap detailed above. he listened with a very hostile air about him, this was not someone trying to be helpful this was someone letting me know they were upset over their bad review.
at the end of my explaining, (which i had no intention of discussing when i got there because its stressful enough for me to go there now knowing my history with them), so at the end the one point the guy makes with me was, ""well you said our driver smokes and he doesn't.""
as if in the grand scheme of things that washes everything else away.
so for the record: i will retract that the driver smoked but now let's talk about everything else. i guess my transmission needing replacing on a brand new car after two weeks was made up? me having to wait two hours to get an accessory on that takes me five minutes? the salesman getting into a screaming match with me about it?  their clueless shuttle driver with no gps taking me on an hour long drive to the next town over and getting lost when i live just ten minutes away?
   anyway, when the honda guy above replied to my post, he makes it seem like he's trying to be all professional, dont believe the hype. i wasn't approached amicably  to seek resolution i was confronted and challenged and made to feel uncomfortable over my ""bad review.""
avoid this place at all costs!!!!"
655,negative,"the service here is horrible! we have a jeep and a chrysler purchased here, both with their extended warranties. we will not take our vehicles here for anything but service under the warranty. my oil change there there was accompanied by a laundry list of work it says it needed. first item on the list was to flush and service the transmission - funny i had that done elsewhere 9 months earlier. today chrysler is in for a small oil leak that is covered by the warranty - had an appointment for 1st thing this morning and it was there by 8 am. spent the day with no updates despite 2 voicemails left with sa (they never answer their phones directly always goes to vm) called again and told operator that my vm being ignored - she said my sa went home and transferred me to his backup. car never left the parking lot the entire freaking day. will be in shop tomorrow, so day 2 without a car."
656,negative,"i will never bring my car back to this dealership. i took it in bc i thought i was hearing a noise and while it was there they told me i had an active recall. fine no problem, got the car back everything  seemed fine. i'm driving 80 down the freeway about a month later when my shifts itself into neutral and i have traverse 4 lanes of the 51 with no control over my car.  a wire was replaced into the harness on my transmission and left completely unsecured. it came loose while i was driving. i was literally a flying brick down the freeway. if it weren't so early in the morning i could have been seriously injured or worse. 

this is sloppy. absolutely sloppy and careless work. i will never trust this dealer's service department for anything ever again."
657,negative,"so , after about 4 years of service visits with chapman for a vehicle that i bought brand new in 2014 , here's my review of the most recent visit . 
i have pretty much always come to chapman for all of my service needs - oil changes and such . as my vehicle is still fairly new, i haven't needed much . i visited this location again 7/28/18 for an oil change , my appointment was set for 11am and even with an appointment i was quoted a wait of almost 2 hours . the tech did a walk around before taking my car back and apparently noticed a ticking sound coming from the car . i'd never noticed it (as i am always inside of the car) , he stated he would have the tech take a look at my car while the oil change was being done . after about an hour and a half , my car is finished . i ask about the sound the tech noticed he stated ""oh yeah um , they didn't say anything about it . it's probably a belt . just make an appointment , pay the $150 diagnostic fee and we'll see what's going on"" .. meanwhile , i still have a warranty on my car . i'm not paying a fee for something that's clearly covered under warranty (which i now know is coming from the belt , under warranty!) . scam ! i even have a printout of the 5 year warranty , provided by the service department, that remains on my vehicle . being that i know this is warranty related , i'll take my vehicle somewhere else have it serviced and trade my car in for a better make and model . nothing dodge/jeep related . now , all of a sudden , my ""check engine light"" is on . coincidence ? no . mind you , this is not my first shitty experience with this service center , but this one definitely deserved a review . once your initial warranty is expired, please be prepared to be nickel and dimed to infinity . the waiting area is less than acceptable , the techs are either super nice and not knowledgeable or very knowledgeable with terrible attitudes ."
658,negative,"i'm a former auto technician (i've written for motor, motorage magazines) but sometimes i'm just too busy to do my own work.  so occasionally i'll turn one of my vehicles over to a shop, usually with very specific directions on what i want done, what brand of parts i want used, whether to repair the vehicle or inspect and advise me on the diagnosis, cost, etc.   i've turned to greenway family auto service twice now.  never again.  first time i go to pick up my car, which was running great when i brought it in, and it wouldn't idle.  barely ran.  the cause is unimportant, (although greenway caused it), what's objectionable is the tech didn't bother to test drive the car, or didn't even notice backing out of the bay the repairs had induced a serious driveability problem.  i also started seeing transmission fluid on my garage floor after a transmission service at greenway.  i start the motor, let it idle in neutral, pull the dipstick and it's overfilled.  wtf?   more recently i took it in with a complaint of ""power brakes intermittent --- check for cracked hoses, etc - and check out that (apparent) tranny leak.  mind you, i love dominic and these guys, they got class, but they always seem to be in too big a hurry, rushing, instead of taking the time and doing things right and most importantly checking their work.  confirming the repair, so-to-speak. so instead of actually checking the vacuum hose, (aka diagnosis) they write me a quote for $1100 to replace the brake booster, including $700 for the booster itself. (not a lexus booster, according to the tech i spoke with on the phone)  i can purchase a top-of-the-line, lifetime warrantied booster at napa for $330.  retail.  greenway obviously can buy it even cheaper.  so a 100+% markup?  really?  really?   declining the repairs but paying $45 for supposed ""diagnosis,"" i bring her home to do the work myself.  and what do i immediately find?  a cracked, rock-hard vacuum line to the brake booster.  $7 worth of vacuum hose later i'm good to go.   i can no longer recommend greenway to friends or family.  oh, and i'd like my $45 for ""diagnosis"" back. and whatever you charged me for twice as much atf as my lexi actually needed."
659,negative,"beware of this place! do not give them your business!!!!

i hate that you cannot rate lower than 1 star. 

we bought an altima with a dent. through negotiations they said they would fix that and a new door handle on the inside, since it was completely detached from the door. they wanted me to take it home instead of fixing it at that time. this was my first red flag, and i should have walked away. they said they will schedule an appointment and give me a loaner car. i brought it back when they scheduled an appointment a couple days later, by then the check engine light was on. when i arrived, they refused to give me a loaner car. i insisted and they gave in, but not before telling me 3 times they do not normally do this. after 14 days of having my car with multiple frustrating games of phone tag, they told me it was done and to pick it up.

i arrived to a dent free altima. i tried the door handle, that was previously detached, and it came right off. it was definitely the same handle, but now it had super glue on the broken clasps. the manager still stood by that the dealership paid for and installed that part. they told me to take it home and they would schedule another appointment. i got in the car and the check engine light was still on!! they kept the altima and gave me another loaner car. 10 days later!!! i finally get a call back that the altima is ready. i go to pick it up and decide to go straight to a mechanic. the estimate was 3k worth of work to parts that would need to be replaced to even pass emissions!!

no one would return my calls. no one! i called almost every person in management. finally the finance manager told me to come in. when i arrived at 9am the finance manager realized he couldn't(or didn't want to) help me and told me to sit and wait for someone. after about 45 minutes a sales associate i hadn't dealt with before had to listen to my story. at this point it had been 45 days since i bought the car. the guy said he was going to contact smiley, beware of this two faced character, and he would get back to me. around 1pm they had a manager i had never dealt with gave me a too bad, so sad approach to telling me they could do nothing for me. their main reason, i already had the car for 45 days. they had it for 24 of those days!!!

i ended up buying another car from them. i probably got the worst deal in the world. they bought the altima back for 3k less than what they sold to me, and the car i got was 3k more than i paid the first time. what could i do? no other dealership would have given me as much for the altima. i was forced to give van chevrolet the benefit of selling another unit. it pains me every time i think of it. i drove off the lot at 430pm. to top it off, finance screwed our registration up and we still had to make 2 trips back in the following weeks to fix other issues. i will never be back.

i commend you if you read this whole review. i left so many frustrating details out as well. you can imagine what is in store for you if you go to van chevrolet. beware!!!"
660,negative,"monroeville dodge is a joke. if you are interested in a dodge go anywhere else. my girlfriend and i went to look at a dodge dart and possibly trade in her '08 civic. when we got there we were immediately being hounded by a salesman from the second we got out of our car. the guy brought us to the second were the darts were and we looked at about 16 different vehicles. there were not any that fit our needs and wants in a car so we asked about ordering the exact car that we wanted and they were less than helpful. they told us that it was not worth ordering and that we should just drop our standards and buy from the stock that they had. we went back and forth with the salesman for at least an hour and he was still not willing to help us order the one we wanted. finally we found a vehicle that just came onto the lot that we like and we talked about trading in her civic for the dart. they wanted $23000 for the dart which was not completely loaded like it should be for that price.  they told us that they could only give her $5000 for the civic and that it wasn't worth anymore. kbb states that the car is worth $11500 which is a huge difference. i mentioned it to them and they said because it costs them a lot to put new brakes and tires on the vehicle. bullshit! it certainly does not cost $6500 to do that. needless to say we walked out of there without a new car. later that night i built the exact car she wanted on the dodge website and the total came out to $23000 with delivery, in dash gps, the under seat storage unit, automatic transmission (which costs more), bluetooth, and a sunroof. they were asking the same price for a vehicle that had half of that. i understand they need to make money but that place is a rip off and waste of time. i'd suggest going elsewhere to buy a dodge vehicle."
661,negative,i went there last month to have my a/c checked. they looked at it and said the system was fully charged and my battery was going bad. well it turns out neither was true! my truck has been starting without any problems even after a week of sitting! and my a/c was empty of refrigerant! not full as told! turns out there is another problem with the a/c. this really pisses me off because they replaced my transmission about two years ago. and then someone took the oil funnel out of the engine compartment. o didn't notice until days later. but now i'm wondering how good of a job did they actually do?! really makes me mad about how dishonest they were! they have a non rating with me at this point. never to go back!  should be a star setting for zero stars!
662,negative,"be very cautious with this business. although it has been several years, i am still really pissed of with this company. the owner is still the same, although management may be different. bought a 2003 escape, new from them, and the transmission failed at 70,000 km. implied warranty is for 170,000 km. they did not want to reimburse me for the cost of rebuilding the transmission, so i took them to civil court. the company's lawyer settled with me a week before the court date, only after i gave her a dozen cited cases concerning the implied warranty, one of them being a judgement from supreme court.

after reading an article about the sale price of a vehicle, they also charged me pdi, which was also fraudulent. please read below from amvic.

the automotive business regulation, section 11(2)(l) states that businesses must include ""[...]in the advertised price for any vehicle the total cost of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, all fees and charges such as the cost of accessories, optional equipment physically attached to the vehicle, transportation charges and any applicable taxes or administration fees, but not including gst or costs and charges associated with financing.""

examples of fees or charges that may be included in the advertised price but cannot be added on to it:

freight
pdi-pde (pre-delivery inspection/expense)
administration (admin) fee(s)
levy recoveries (amvic levy, air conditioning levy, etc.)
pre-installed products and services (nitrogen/tire protection package, security or theft deterrent products/services such as etching, etc., fuel)"
663,negative,"stay away from honda of concord service department!!!
i took my car in for a new starter and ended needing a new transmission the next day.  i've never had issues with my car and this is so disappointing.  when they requested feedback for my visit i explained in detail what happened and they said a general manager would contact me.  this was last week and i still have not heard from them!"
664,negative,"this is the absolute worst place i've ever taken my car. not only did they lie about changing the transmission fluid and almost break my car because of it. they are now refusing to give me a refund! steve the manager can take my money but doesn't know how to refund it when they are 100% in the wrong. 
i had to take my car to another shop to have them tell me not only is my transmission fluid still black it's also overfilled. they literally poured transmission fluid on top of bad fluid and told me they changed it. im not an idiot i know transmission fluid is not suppose to be black still after you pay to get it changed. 
owner can't even bother to call me back. 
warning: if you take your car here they will most likely charge you and do nothing to it and refuse to give you your money back even with proof that they messed up.  
go to roberts complete automotive in mesa, he's an honest hardworking guy that fixed my car after this shop almost broke it.

i plan on submitting a lawsuit against them if they do not refund me if anyone else on here has also been taken advantage of by them and wants to be part of a lawsuit to get your money back! please email me ayrielvon23@gmail.com"
665,negative,"spent over $700 to get the check engine light off and when i picked up the car everything seemed fine, exactly two days later the check engine light  is on once again. over paid for something they couldn't even do right and i dropped the car off with half a tank of gas and when i picked it up it was empty. i wouldn't waste time or money coming here their lot is full and they kept the car for over 3 days. they keep accepting customers when they don't have enough space or employees to fix cars."
666,negative,"stay away!!! 

on october 17th, i contacted midas to make an appointment to have my vehicle inspected as the check engine light had come on.  i also had a loose plastic cover in the undercarriage of the vehicle that needed to be re-fastened. i dropped the vehicle off at 4:25 pm. 

the following day (october 18th), i had not received any updates from midas about my vehicle. in the afternoon at 2:18 pm, i decided to give them a call myself. i spoke to a gentleman who was surprised to hear that no one had called me (as they were allegedly supposed to) and that he had bad news. i was then informed that my vehicle had been broken into, the passenger side window had been smashed, and that there was glass and my personal belongings strewn across the front seat area. the mechanic assured me that the window would be repaired.  he also mentioned that this has happened before on their lot and suggested that this would be a learning lesson for him that midas should not be accepting customer vehicles if they do not have space indoors to store them. at this time i mentioned that my ipod touch was in the vehicle, but there was no confirmation if it was there or not. i was told that i would be contacted again later that day with an update and they would be trying to have the vehicle ready by end of day. again, i received no call from midas. 

the next morning (october 19th), i again had to call midas myself for an update.  i was told that the replacement window they ordered had been dropped and broken by the delivery person and that they were awaiting another delivery.  the mechanic told me that i would be contacted when the vehicle was ready. again, no call was ever received.  i called again in the afternoon and was told that the vehicle was ready to be picked up.

upon arrival, i determined that my ipod touch was indeed missing. my partner and i were invited into the shop area to speak with two managers.  when i shared that i felt that i should receive reimbursement for my stolen contents, my partner and i were met with aggression and told that, verbatim, ""i could have told you 'screw you' and not paid for the window.""  my partner and i proceeded back to the reception area to pay the $142 diagnostic bill, obviously very upset by the experience we just had. the man then proceeded back inside as well, watching us and then added ""i checked the vehicle before, there was no ipod in there"" with a very disrespectful tone and offensive smirk, implying that i am lying. 

my partner and i paid and left the premises with my vehicle. i can now report that the window is not functioning properly - it does not close and stays stuck until the button is pressed open/close several times. 

as a result, i will never bring my vehicle for any type of service to midas again.  this has left an extremely poor taste in my mouth and i've been left in a worse situation than i was in before i brought the vehicle to midas, and out over $150. 

the behaviour exhibited by their mechanics was incredibly unprofessional, rude, and antagonistic.  they implied that it was my responsibility to not only replace my stolen contents, but that they were doing me a huge favour by replacing the window. furthermore, the expert service that was done on my vehicle is incomplete (at best).

my advice? stay very, very, very far away from midas at 769 bathurst street, toronto."
