60,positive,"found this shop online searching and saw the great reviews here on yelp. brought in my 2010 f-150 raptor because my flowmasters were too obnoxiously loud at highway speeds, too much cabin drone. they are installing a magnaflow muffler and piping right now. super happy with the service and price. definitely will come back for future work!!"
61,positive,"first, when you walk in, you'll notice the place just looks and feels so much cleaner than most auto-shops. denelle i think is her name works the front desk, she was great, and she guessed my car's issue right just from my sound impersonation, hah! they checked it out while changing my oil, sure enough, same thing my other mechanic said. i had a coupon for a $20 oil change, but that is for regular oil and mine takes synthetic. they double checked that it can't take regular, and again, i know my usual guy uses synthetic as well, but to make it up they gave me the same $10 off the usual synthetic price, $60, which is exactly what i usually pay, so total was $50...and they checked my fluids, check engine light issue, as well as confirming the noise is the power steering pump. but what put it over the top was a mailed thank you note, signed by them. ok, i love my mechanic, but these guys are my new go-to for routine stuff. second opinions, and possibly big jobs if i want to make sure it's done well."
62,positive,"i came here to buy transmission oil and had no clue what i was doing. the sales associate actually checked my transmission level and found out i didn't even need it, and then helped me pick out new windshield wipers. he even offered to put the wipers on since i think he could tell that i was clueless. 

will definitely come back."
63,positive,"i recently had my car repaired at wolbert's.  i had some deep scratches, dents and a major crunch in the front end.  they did a fantastic 'bang up' job, and my car looks brand new!  if i could give them ten stars, i would.  i highly recommend them!!"
64,positive,"took our car into a different shop to get the transmission fluid flushed because they charged a decent price. we go to pick up the car and they tell us we need all new brake pads and two new front rotors. i ask how much and the guy says $650 plus tax. i had to pick my jaw up from the ground. i was recommended to choice auto repair by my dad and am so thankful i was!! kevin was able to get us in first thing the next day. he called and informed us that only the front brake pads needed to be replaced and that he could resurface the front two rotors instead of replacing them. the grand total was $150 plus tax. this shop is awesome, i will never take any of my cars anywhere else. i really do appreciate their honesty and fair prices."
65,positive,"i stopped in to relax a minute, after having my car repaired.  i ordered the carmel macchiato which i thoroughly enjoyed. i really liked the long community table, i met and chatted with some very friendly people from in and out of town.  sure, the parking is cramped and the lot sucks, but i didn't come for that, i came for the coffee  and good service, which was spot on.  thanks starbucks."
66,positive,the best hands down for all your transmission needs! we are repeat customers and will always go here first rather than waist our time anywhere else. super customer service!
67,positive,"hands down the most honest service shop. 

i have a warranty with car max and my transmission has been funky ever since i got the darn car. it's only 3 years old (18 months i've had it) and it's never running correctly. i called carmax and of course they wanted to charge me $200 just to see it and the wait was two weeks to get an appointment. what da heck?! so i asked if i could get a rental til then and they said no, not til they say somethings wrong with it. soooo, let me get this straight.. i'm supposed to drive a car that keeps dying on me while driving with two small kids in 110 degree weather.. wow. 

sorry, getting to the point... 
so the warranty people recommend this place and i call. the gentleman on the phone was completely sweet, understanding and got me in the next day. i left my car there at 8am and when i picked it up he said it is skipping but not enough for the warranty to replace it and for now to be careful.. it may also just be bad gasoline. i knew that they looked at it so i had to pay the $80 inspection fee (as states on my warranty) and he was sweet and told me no they were waiving it since nothing was technically wrong. 

from start to finish i cannot explain how easy, simple, sweet and efficient they were. i will always go to them first with my business."
68,positive,"i was referred to tony's by a napa warranty agent and quickly read their reviews. after feeling comfortable, i called them up and booked an appointment for the next day. upon arriving, i was promptly greeted and made aware upfront that i would have a long wait time based on the repair i needed done. about 45 minutes later, tony informed me that my repair was going to be pricey. instead of him being money hungry, he talked with me and gave me his opinion...the repair would be more expensive than my car was worth and he didn't think it would be worth it. that could've been the end, however, he went the extra mile to escort me to a dealership and put me in trusted hands. thanks to tony i was able to trade in my car and get a 2016 chevy cruze for an amazing price and he even went on a test drive with me to ensure i was satisfied with the purchase. tony is the definition of a stand up guy and deserves everything good that comes his way. i didn't have the pleasure of getting my car repaired by him, but i will refer him to everyone i come across and will return if i ever need anything. he's honest, charismatic, and a great business man!"
69,positive,"there's a reason it helps to get an appointment for service at bell union auto service -- the word is out about how great this place is! 

ken and the staff here are the real deal, honest, friendly,and they know what to do to fix it right. i had some check engine light issues and other warnings for service and it was time for maintenance on my liberty. with 112,000miles, i anticipated the worst but they put everything right and included it all in the usual service rate, a fraction of the cost to visit a dealer. 

what i discovered is that they do only what is necessary -- no inflated charges -- no cashing in at my expense. i've tried the ""jiffy"" coupons and ""gruupy"" deals only to find they are simply looking to up charge for added unneeded services. recently moved to grayhawk and have been looking for an auto service i could really trust. so glad to have found bell union!"
70,positive,"had to take my altima in for a recall. service staff was super helpful and friendly. they hooked me up with an uber to and from the place which was super easy to use. i did have to pay $225 for transmission fluid change on my ctv tranny, which seemed like a lot, but the parts guy gave me a free touch up paint for a scratch so that was cool. car cane back nice and clean. no complaints."
71,positive,super service! t&m is probably the most honest auto shop in vegas. they do great work whether its a transmission to changing the emission controls. i can't say enough and i can say that from experience as i worked in the auto repair business years ago while going to college.
72,positive,"i am pleased to update the fact that brian, the current owner of buddy's auto repair, has made things right. a couple of weeks ago i received a call and email from brian about my experience and his desire to rectify what happened. it was just in time too, as my check engine light had been coming on an off. so, i took my truck in and was given a very thorough diagnostic exam for free. i ended up needing new plugs and sparks, along with a duct valve and buddy's replaced all of that for $100. additionally, they made sure that the loaner car had a full tank of gas. i am very happy and will, for sure, reach out to buddy's in the future. i appreciate brian's actions!"
73,positive,brandon was awesome! he was able to do a code check for our check engine light. unfortunately we have to take it to a speciality mechanic. we appreciated brandon's superb customer service & his honesty.
74,positive,"excellent service. great and honest people... got my engine oil, manual transmission and transaxle gear lube, transfer case lubricant, brake/clutch fluid and power steering fluid done today. great price compared to tireworks, sears and the over rated auto pro shop. joe who is the office, made me feel welcome. al the mechanic did a great job. thanks a whole lot to tiffany bautista-medeiros for the help. highly recommend people to go excel... great honest people, overall great company... will return for routine maintenance for my evo 9..."
75,positive,"so, i'll start this off by saying that no one ever likes to get their car repaired...especially in arizona...and certainly when that repair is associated with the ac. knowing full well the potential cost of the repairs, i approached my search for a repair shop with caution. 

tj and the guys at kinkade's were super awesome. tj shot me a quote within the hour with two possible costs depending on how bad the ac was. come to find out, it was the dreaded compressor that had gone out. tj gave me options, letting me know what he recommended, but not pushing needless repairs on an already expensive situation. he was straight up and forward, and i am glad he was. my wife and two boys are now riding in a nice refrigerated chariot, facing these nasty summer temps. 

i will certainly be going back if i need anything else repaired. they made a painful situation very bearable."
76,positive,these guys made a terrible experience bearable during my last trip through las vegas. my transmission on my truck went out while towing my travel trailer through las vegas. chris was extremely helpful. he tried to look for cost saving options for me and the work was done extremely fast.
77,positive,richards auto clinic was great! i dropped my jeep off that had been having issues for several months. previously another mechanic had said that he couldn't figure out why my check engine light was on and that it was something i would just have to live with. my car was at richards for only 2 days before he called with great news. he fixed all the issues that i was having in a timely manner and at a reasonable price. even better- after asking if he had a military discount he gave me 10% off! definitely head to this place if you are in the area.
78,positive,"who in the world can actually brag about having an amazing mechanic? i can. 

bob is the real deal. my family has taken a veritable fleet of cars to him over the past decade--hondas, toyotas, mazdas, and a mid-90s pos nissan. he has helped us with everything from the mundane (window switches, antennas) to the crucial (brakes, transmissions, a/c). his work ethic is unparalleled and he has gone above and beyond for us more times than we could count.

tip: don't complain if you find a lone cat sleeping in your back seat when you go to pick your car. it's part of the experience!  

they don't make 'em like this anymore, folks."
79,positive,"we just brought our car there to be taken care of. we were told by another auto place that we needed our brakes done and the transmission fluid done. well we didn't and thank you the t & m automotive for being honest. never again will we take our vehicles to ""convenience"" places for oil changes and such. it's just not worth it. our vehicles will only be coming here from now on!!"
80,positive,"i just had my car repaired with i-17 collision. i am very thankful for the repair work done on my mazda. you can not tell there was any damage donethe paint matches perfectly, the staff was efficient, courteous, and very skilled.  my mechanic recommended me to this shop for the body repair and i can see why. they are experts! my thanks to xavier, rose, and the entire staff."
81,positive,"very pleased with my service.  had a transmission leak repaired, broken windshield replaced, oil changed, smog certed and they had a tow truck pick it up from my home and add it to my bill so i didn't have to worry about it!  friendly, professional, reasonable, and convenient:  a rare find in automotive repair!"
82,positive,"brought my car in because check engine light was on. they were honest and upfront about the issues it could be. they explained all my options and even said they'd give me references because it was outside of the scope of work that they offer. being a woman, it's refreshing to go to a place that isn't going to try and take advantage. they were all very knowledgeable and educated me on the issue with my car."
83,positive,"hamid reached out to me and his customer service skills alone deserve the five stars. he has advised that he will be retraining staff members and seeking out for qualified technicians.  

 his comment back is incorrect regarding how many times i have visited, but that is probably due to my last name changing. 

overall i am now satisfied with their service and i trust hamid so that is what matters. 

---------original review was one star and comments below


this place is appealing due to their high positive reviews and free cookies, which sold me even after they messed up on my car once before. it's hard finding a good mechanic and i figured maybe they were having a off day. 

long story short twice they have repaired the wrong thing (tail light issues) which was fine with me since i caught it and they didn't try to charge me for the piece i didn't need. but what scares me is they also did work on my engine which is not so easily visible as a tail light. and now my check engine light is on.. eeeekkk. 

i told the mechanic ""i don't  know how you have such great reviews."" and he replied ""well i'm actually a aircraft mechanic"" .. um is that suppose to explain why you couldn't read my dashboard to know which tail light to replace or is that your way of saying you are above being a car mechanic?! 

the gentlemen at the front desk handled the situation very well but unfortunately they can't duplicate ten more of him. 

sorry for the bad review but you need to hire better mechanics."
84,positive,"these guys are insane.  again i thought i needed a ton of unnecessary things done on my car... and 25th street auto talked me out of them.  i was going to do a complete tear out and screen and gasket replacement in my transmission and bill told me it was not needed and costly.  i think we need to call in the guys with the straight jackets!

again a great motor and transmission oil change... and then found a tiny leak in my steering fluid that i will keep an eye on."
85,positive,"the staff members at audi chandler are some of the friendliest i've interacted with, from the salespeople to the financing department. i'd been kicking around the idea of getting an audi as we needed to trade up from my compact hatchback to a car that can transport more than 2 people comfortably. i was interested in an a4 or an a5, and knew that audi chandler had a manual transmission a4 on the lot. i walked in on a friday with about 15-20 minutes of free time before dinner and worked with jorge to take a look at the interior and exterior of the two models. before i left, i told jorge that i would likely be back in on saturday or sunday for a test drive and he didn't pressure me at all.

i came back on sunday and worked with adora (turns out, jorge wasn't working that day) and she let me test drive the manual a4 as well as an automatic a4 with no problems. i wasn't expecting to walk out on sunday with an audi, but adora worked with me to get the deal i was looking for and that was that.

the whole process was pretty painless and i really didn't feel pressured, cornered, intimidated, uncomfortable, etc. throughout the better part of my afternoon. nobody likes to spend the whole day at the dealership, but if i had to choose one, this would be a good choice."
86,positive,"i was so pleasantly surprised by the menu at padres after being sent there by the volkswagon service department up the road.  i was driving cross country with my boyfriend when the check engine light came on so we had to stop and it was just in time for lunch.

we ordered guacamole and chips which came with three types of salsa.  i had the palin salmon salad, which was cooked just right and had a perfect amount of mexican seasoning for a salad dish.  my boyfriend got the obama burrito, which was extremely tasty and huge!

all i can say is, i wish padres was near where i live now!"
87,positive,"hold onto your hats....ill try not to make this too lengthy.
soooo took my car in for check engine light.  they called, explained what the (at the time) problem was and recommended some other things.  ok how much?  oh boy.  oh well. get it done!
marco was kind enough to drop me off at work (thanks marco) and pick me up as well.  
get my car, things are running smoothly.  friday got off early, was going to stop at the casino to put in a bet and boom....wouldn't you know it.  check engine light is back on.  (guess i wasn't supposed to bet that day lol) i called and they said bring it in.  they ran another diagnostic.  this time the throttle body or something was bad.  they tried to clean it to save me some money but that did not work.  actually the cleaning made it worse.  they kept my car and offered me a loaner car (thanks again).  they had my car all weekend and finally tuesday night they called to tell me it was ready.  i had just met my family from out of town for dinner so i said i will swing by in the am.  got my car wednesday am.  work is literally 6 minutes down the road so i didn't get to give it a good test run.  thursday, car running great.  friday (personal time taken off to be w the fam) i hop in to go and meet the fam at dad's timeshare and 10 minutes into the car ride........here we go again w the check engine.  this time....thermostat.  lordy, i'm broke now.  hell i was broke before but now i'm really really broke lol.
marco made sure to bring me back to show me the reading on the machine reader for the code (appreciate ya).
it's been 5 1/2 days and so far we are looking good.  jack even called yesterday to see how everything was going.  
now....let's be clear.  the check engine light repeatedly coming on had nothing to do with the work that they had performed.  each time it was something different.  i was confused, like why won't it just give all the codes at once but jack and marco patiently explained to me that it just doesn't work that way, especially for older cars.  i've trusted this place since i first met hamid and now dealing with marco and jack for what was every other day, i trust them as well.
fellas and the mechanic that worked hard on my car, i appreciate you!  thank you for being patient with my frustrations and my confusion and thank you so much for working with me!
hope to not see you anytime soon lol."
88,positive,"the service department is amazing.  they came out to greet me before i had even stopped my car.  this was in the middle of summer (july 2017) and it was not pleasant outside.  they collected the information they needed from the car extremely quickly (odometer reading, etc) and i was ushered inside in under two minutes.  

the 2015 subaru wrx i brought in for a repair was having an issue with the cvt (bad choice) transmission was slipping and having rough shifting.  it was an intermittent problem.  the service manager and i went on a test drive but the problem didn't occur this time.  he sent it back to the service department regardless.  they researched the problem and found a software update for the transmission.  it took a while because they had to let the transmission cool down first before they could apply the update.  this was not a problem because their waiting room is amazing.  i swear their kitchen is nicer than most people's homes and it's really a pleasant place to wait.  giant 75 inch tv's and leather chairs made it easy to spend an hour while they performed the update.  

subaru of america was terrific as well, as my car was technically out of warranty by nearly 2000 miles but they performed the update for free regardless!  i was very impressed.  the software update was successful.  so far i have not encountered the issue again, but it's only been a day since the update was applied.  

i can't speak for the sales department.

the service department is terrific.  10/10 across the board.  keep up the good work."
89,positive,"friendly neighborhood car repair. i've had my brakes serviced, oil changes, and transmission service. sometimes there are deals on groupon for car services, and it doesn't hurt to call and ask them to honor the price without purchasing the groupon! i always get my car back in a timely manner, and i appreciate the rides home! located just north of cactus on cave creek road, on the east side of the street, across from home depot."
90,positive,"had the compustar r3 2-way installed on my manual transmission impreza. i usually do my own mechanical maintenance but electrical stuff is a bit beyond my expertise. with that said, i wanted someone experienced installing remote engine start on my brand new car. kyle knows the product like the back of his hand and performs a ""clean"" install using soldering of wires instead of crimping where it is a less reliable connection. i'm really glad i got this installed since i just moved to the area and getting used to my first midwest winter. will be coming back in the summer for a tint install!"
91,positive,"once again, amazing service! lee and the guys are always so friendly and welcoming there and they take the time to explain what needs to be done. i went in for a smog check and see why my check engine light was on so i can get my registration renewed. they were able to diagnose, order and fix everything in less than 2 days while keeping me updated on the process. it also came out much less than i expected :) i will refer them to anyone! thanks again rebel!"
92,positive,"yesterday i needed my car diagnosed for a iac issue. when i initially called i was stressed out and not very nice but they listened and told me to come over. they brought my car right back and ran a few tests. i dealt with bill, lorenzo, and mike. my car needs more tests because it's not throwing a code and the check engine light isn't going on. i'm usually very good at diagnosing my car and these guys did not dismiss me. i apologized for being rude and lorenzo asked me if i was okay. i broke down into tears and i got a hug. it was certain a bad day! i'll be back on monday. lorenzo listened to me and gave me a sympathetic ear. having car problems at this point in time is the least of my troubles buts nice to know that you have good, honest, mechanics that are there to help and actually care! they will always have my business! they will drive me home when i drop my car off as they have done on the past and will update me on the progress of the tests. the plan is to hook up a computer to my vehicle and drive it to catch the issue. if you need someone who will treat you right go see these guys. i know they are like this at every location as i have had to have my tires checked at a few others. i'm in outbound sales and drive a lot. trustworthy and transparent are the 2 most important words i can think of with this company."
93,positive,"my car is a 1955 buick special, the transmission was leaking badly that i couldn't be able to drive my car for months. the gaskets were 60 years old as worn out. the transmission works fine even with heavy leaking. i took my car to buster, and he was very honest and reasonable price to have it fixed. buster double check inside of transmission to ensure if it needs to be rebuild. he says it is in very good condition as don't need to rebuild. he put new gaskets to stop the leakage. i m amazed at his skills and get things done in time. i would recommend him to any classic or modern cars to be repair. he is the man!"
94,positive,"let start off by saying i live at scottsdale and shea and drive to 32nd street and greenway to go to community tire pros.  ron and mike are fantastic!.  there isn't a more honest group of guys around!  

the car's transmission was slipping so we took it in to them to take a look at it.  they did and the total come to $8,500 to fix it.  now for the good part, ron did some additional research on the problem.  he had scoured the internet and also called friend who worked for volvo in town to confirm what he learned.  it was a known issue for volvo's and the manufacturer might give us some relief on it.  

we picked up the car and took it to volvo to get it looked at.  they came back with the same problem as community tire.  same price as well.  but the service rep offered to go to volvo to get me some help to pay for it.  volvo offered to pay for half.  prior to the car getting fixed i went over all the repairs volvo said needed fixed with ron at community tire to verify them and volvo fixed the car.  now we are back on the road.  

i just want to point out the they did the best for me, not them.  not only was i advised on how to get a better deal, ron also took additional time with me to make sure the fix was right.  they didn't get paid for any of this.  they did the right thing for me.  

i can't say more than this - they will continue to be my auto repair of choice and i will refer all my friends there."
95,positive,"james rocks!!! had a problem with emissions, went into here as the are right by me. james told me to come in the next day and we slapped some cats on no problem. i passed emissions no problem. prices are good, workmanship is great. this is not a huge shop, they can be busy at times, but their work is great. i've found my new muffler shop."
96,positive,"first time at mb motors based upon yelpers' recommendations.  normally, i would go to the dealership and then cry on the way home after seeing the bill.  gave these people a chance when my mercedes had a noise and then showed the check engine light.  i am a cautious person so i was not driving the car with that light on without having a mechanic check it out.  spoke to jamie who assured me i could drive it in because it might be spark plugs or something to do with emissions.  as soon as i drove in, bud, the mechanic/owner identified the noise as having to do with the power steering. good hearing, experience, or both?  the problem was identified and after i picked up the next day, my car was driving beautiful with no noise and no ""check engine"" light.   i always wish my car repair bill was lower but considering that they also did some brake maintenance work as well,  i think the price would have been significantly higher at the dealership.  
it was also a nice place to be people-wise.  jamie, was very nice and professional.  she also did me a big favor of driving me to a place to eat considering that the pickings are slim in their ""iffy""neighborhood.  super cool young lady.  thanks. jamie."
97,positive,"i use their specialty (exhaust) many times over the years.  
they were in a small complex at dorval st, near speedy glass.

later, they move to this new address and i have been there one time.  
still, their service is very very good and reasonable too.  very courteous, just good honest people with good management.
 
it is definitely my top go to place for mufflers.  wish there are many more of these places these days."
98,positive,great place to get your car repaired. they are very trustworthy and very thorough. tj the owner is a great guy and will take the time to explain things to you. there are a few things i would caution people about but it's nothing too serious. they have longer then most wait times but once again they are very thorough and they will offer you a free ride home. they are not for early risers. their doors open up between the hours of 0830 and 0945 and it could be later. also when booking an appointment be advised that it will likely be a week out. those are just somethings to know but overall it's a great place and i still encourage people to give em a go.
99,positive,"i was a referral from decatur mercedes-benz auto repair so,i had these guys investigate why my 95 tahoe work truck was dogging out so bad and i had a hunch it had to do with the exhaust,the owner thought that maybe my catalytic converter might be clogged or the muffler baffles were broken, especially since i have a quarter million miles on the truck. anyway i just had him replace the catalytic converter and muffler and its perfect.  the problem ended up being the baffles in the muffler were broken out and causing low flow. anyway i have no complaints and i don't think these guys racially profile so don't worry about that review.
i also run a automotive type business and it's really nice to run across a company that's competent to do the work and confident at the same time. you guys at performance rock, thank you, mike"
100,positive,i can't believe what a true pleasure it was to actually get me car repaired. i was given a time slot that worked best with my schedule and was in and out in a shorter than anticipated time. my car was maintained in a professional manner and all service people were so friendly. this is my 2nd maxima and their service is a main reason i'm a repeat customer.
101,positive,"i have a late model chevy tahoe, i needed a custom dual exhaust  which i was quoted as much as $550 from other shops... i have paid upwards of $400 on other custom exhausts for my previous vehicles. (not done at allstar)

i received this custom dual exhaust from the catalytic converter back for only $200!!!! ( i had my own flowmaster muffler i purchased from summit racing) the welds are clean, hangers fitted in the ""right"" places, 2 yr warranty (since its custom), good communication and customer service. best quality best price hands down!

only downside is they left a door open while they did the exhaust which killed my battery, they were quick to give me a jump and it charged back up with no problems...hey no ones perfect, and i understand that sh** happens!! no harm no folly!!"
102,positive,"i'm always nervous to go to mechanics because you always think the mechanics are going to lie to you just to take all your money. but i've been going to this blue diamond location the 2 years i've lived in vegas because they are honest, hard working, friendly mechanics here that are willing to explain and show you whenever your car is in trouble. the first time i went here was for a simple break replacement.. i usually go shopping while i wait for my car (which is another plus about this location) so as i was browsing ross one of the employees (i believe he was manager at the time) called me and told me while they were rotating my routers they noticed heat spots or something that was not good.. i kind of panicked and asked if i could see because i was scared of getting ripped off. so they told me to come back so they could show me before they replaced it for me.. in the end they were so helpful and nice that day i kept going back. i get my oil changed regularly here and they help me to upkeep my car for perfect running conditions.. even when they told me my transmission fluid should be changed i wasn't sure but they were happy to dip a test strip in the transmission fluid and show me it should be changed. also jim the manager is so nice and understanding. i always feel like i understand more about my car everytime i visit. thank you guys for being amazing at what you do!"
103,positive,"it's hard to be impressed when you go in to a place for a simple oil change but the employees at econo lube in green valley thoroughly impressed me. i took my nissan in for a basic oil change before my road trip. i normally go to jiffy lube and because i have an suv i end up paying around $50 when i walk out but at econo lube i paid about $30 and got the best service i've ever had. they topped everything off, looked at by brakes, rotated my tires and did a diagnostic check of a check engine light that kept popping up. i also appreciated the fact that they did not try to ""up sell"" the oil change, they kept it sweet and simple and because ""i'm just a girl"" they didn't try and tell me i needed to overhaul my engine ;-). i dealt with john who is the manager and he was super nice and helpful. the only negative thing i can say is that their lobby is tiny but then again aren't all oil service places??

side note: when i was there a former employee went to have his car serviced simultaneously and the general consensus was this was the best place in town to have your car serviced for minor things."
104,positive,"i gave this place 5 stars because i can't give it 10! i first found out about this place about 13 years ago when i met paul the manager at my place of employment.  shortly after i had a problem with a vehicle, i knew it was going to be expensive but i didn't know who to trust.  i told paul about the problem and he said that him and his staff could help.  my first thought was ""don't these guys just do brakes, i need transmission work?""  ultimately my transmission was fixed in a timely manner, fixed properly and at a fair price.  

since that time i have taken 4 of my other personal vehicles there. i have 4 co-workers who only take their vehicles here. my current vehicle is a toyota with free 24 month/2 year maintenance and an i still went here and paid! i've taken my girlfriends car here and she's referred 2 of her friends.  all of these people feel they were treated properly and given a fair price.  all of them plan to return if/when they have any vehicle service needs.  i take great pride in being able to send customers and friends to an honest and fair garage. 

paul gives you an honest assessment of what you need and tells you what can wait if your financially strapped and tells you what needs to be fixed right away.  i have stood and watched el work on my car and he's amazing! i don't even mind staying while my car is being worked on. i have even stayed and ate lunch with them twice. this place rocks!"
105,positive,"great crew here at performance mufflers shop. they took their time to make sure it was done right. very reasonable price. joe was great , he was able to get me in without appointment. definitely coming back for future customization/ repair needs."
106,positive,"the manager at this location, roc, was very friendly. he took the time to explain not only what needed to be done but also functionalities of the parts that needed to be serviced. the check engine light was on and before spending thousands of dollars to get the problem fixed at their shop, they did have us check the warranty on the car first. the service was quick and honest. they looked for problems that wouldn't be the most expensive, where as most places would have just ripped me off. roc and his team did not do this. they took our concerns very seriously and kept us updated on our vehicle. when one thing didn't work they kept moving along until the problem was found, agaim starting at what would cost the least to fix and working up. i appreciated that all the work done was in the same day and that even as more costumers came in our car wasn't put aside. 
in my visit, i saw that they were very accommodating to the needs of their costumers. roc was very forward about costs and time of services. 
we will continue to use this location and business for all of our auto needs. i would recommend this place to my family and friends."
107,positive,"first time doing business with all pro. offered free towing to pick our car up from our home. were very thorough in making sure it was not a transmission problem and even towed our car for free to brake masters so we could find the problem (which we did). they made sure to make the process as easy as possible. very nice guy, and  although we didn't end up having any actual work done on our vehicle, the diagnostic price was more than fair. he went above and beyond to accommodate our hectic schedule."
108,positive,"we were traveling from henderson, nv to southern arizona when our check engine light came on. we were close to casa grande, so we took our cadillac suv to auto zone to have the code read. we found out the problem and promptly went to gmc since there wasn't a cadillac dealer there. we explained to them that we were traveling with our 94 year-old grandfather when they told us they couldn't fit us in that day. once they heard that, they did everything they could to try and accommodate us. they were, unfortunately, able to fit us in, but they found the repair was still covered under our power train warranty. i called cadillac in tucson. they were going to be closing soon (this was about 3:00pm), and said they couldn't do it that day. since the nice service guys at gmc told us we were still warrantied, i asked cadillac if we could get s loaner until we came back through tucson in a couple of days. once i asked him that, he decided to hold a service guy late so they could perform the repairs as soon as we got there! had we not found out we were under warranty, repairs would not have happened that day!! we are very thankful!!"
109,positive,needed some mufflers installed on my mustang.  they got me in and out in an hour for a great price.  place is not much to look at but they know their stuff and i'm happy.
110,positive,this is the second time i have taken my trucks to busters transmission service and once again they did miracles long story short this is a 2001 chevy 1500 z 71 which the transmission decided to grenade itself it was so bad that it basically threw all of the gears except first so i decided once again i will send my truck to dan at busters transmission well he made it happen. he not only completely rebuilt my transmission he made it better i am extremely pleased and also they didn't just fix my transmission they fix the brakes on the truck as well they locked up and broke and they replaced everything and fixed it for me again if you need a good transmission service and all-around great mechanics you need to bring your truck or car to them they will take care of you and will help you out anyway that they possibly can thank you guys at busters transmission service again for a great job
111,positive,"perfect location on the right side of south blvd. for my daily commute. now you can order online, pay with paypal and pick up in the store for a swift transaction. in addition, they seem to always have coupons and deals for 15-20% off for online orders. i highly recommend going this route.

the store is well stocked with the basics for auto repair in your own driveway. tools including socket sets, spark plugs, new batteries, aftermarket air intakes, muffler tips. accessories including license plate borders, sticker letters/numbers if you want to make your camry a 4x4 or make your f150 a camry, seat and steering wheel covers, novelty valve stem caps, etc.

staff is friendly and helpful. you can get your battery checked and of course replaced if necessary. it doesn't seem to me that they rig their machine to give a bad reading in their favor. they'll also help you install your newly purchased windshield wipers. good shop for all those general auto-owner needs!"
112,positive,"i couldn't find #1 transmission here on yelp but felt it was important to add it! if you look at the google reviews you will find them at 4.9 star rating with lots of great reviews. 
my transmission went out on my 2007 camry and with money being quite a huge issue as i'm on a fixed income (but aren't we all!) i had several options to choose from, and with a brand new transmission being quoted at $4229 on a 10+ year old car i didn't think that was the way for me to go. i got quotes from several places to rebuild, & to drop in a used tranny w/60,000 miles.. prices ranged but mario gave me a good price w/warranty of 12mos/12,000 miles. which was also the going ""rate"" from other places however mario was much more helpful than the other places, he also allowed someone to call in credit card info to pay for it where other places would not do! which was my saving grace! 

my car was done for a good price, service was above others, and car was done when they said it would be done! i'll be bringing my car here for all future repairs as they aren't just a transmission repair they do
all automotive repairs/service and for a fair price!! mario quoted me some other things that i need to have done & it was over $50 cheaper than purrfect auto- which has terrible reviews and it's also where i pulled my car from originally! their quoted price for tranny repair went up $100 every time i spoke to them! 
so thank you mario you were wonderful & very patient with me!"
113,positive,"i had my 1971 ford f250 brought in on crutches. it wouldn't start and transmission seemed to act funny prior to that. made an appointment with brad. jeff who did the work was very busy but he did get to it. after the initial troubleshooting with compression tests it was brought to my attention that two cylinders were misfiring badly. the diagnosis was it might need a engine overhaul or new one with estimate north of $1500. i was very nervous and brad must have felt this because the next call was the following day. after looking underneath the valve covers, jeff found one bent push rod, carburetor fuel /air was out of adjustment, bad fuel pump, bad main gas tank (auxilllary ok) which explained the odd behavior of the transmission. jeff fixed all the problems except the gas tank. it is filled with crap and i will probably have it replaced. i stress your mechanics are just people too, especially when they've been dealing with a problem child before yours. give them some room to figure it out and you will be glad you did. i gladly, paid $460 cash for a great job. my truck passed emissions that weekend and it even runs better than it did before it stopped. the shop is kind of hidden next to another shop and needs a bigger building or sign. thank you guys!"
114,positive,we went to joes by chance. we were actually on our way to another shop when our check engine light started flashing so we immediately pulled into the closest place which was joes. the guy who helped us was really nice and they took care of the issue. not sure how their prices compare since we didn't really have an option to shop around but it didn't seem too bad for everything they had to do to get the truck running. would definitely go back.
115,positive,"these guys are great! 

when the owner of this business left his previous location to work for himself (was working at one of the big chains previously), i happily started getting my oil changed here... and more!!

i own old vehicles. kris is an honest guy and he actually told me to stop spending money on one of my vehicles! he knew that the new replacement truck i got would mean i'd only need him for oil changes instead of coming through every few months to fix the next thing that died on my old truck. now that's an honest auto guy. 

i have always found them friendly and helpful, but their knowledge, expertise, honesty, and great work ethic is what really keeps me coming back and referring my friends. 

i can't believe that i had never left them a review and that no one else had (other than 1 person who apparently found them on their lunch break?)

from oil changes to transmission repair, you will not regret checking these guys out! really!

can you tell i'm impressed!?"
116,positive,"i read the reviews on here and decided that it was time to give ron's a shot.  i stopped in on veteran's day to get my oil changed. met jasen was very impressed by his professional attitude.  after my oil change was complete, jasen took me out to my car and explained that it might be time to do the transmission fluid change.  i agreed to the $150 service and waited for it to be done.  i paid a total of around $180 and went home satisfied.  i noticed a drop of oil in my driveway when i got home but thought it was just residual oil from the service.  friday evening, i notice that my car has left a puddle of oil\fluid in my garage.  i immediately went inside, scheduled an appointment online for saturday morning and intended on going in at 8.  jasen got my appointment request and called me friday night to confirm the issue and have me bring it in.  saturday morning i arrive at 8 and am greeted by staff who take my car right back.  moments later, i meet ron (owner) who was very friendly and explained what happened - the tech accidently overfilled my transmission fluid and it was leaking.  ron and his tech installed the proper amount of transmission fluid, power washed the bottom of my car and provided me with a coupon for a free car wash.  the big surprise was when ron handed me a check for the original $180 i had paid - i was shocked.  ron even offered to come to my house and power wash my driveway because of the mistake.  couldn't help but to be impressed by the service i received and though a mistake was made, the staff went above and beyond to make it right.  i have every intention of taking my vehicle back to ron's and suggesting them to friends\family.  i fully expected to have to haggle them on the repair but that never happened - ron stated that ""this isn't the way we do business"" and i certainly believe it.  thanks ron, jasen and staff for making it right and earning a customer for life."
117,positive,"munich motors is the best. top quality work, good prices and zero bs!  they have done work on my e30 and e36 m3. these guys know what they are doing, they have saved me time and money because of their expert level of knowledge. if you're buying a used bmw take it to them for a pre purchase inspection...for a small fee they take just about all of the risk out of buying privately owned bmw and mercedes benzs. plus they have a pre owned lot of really clean cars. now they are working on a 5 speed manual transmission swap for me and i have no doubt that it is gonna be perfect. i'll update when i get the car back,  i wouldn't even attempt a job like this with any other shops. but munich motors has my full trust and respect. and i don't trust anyone without out them earning it. i've been a german car enthusiast for over 15 years. i've worked in the industry as starmark lot manager, and a gopher for several mb, bmw dealerships. i'm thoroughly impressed and will continue to give them top notch reviews because they have earned that respect. give them a chance and i can damn near guarantee you will be satisfied and then some. best bmw/benz shop in phoenix."
118,positive,"my check engine light was on, so i brought it in to see what was going on. turns out, since my car is from ca, it was on because it would have failed the smog test. since arizona has no smog test, which they told me, i didn't need to get it fixed. it would have required replacing the parts responsible for the smog test, about $750 each, but since i'm not going to california, they said i didn't have to do the repair if i didn't want to. they only billed me for the labor costs, and that was very cheap at just $50. i highly recommend you go to this place for repairs or even to just see what's up with your car."
119,positive,"i have so many good things to say about my experiences here i don't know where to begin.  i bought my sportwagen tdi from camelback vw because that dealership was affiliated with costco.  i got a good price, but the experience was unpleasant and my first service experience there was catastrophically bad, causing me to seek out another dealership.  

to date, vw north scottsdale has performed the 10k, 20k, 30k, 40k, and dsg service on my car, as well as some warranty work.  each experience has been phenomenal.  tom radtke is my service rep, and he is awesome.  there's no other way to say it.  he is super pleasant to speak with, has great follow through and communication, and actually listens to what i tell him about my car.  you will never be disappointed with tom.

to give a little context to my review:  i had an audi and a mercedes before my vw, and the level of service offered by tom and vw north scottsdale eclipses that of the nearby audi and mercedes dealerships.  i consider myself car enthusiast and i historically do most of the work on my cars myself (timing belt changes, control arm replacements, brake jobs, transmission services, etc.).  i know my way around a car and i know when something is not working correctly.  

the typical experience when you present a car problem to a dealer or independent is dismissal, unless it is something completely obvious, like a front end collision.  if it is a complaint that the service provider is not familiar with, you are dismissed as paranoid or irrational.  for example, i had an issue with my car shortly after purchase and had it towed to camelback vw.  i was subsequently treated with condescension and mockery, and charged nearly $300 to fix the problem.  recently, tom and his crew diagnosed this very same problem as a warranty issue and fixed it, at no cost to me.  it was a completely different experience.

i initially brought my car to the vw dealership because the first three services are free.  i continue to take my car to tom at vw north scottsdale and pay for it because they do such a fantastic job.  vw north scottsdale presents such good value and makes the service experience so pleasant i would now prefer to pay them to service my car rather than do the work myself.

tom has always been my contact at vw north scottsdale and i cannot say enough good things about him, but i also want to say his crew who does the actual work on the car is awesome too.  collectively, they make a great team."
120,positive,"amazing!!! this muffler shop is very good. they are clean, friendly and professional. i had some custom piping done and added a resonator to a bolt on exhaust that was just too loud.  when they were done it looked like i bought it that way. i found this place because a neighbor recommended them to me. now i am recommending them to all. they get very busy though so i recommend calling for an appointment."
121,positive,"we hit a hunk of metal something-or-other on an interstate exit ramp that left the car sounding like the muffler had been punctured. the fellow at this meineke location squeezed us in without an appointment, called soon after to report a couple of broken clamps, and for about $170, we were on our way again. our fears of them ""sticking it"" to a couple of out-of-owners were completely unfounded. if they do such good work this fairly for strangers, i would have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone lucky enough to live in their neighborhood."
122,positive,"we've been to buddys twice now. once for an engine replacement. we called several places, and we got quotes for double what buddys quoted us. we did get a used engine but we discussed this in length with jason and decided it was the best option for us. the car ran great for months until the check engine light went off. we took it in again, and found out it was the temp gauge (which we had suspected). the price was reasonable and they turned around the fix within hours. we even took the car to vegas after and it drove smoothly. very happy so far with jason and buddys!"
123,positive,"cliff and craig took very good care of me and my 2008 honda civic and made a long-time customer out of me.

after having my oil changed at a shop down the street that quoted me in excess of $400 for a myriad of recommended repairs, i asked brake masters for a second opinion. 

first and foremost, the customer service was phenomenal. the wait wasn't long to inspect and clean my brakes, flush the transmission fluid, and replace my air filters. the team communicated often concerning their findings and the cost was much less than the first shop. they saved me a brake job, power steering flush, money, and more importantly, time. i felt as though they valued my patronage and sought to provide the best service possible -- an invaluable yield for any service provider."
124,positive,"these guys were honest!  

i had issues with the 2nd gear grinding, so i took it to crawford transmission.  i was expecting a bill of around $2,000.  that seems to be the average for transmission replacement and repair.  they guy from crawford's took it for a test drive, and then showed me a part that had simply come loose.  he re-fastened it for free!

it's hard to find such honest people in the car repair business."
125,positive,"as most vw/audi drivers know, these are awesome cars until a check engine light comes on.  having only driven vw/audi's my whole life i'm used to this and accept it because when they are running great they are fantastic cars to drive.  you also learn very early that it takes a special mechanic with the skills and knowledge to accurately work on these vehicles.  well, look no further because this shop can fix anything.

about a year ago i let a friend who hadn't driven stick in a while drive my car home from the bar and it was a huge mistake.  he somehow managed to stall the car extremely violently, but the car restarted and it wasn't until the next day that i saw the dreaded cel.  i noticed a considerable loss of power and torque and was scared something catastrophic had happened to the engine.  i took it to a shop in cleveland where i had just got transferred to for work and the guy said he loved to work on audi's and that it shouldn't be a problem.  well, almost $2,000 dollars later the car was still not running right.  i was so frustrated that i just dealt with it until i was transferred back to pittsburgh and couldn't take it anymore.

i read the reviews for this shop and decided i'd give it a shot.  immediately after walking in you know this shop specializes in vw/audi, which was a relief for me.  they say if you can fix those cars you can probably fix anything.  i talked to greg when i dropped my car off and felt a lot better about the situation knowing these guys could handle it.  greg was able to diagnose the problem that the other guy couldn't and make a great suggestion to save me more money down the road.  well, i picked my car up last night and couldn't believe my eyes when the check engine light was off and the car drove amazing on the way home, it felt like a brand new car.  i'm so thankful that they finally fixed it and really took the time to explain (greg and rock) and answer any questions even though they are super busy.

as long as i'm in the area they have a customer for life.  hopefully, my car isn't going back anytime soon though."
126,positive,"i had my lexus only 1 week when i was hit in the side by a truck in a parking lot.  needless to say, i was very skeptical as to how it would look after it was repaired, especially matching the paint.  i was reassured by caliber that it would look as good as new.  we were updated by text at every step.  and, when we picked it up, we were pleasantly surprised, because it did look as good as new.  even my husband, who used to paint vehicles, said they did a great job matching the paint.  hopefully, i won't need their services again, but if i ever need a car repaired, i will definitely use caliber collision on wt harris blvd."
127,positive,"amazing customer service in the service department! drove from cali at 4am and check engine light came on at 7am. they took my car in without appt at 9am and got it back the same day. since i'm from out of state and had no appt, i had been denied any service at other chevy dealer in vegas. henderson chevy was nothing but helpful and quick. andy, you are awesome! thank you henderson chevy for making my business to nevada successful and as stress free as possible. :)"
128,positive,"have purchased two vehicles through autonation scion tempe, and have always been treated great by eddie and his great team down there. scheduling appointments is extremely easy, and any issues that have arisen with my vehicle under warranty were always honored. in fact, when the throwout bearing (under powertrain warranty) went out on my car and resulted in significant smoke/burn damage to my clutch (manual transmission), autonation ensured that i would have a new clutch replaced on my vehicle as well. this was a class act on their part, and i respect the service reps at this location along with the management. 

will always use autonation, and i have had no significant issues with any appointments at this dealership. would recommend to a friend, as i believe they are very trustworthy."
129,positive,"had my car towed to bell lexus after the engine caught on fire.

when i took it home, the check engine light came back on.

they gave me a loaner car for $10.00 and discovered the vvt valve was bad not related to the fire.

replace the oil control valve and sent me on my way.

would never go anywhere else for service on my lex, these guys rock!"
130,positive,"my dreaded check engine light was on and i was told at auto zone that it could be a number of issues. i was referred by a friend to check out mello motives, tim and his crew were able to get my vehicle in assess the problem. they could have really taken me to the cleaner but i was in and out with a new temperature check gauge and my car is running beautifully again! to say that i'm highly satisfied is an understatement, don't hesitate to trust this team for your next car needs."
131,positive,just want to say a big thank you to everybody at ultimate collision.. dennis was amazing and helped me tremendously the work was flawless and i could not be more happy with my car! and the work that they did made it look just like the day i bought it which is only two months ago! they take pride in their customer service and their work if you're going to go get your car repaired anywhere please go here and contact dennis! five stars from me and i will refer everybody to this establishment!
132,positive,"i decided to go here bc of the great yelp reviews. found out for myself they are excellent. very nice and professional. they replaced my needed part and my check engine light came on again right after (frustrating, but it happens), so i was able to bring it right back and they replaced a couple hoses to that part and it took care of the problem. it is working great now. highly recommend."
133,positive,"these guys were fast, friendly, and efficient. brandon topped off the washer fluid, balanced the tire pressure, and checked the transmission fluid, coolant, and battery, all before the oil change was complete. as i was being rung up, i got an apology for them being ""backed up"". i waited maybe 15 minutes, and the oil change only took 15 minutes! not only is this team faster than terrible herbst, they're less expensive, much friendlier, and work with a sense of urgency. i got there around 8:30 am, so my assumption is, the earlier you get there the better, because by the time i left they had 2 lines each 3 cars deep. again, big thanks to this team on restoring my faith; i've had nothing but bad experiences w/service stations and dealerships, but these guys were great."
134,positive,"i have been taking all of my vehicles to desert car care for a couple of years now and have always been pleased with the results.  they have performed fluid changes, brakes, transmission services, and other repairs.  they are prompt and i have never had any charges that were not reasonable.  i recommend them to anyone that needs auto repair and maintenance."
135,positive,"the staff there are friendly. the damage was minor but it took two weeks to get the car repaired because every time we were told it was ""ready"" it wasn't.  we had color matching issues. our claims rep, erin, was great though!"
136,positive,"rolf and chris of framers workshop provide a transcendental service:   they
transform and elevate art into finished and focused pieces to be treasured as a legacy.   the
technique, expertise, and discernment exhibited by their matting and framework
never ceases to astonish the eye.   i just
had a complex pastel on paper framed
with extraordinary results.   rolf even
framed a painted car muffler for me on
oak plinth with plexiglass a few years ago.   if you would like to experience
the pinnacle of the art of framing, come
to framer's workshop!"
137,positive,"i took my son there to have a performance muffler to put on his car. jonny and scott were the 2 guys that helped us out and they were really knowledgeable about what they do and very informative. 

they offered some suggestions as to which muffler is the best fit for what my son wants for look and sound.

they wasted no time ordering the muffler and within 2 hours my son had exactly what he wanted on his car. i highly recommend this place and either of these guys to do the work.

its kind of funny because jonny sounds exactly like the character seth from the movie superbad! just a little side note but back on track i go...check them out if you need a muffler, they will do a great job!"
138,positive,"in reading the previous reviews, people either seem to love this place or hate it -- put me in the first group. my car  -- suddenly and without notice -- started sounding like a 1970's hooptie datsun with a bad muffler. i took it in, they put it off on the lift, and showed me how the pipe holding the muffler to the catalytic converter was corroded and probably just jarred loose while going over a bump. they dropped me off at chinook center to kill time (only about an hour and a half) and boom -- it was done, and for about $300 (which is exactly what i expected.) no up-selling, no replacing anything which didn't need replacing. straight-up guys; respectful, and great at what they do."
139,positive,"i was very impressed by the professionalism and expertise of the whole team at aamco transmissions.  not only they treat their customers very well but they are highly skilled.

i went to see aamco transmissions after visiting three other car mechanics about one problem with my car; a loud vibrating noise starting at speeds above 50mph.  the results from the visits at other automotive shops ranged from offering to charge me for standard safety checks that may or may not be related to the actual problem, to actually proceeding to unnecessary part replacement, to complete misdiagnosis of the problem at the transmission level.  in sharp contrast, aamco offered to diagnose the car for free, including the transmission, found the actual problem - a part under the hood was slightly loose and would start flapping when too much air would get under - and fixed it for free.  when this was done, one of the franchise owners - brian - drove the car with me to make sure the problem was solved.

in addition to fixing your problems, these guys are also very friendly and professional.  i only wish all car mechanics would have this type of work ethics."
140,positive,"this is the best mechanic experience i have had in years. tim is honest, knowledgable and plesant to work with. i had dialed mr. mechanic thinking i was calling another muffler shop. awesome mistake! i drove 23 miles at the last minute for him to put on a catalytic converter and  a thermostat. 2 hours later it was done and the price was 50% lower than a quote i had. i was ready to donate my vehicle until then.  i will be going back for him to fix my cvs axle and boot. i would give this mechanic 10 stars."
141,positive,"my husband,and i helped a little bit, used the self service at u fix it. i can say that we are extremly happy with how it turned out. shop was clean, organized and customercare was outstanding.
i know we saved about 300$ by bleeding the breakes and changing the transmission fluid ourself.instead of 80-120$ an hour we payed 20$ for the lift and 10$ for specialty tools...this includes good adwise from realy good tecs.
so if you know what you do and dont have a problem to get dirty yourself this is the place to be."
142,positive,"highly recommend. i have taken my jeep in for: oil changes, spark plug replacement, coolant and transmission flushes/exchanges. john jay has been straightforward, honest, and prices his services very reasonably. john jay has earned the right to be my new mechanic and i trust anyone who takes their vehicle to his shop will be equally satisfied."
143,positive,"i just took my z4 to these guys after getting ripped off at the dealer over and over.  i can't believe how much cheaper the prices were than my previous repairs were from the bmw dealer.  bryan was the mechanic and he fixed my check engine light.  as a woman you have to be very careful when going to some random mechanic.  suzette was amazing, she explained to me the whole process and the prices were very fair.  i would recommend this shop to anyone who has a bmw or mini!!!"
144,positive,"my 2003 f150 could not have gotten better care! i took my truck to rebel automotive on the recommendation of a friend. another shop had diagnosed my truck as in need of ball joints but balked when i gave them my extended warrantee information so i decided to get another opinion. lee at rebel took my short list of complaints , some noise and vibration issues, and went with me for a test drive asking me to indicate the sounds and vibrations as i noticed them. not some around the block test drive , we drove about 10 miles before lee was fully satisfied. i left lee my warrantee information and my truck. four hours later lee called me to let me know that he had rotated my tires and rebalanced one of the rears and the vibration was gone. he went on to tell me that i needed to replace my transmission mount ( one of my complaints ) and both engine mounts were badly rotted. lee had already called and gotten approval for the repairs and we set up a time for me to return for the repairs. incidentally, lee assured me that there was nothing wrong with my ball joints. 

after setting up a tentative date to perform the repairs, lee and i discussed an air conditioning problem i was having. lee promised to check that for me when next my truck was in. 

when the chassis issues were rectified, ( in a very prompt ) fashion, lee called me with a time estimate for the a/c repairs, he also told me that he had received authorization from my warrantee to proceed with that repair as well. i was thrilled and authorized the repairs. 

i left rebel automotive a very happy customer having had all my issues resolved, a fraudulent claim avoided and only having to make two trips and pay two $50 deductibles and a very reasonable fee for the tire work and an oil change. i figure if this keeps up i'll keep my truck another 10 years with lee and rebel automotive's help. five stars!"
145,positive,"these guys were extremely accommodating. we were towing through town when we started having some problems with our truck. mike answered my call and made my vehicle his priority. unfortunately the problem wasn't an easy fix and i ultimately needed a new transmission. within an hour of leaving sun, i was having my truck towed to the dealership. this was hard to stomach after spending over $700 at sun auto.  when i asked at the dealership, the employees there stated that sun auto is extremely reputable. based on their customer service i would return."
146,positive,"5 stars plus!!! munich motors is a top level, masterful mechanic shop. they have just completed an automatic to manual transmission swap on my e36 m3. if you don't already know, this is a major project to take on. this is not the kind of thing that  just any shop will, or can do. the finished project is flawless, not to say that there wasn't any hiccups during the process but,  the extremely diligent manner in which they handled the issues was just more reassurance of how capable and honest they are. the whole project took a little more than 4 weeks, it was drivable after 3 weeks, there  was just a few small ""buttoning up"" type of return trips to munich motors. to be clear that was part of the plan from the beginning so there were almost no suprises. grant kept in touch with me regularly because he knew that this project was a big deal to me , so he gave me updates several times a week or whenever a major part of the project was completed then informed me as to what was next. i greatly appreciated that courtesy especially because they are a busy garage yet still gave me a lot of personal attention, taking the time to explain all the technical processes in a way that a non-mechanic could understand. although this was an expensive undertaking it wasn't because  of munich motors . 
the boss, grant,  actually made  sure that he and his master tech, graham, did everything they could to keep costs down. mostly by being extremely generous with the man hours. the cost for parts was also low. on a lot of the parts they made no profit and i simply paid what it cost them. they also did a lug stud conversion, spacers, and got me new tires for less then i would have paid anywhere else.  bottom line, they took excellent care of me and my car. grant even gifted me an $80 shift knob, which i would have bought anyway but that's how much they value their customers.  mechanics of this caliber are rare. i will literally never take my m3 anywhere else. don't hesitate to take your bmw or mercedes benz to munich motors they will do the best job possible. other shops may be able to do what munich motors does but i wouldn't even consider it personally. if you want your  german car taken care of properly just go to munich motors. you will not be disappointed."
147,positive,"don't let the fact that it is a part of a 'chain' put you off. they are as close to a neighbor business as it gets. the manager todd, seemed to know (many by name) more than half the customers that came in while i was waiting, and you could tell they were happy customers, coming back for regular service.

i have been here in the past for an alignment and was pleased and went back for a few  30,000 mile service items that i do not do myself (i am old school and still do my own oil/rotate tires/wipers, etc). they were among the cheapest of the non dealers i called after you check for coupons on the web. and, they ended up being slightly less than they quoted me on the phone as the trans flush required slightly less fluid than standard. 

service was even done slightly ahead of schedule! (ps - several eating establishments in the same parking lot if you decide to wait)"
148,positive,"i recently had a tensioner replaced on my audi a5, the car was in and out within an hour and the parts and labor were reasonably priced. this is the second service i had on this car, my previous service was a transmission flush and ss brake line install each time the service has been timely and of high quality. 

in addition to the service they performed, they have also loaded an apr stage 2+ file on the a5. unless there is a absolute need to take my car to an audi dealership, az euros will be my first stop to service the three audi's in my stable."
149,positive,"i called a lot of different places cause my transmission needed some maintenance! all quoted me $2,500 to $3,500! i called this place they did less then $2,000. plus fix my oil leak! and was still less then $2,000. very helpful friendly and won't rip u off! recommend this place to any one!"
150,positive,geico referred me to caliber as a preferred repair shop. the attention to detail and consistent communication keeping me posted about repair status was exemplary. brought car home and noted the auto lock on drivers door with fob in my pocket no longer worked. called and spoke with the manager and we arranged to have it looked at this morning. less than 30 minutes later the door works fine and they even installed a new headlamp housing i had purchased on my own. bottom line is that the customer service and expert technical service have been wonderful through the stressful process of having my car repaired back to the rythym of my life. thanks you guys.
151,positive,amazing service!! the flange from my exhaust was missing and nissan wanted to charge me $280 plus labor for a replacement muffler! the team here took me in quickly and fixed my car within 30 mins for a fraction of what i might've paid. my brother is in the automotive industry and he and a few of my friends recommended jpg exhaust- so happy i came here!
152,positive,"i am so thrilled with my new exhaust setup installed this afternoon.  joe really knows his stuff and they are an extremely busy muffler shop.  clean, honest and dependable mechanics very capable of doing custom muffler work to your everyday solutions to pass smog.

i originally came to see them because i used them about 10 years ago when i had another modified vehicle that i did custom work on.  they were professional then and i knew in the back of my mind i was going to see if they were still in business.  luckily they were and joe suggested i buy the pre packaged bassani x pipe online and they would install it for only $140!  extremely reasonable, especially for the simple fact i don't have a lift in my garage.  i dropped it off at 8am this morning and it was done just after 1pm.  when i came to pick up my stang i knew immediately they got the right look i was looking for.  he also hooked me up with two chrome tips for only $100!

extremely reasonable shop and nice employees.  they're very busy, so be patient if you're looking for quality work.  would use again."
153,positive,"we originally took our 1998 jeep cherokee to a transmission shop close to our home. i had warned my husband about how some shops will try to tell you right off the bat that you need a rebuild done (have experienced this many times in the past). the first shop gave us some crazy number of $1500 plus and that may not even solve the problem. so we decided to take it to aamco for a second opinion. ricardo called and told us that they would require a few hours of labor to dive into the transmission and try to solve the problem for us. no matter how long it took, he would only charge us for two hours. that was cool with us. we heard from him the next day and he informed us that they couldn't diagnose the issue and most likely it had to do with the electronic control module and that we should take it to a place that could look further into that. he also decided to not charge us anything for the time spent looking for the transmission issues. we ended up fixing the issue ourselves by cleaning the plugs on the ecm. if it weren't for ricardo's honesty and idea to check the ecm, we would have most likely spent a fortune on fixing an issue that didn't exist- like what the first transmission shop wanted to charge for. in a world of repair shops that insist on raking people over the coals, it's nice to have a place like this aamco and someone like ricardo who tells the truth and gives you great advice on top of it. thank  you ricardo!"
154,positive,"i have an 8 year old mercedes c280 with 90,000 miles on it and the transmission started giving problems. i wouldn't consider taking it to a dealer and instead took it to one place that was highly recommended - and got an estimate for $2,200. but i didn't feel confident in them. so i brought it to m.b. motors and was immediately impressed with their knowledge and professionalism. they pinpointed the problem very quickly and repaired it within a couple of days. the final bill was $1,500 and they did a super job. from now on i'll use them exclusively for all my servicing needs."
155,positive,"i have been taking my car here for a few months now for oil changes and other services. i am really happy with their efficiency, customer service and honesty. as a woman, i know i have been lied to in the past when having my car worked on. fortunately, i know a fair amount about cars as my dad taught me, and am able to tell when mechanics are trying to make a sale for the most part. i have never had that experience here. they have earned my business for more that just tires and oil changes- i recently had my brakes and rotors replaced and will have my transmission fluid changed very soon. their prices are fair- i am sure on some services you could find slightly cheaper prices ($5-20 maybe), but overall i think they are competitively priced, and you're paying for quality work."
156,positive,"sun auto service is a life saver! my fiancé and i were traveling from southern california to utah when we had unexpected car problems. i called and spoke to jimmy on the phone and he told me to head in and he would immediately diagnose the issue and get everything fixed. we arrived at 4pm and jimmy was able to diagnose the issue, get in contact with my warranty company, get the repairs approved and order the parts before 6pm. turns out i needed to have my water pump and alternator replaced.

they were friendly, informative and well equipped to help. they had our car repaired by 10am the next morning and we were back on the road with no further issues. i highly recommend any of the sun auto locations in the las vegas area, they will go the extra mile to help you. all things considered they helped turn what could have been a horrible road trip experience into a pleasant and speedy bump in the 'road'. the guys here couldn't have been nicer."
157,positive,awesome place.  we went to see if we needed a new muffler.  most business would have said yes and charged accordingly.  he took a look and said a seal was blown.  promply replaced it while we were out shopping and now our son's truck sounds quiet as a mouse.  highly recommend this place.  :)
158,positive,"i have been to this shop several times having my car repaired over the last couple of years, and have never had a problem with any of the work performed.  every single time that i have been in, they have diagnosed, ordered parts for, and repaired my car in a timely manner.  prices are very reasonable in comparison to other shops around town.  this is a ""mom and pop"" shop with a staff that is very knowledgeable in the repair field.  i wouldn't take my car anywhere else to be repaired.  the owner, john, is super friendly, listens to what your problem is and makes sure that everything is repaired the first time through.  i have had such services as a/c compressor replacement, emissions system work, water pump replacement as well as general maintenance.  don't trust your car to just anyone, make the drive to glendale repairs and you won't be disappointed."
159,positive,"i first had my transmission rebuilt by cottman's in february. through a series of unfortunate events, i ended having to go back to them several times over the next few months. i have to say that initially i was skeptical that they would be able to resolve my issues to my satisfaction, but the gm, bard, made sure i was satisfied, even extending my warranty because of the delay. although things did not go perfectly, bard and his staff were committed to making sure i was happy. that means a lot in today's environment of indifferent customer service. i have returned twice since for minor problems unrelated to the original repairs, and was extremely pleased with the service. i would absolutely recommend this company based on my personal experience."
160,positive,"great service - great prices!

the people who work here know what they're talking about and won't fix something that isn't broken. in fact, if you're doing something wrong, they'll show you how to do it right.

while i was waiting for my oil change; i wandered around the show room and spotted some really cool new syles available from really good taiwanese brands. if you want something that's not on the floor they'll order it for you, same day.

[if you don't know, chinese brands are terrible and super cheap; but taiwanese brands are great -all the best manufacturing in the world occurs in taiwan and japan; semi-conductors/computer chips/engines/scooters -fyi]

when i got my scooter back, it ran better than ever! 
-it cost $30 for an engine oil change, transmission oil change and break check.

....now i want the laid-back cali. touring scooter for cruising tempe this summer (brand new it's under $2k for a 125cc!!!!!wow!!!)"
161,positive,check engine light came back on. stopped in immediately....will update review when i get my car back. don't want to give lower stars to mess up their rating if handled properly. keep ya posted
162,positive,"these guys (along with my brother's extensive tool collection) have kept my 1995 e320 wagon going for over 211,000 miles. they are amazing. great prices and free shipping on orders over $50. i ordered two flex disks and a transmission mount yesterday late morning and they were just delivered today at 9:30 am.  can't beat that."
163,positive,"before finding the guys at huntersville auto tech i'd never been to the same shop twice to have my car repaired.  since i found them, i haven't been to anyone else.  

you'll be treated fairly, if your car doesn't need to be fixed, they'll tell you.  if your car does need to be fixed, you'll get the most fair price you've ever gotten, and the work will be done right.  they also don't take a week to do a one or two day job.  if they had 6 stars they would get it."
164,positive,"i took my old 2002 rav 4 to firestone for an oil
change and i was told it needed 2 rear shocks, 2 front bushings, 2 arms, a transmission mount, and all 4 tires. imagine my horror when they told me how much it would cost. i thought about getting rid of the car for good, despite its 3-yo transmission, because everytime i go to firestone, they seem to find something that's wrong with it, costing me a lot of money. i mean it's an old car but i maintained it. i'm so glad i used yelp and found h tech auto. i called them up and took the car there. bernard was very helpful. norman did the diagnostics, and he showed and explained to me what needed to be done. i was shocked that it only needed 2 rear shocks and a transmission mount as opposed to everything  firestone wanted to do to that would've costed me a lot, just for the labor alone. norman also found that firestone over tightened the cap when they did my oil change, causing the washer to crack and the oil to leak out. they quoted me with a significantly lower price (parts and labor), only for the necessary things to be done and nothing more. i was very happy! bernard even offered to take me to and pick me up from work when i drop off my car, since they had to order the parts. i dropped off my car 2 days later and they finished the job before the day was over. i met pete, who did the job himself. he was super nice and very reassuring. i trust his expertise. alex was also very helpful and accommodating. the whole team deserves more than 5 stars, in my opinion. they have great customer service, honest-to-goodness dealings, lower pricing, and they're trustworthy. i recommend this place to everyone who needs their car serviced or repaired. i'll never go back to firestone."
165,positive,"after getting a brake job this afternoon (thanks, rusty!), i was reminded that i have been getting great service from bob and his gang for over 17 years. this is a great shop for getting oil changes, tire rotations, mufflers, brakes, and numerous other basic services. the prices have always been fair, the information great, and the services excellent. i always recommend this meineke as a place you can trust."
166,positive,"on a trip from so. cal. to vegas my car overheated.  aaa towed the car to tonys.
the service was excellent- had an estimate to us within 2 hours and car repaired within then next 4 hours!.  i needed a new radiator, hoses, fan and thermostat-- first thing to ever be repaired on my 2005 aviator -  the cost was surprisingly reasonable!  it would have easily been 60% higher in california for the same repairs.  
i would highly recommend."
167,positive,"i had originally installed a bolt on cat back system on my truck and was pretty happy with the results. i later decided i wanted to go more aggressive (louder) and picked up a new muffler and y pipe. the y pipe i had purchased wasn't quite the right size so they swapped it with one they had no problem. in and out with the new muffler and y pipe in less than an hour. service was top notch and i am extremely happy with my new setup. price was outstanding to boot, i will definitely return with any further exhaust work. highly recommend!"
168,positive,"i brought my 1987 corvette into this shop after it had spent a few years in a body shop for a full restoration. i had diagnostic issues with a check engine light and ken the mechanic confirmed the codes i found and fixed my car right the first time. i asked him to do a rear differential service on my car since it had been sitting for years at the previous shop and when i returned to pick up my car he said, ""someone at the bodyshop must have already done this service as the fluids are clean and look new"". he could have easily have just done the service and i would have never known, now that's an honest mechanic. i have met the owner sung and i must say both ken and sung are very knowledgeable. i will be back to this shop. they will be working on my 1966 cadillac this weekend as they work on both modern and classic cars. i have added this shop to my conacts list!"
169,positive,when i brought my car in to get my flat tire repaired in my oil change they found an oil leak that was that happened when my car was built they fixed it but then when i drove it away the check engine light came on and they said it was either when i took it back to him the next day they said it was either the oxygen sensor or the catalytic converter so they ordered the oxygen sensor they put it in today the check engine light went away but my car is still making a noise so i'm going to take it back to him tomorrow but they were very nice to me today they brought me home and when my car was ready they called me and i just want to say that there was a problem with my car they they came in they pick me up to bring me back to my car so i do want to thank them for that and i will i know they will take good care of me and fix this problem i'm having with my car much thanks to nationwide buick gmc and denise
170,positive,"i've lived in las vegas for 2 years now and the first time i got my oil changed here i went to jiffy lube. i thought it was all good but as soon as i left, my car started smoking and my check engine light came on. i went back to them and they wiped it off so it stopped smoking however my light never went off and my car started running weird. i was looking for a reliable place that actually cares about their customers but is also affordable. i found this place and it was great. the staff, especially joe, was welcoming and friendly. they had a cool waiting room, and when i got my car back it didn't smoke or have a light on. (how it should be) definitely going back to them for any work i need done in the future."
171,positive,"incredibly happy i found this place.   although getting your car repaired is never fun or convenient, tracy definitely makes the process painless and worry-free.

i am always impressed with the quality of their work, their customer service, and their honest, reasonable pricing. 

i wouldn't (and don't) go anywhere else for auto body repairs."
172,positive,"i brought my new (to me) '07 toyota 4runner to mike and mark after it started shifting strangely.  mike and mark assuaged my fears of a completely blown transmission.  they also clarified some misunderstandings i had about my vehicle, as well as brought me into the garage to show me my car on the lift.  they showed me the cause of my problems and carefully explained the service that my vehicle did (and did not) need.  

i was given a ride home, and was called in the afternoon (as promised) when my car was ready for pickup.

i am so glad to have found a local, trustworthy mechanic for my car."
173,positive,"we've had so many bad experiences with auto shops, i never thought we'd find someone we could actually trust. the guys at rebel actually changed our minds about this. they are awesome....great at what they do, competitive prices and honest. if you take your vehicle there and ask them for something and you don't need it they'll actually tell you instead of ripping you off. they changed the transmission in our lincoln truck and let us know that it was probably still under warranty, which i didn't even think to check. we ended up getting everything covered by the transmission company since it was a defect and we were so thankful! they've also worked on our other car and they always do the best job. told us our brakes were fine when we came to get them changed (most places would just change them to get the money). i'm so thankful we found them and will recommend them to everyone we know."
174,positive,i got a cat back exhaust system installed from performance muffler about 6 years back using all the parts they had in house. never had any issues since. the did a great job and would recommend them to others
175,positive,this is the best place to get your car repaired in town. i have taken my car elsewhere and spent a lot of money and it was not repaired correctly. these guys are very honest and fair with their prices and they get the job done quickly and correctly. very nice people to do business with. i highly recommend them
176,positive,"they rotate tires for free even if you don't buy your tires there. yeah, that's definitely their sales pitch, but i will definitely go back to a discount tire in the future for my tire needs. 

i was in and out in 20 minutes and didn't pay a dime. so much win."
177,positive,"i recently moved to az from ca.  i noticed some transmission fluid leaking and needed to take my gmc truck to a trustworthy shop to get fixed.  i asked a co-worker of mine if he knew of anyone local and he recommended good works.  so i took my truck in and elsie, the shop lady, was super nice.  they ended up putting my truck on a lift and had me come in to review.  standing underneath my truck glenn and the crew pointed out what was wrong and showed me exactly what was leaking and made suggestions to fix.  i thought that approach was so cool as usually your left in some waiting room taking some guys suggestion for repair without even seeing what the issues are. needless to say they fixed my truck and stood by their work.  i've taken my wife's yukon in for repairs as well.  they are not the cheapest place in town but they do a great job and stand by their work.  without a doubt i have had the best experience for car repairs with good works auto repair!  highly recommended!!"
178,positive,"i can't say enough good things about this shop. first, disclaimer, i was ase certified *many* years ago, before most cars had computer controlled systems. so i like to think i know enough to not be deceived by auto shops.

i have frequented marshall's service center for years, and been perfectly happy with them, except for one small issue. they are 10 miles from my house. so any lengthy service that requires dropping the vehicle off (they don't have shuttle service) can be a pain. so the only reason i tried community was initially because they are close, and because abc 15 news did a ""smart shopper"" segment on them so i thought, ""how bad could they be?""

i started off with a simple oil change, tire rotation, and ""could you please check some kind of fluid leak behind the left rear tire?"" i elected to hang out in the lobby, and within 15 minutes the tech came in and asked me to come look at the vehicle on the rack. he found my left rear shock was ""shot"" and leaking fluid. it was clear to me that was causing the stain on my garage floor, so i went ahead with replacement of that.

i had also mentioned an odd shifting problem with the auto transmission. they found my transmission pan gasket leaking which *might* be causing the transmission to slip due to low fluid levels. i opted to hold off on that for a few weeks and come back for a full transmission system flush and gasket replacement.

as the repair went on, i listened to a conversation with another customer in the lobby with lorenzo, the service manager. the customer had been told by a chevrolet dealership that his pcv valve was bad, which was causing a performance problem with his vehicle but that ""the valve and the valve cover for the head is one piece"" and must be replaced together, all told costing $700. myself, and lorenzo, thought that sounded suspicious so lorenzo (free of charge) made some phone calls for the customer to find that the pcv valve was separate from the valve cover, and cost a mere $5 for the pcv valve. the customer could swap that out themselves rather than paying the tech to do it or let community do it for a small charge.

all that said, it's clear to me that community treats customer's well, and they don't try to pull a fast one and make you spend money you don't need to. further, i've had a nagging ""clanking"" noise in the front end of my vehicle for 2 years that no one has been able to isolate. the tech at community took my vehicle for a test drive after replacing shocks and changing the oil, and relayed that he heard the sound i had complained about. he took another look at the vehicle and said, ""oh, it's your stabilizer, the bushing is worn and every time i drove over a bump in the road, it made that noise."" now that said, the repair is 10+ hours which means about $1000 to fix, but the tech made it clear this isn't a safety issue, just an annoyance. until, of course, it gets really worn and then could be a safety issue but i was just impressed after one drive of the vehicle, he knew what the problem was (and again, he showed me).

i can't say enough about the integrity of this shop. i'll be coming back again with all of my vehicles. not withstanding my love of marshall's service center, these guys are only 5 miles from my house and they're awesome :)"
179,positive,"anything exhaust related on my car, i come here to get it fixed. i been referred here to get my exhaust work done here. i came here a total of 4 times, 2 times to get my muffler fixed, ! time to get my exhaust manifold fixed, and 1 time to get a exhaust leak fixed. every time they called to explain what needed fixed and gave me a price. everything my car was fixed in a timely manner. i usual dealt with mark who was friendly and did profession work. prices do seem kind of high but that's my only complaint. i will continue to come here but hopefully something doesn't go wrong with my car in awhile."
180,positive,"i recently needed some work done on my 2004 passat. i have been to this location a few times before for a assortment of repairs but over the past week they truly helped me. first my battery died and i took it to volkswagen north scottsdale and tom radtke was the service representative that took care of me. i expressed my need to have my car asap and even though they were fully booked for that day tom made sure to squeeze my car in and had it back to me in a matter of hours. later that week my check engine light or mil light came on, i made an appointment monday morning to see tom again for the new issue. he was extremely helpful and made sure to get back to me as soon as possible to keep me informed about what needed to be done on my car. i have received extremely consistent customer service at this location in the service department. i truly appreciated the high level of service i received from tom, and while i hopefully won't be back too soon for more repairs i now have a trusted person and location i can go to! thank you tom radtke!"
181,positive,"bruce is amazing! he helped my mom get her car repaired after a collision and we couldn't be happier with the results. it's like she has a new car! it handles better than it did before the accident and looks amazing. even the interior was detailed! the insurance was going to total the car and that would have been a problem for my mom. bruce stepped in. i don't know what he did if anything, but the insurance company decided it was worth fixing and now she has a ""like new"" car again. it was pretty fast turnaround too. i would give bruce 10 stars if yelp would let me! thanks, bruce, for taking such great care of my mom and her car."
182,positive,"i took in my toyota tundra pickup because of a check engine light. there were two bad sensors causing issues. avi the owner/mechanic took good care of my truck. he showed me both the old parts and the diagnostic reports which means a lot. i do my own routine maintenance and have done larger repairs in the past, so i know my way around an engine. i didn't feel ripped off once everything was done and i know my truck will be on the road for years to come. i would recommend courtesy auto repair."
183,positive,"after my car being at chevy dealer an entire day and they never even looked at it, i called here and then drove right over after talking to liz. in 5 minutes they told me i did not have a transmission problem, unlike the dealer. it turned out i needed new spark plugs. i had brakes replaced and they found a few other minor things that needed fixing and got it all done in a few hours and at a reasonable price. liz even got me a rental car for the day so i didn't have to miss anymore time from work.  i can't say enough good thing about this place!! i will be getting all my service and repairs done here from now on."
184,positive,had a couple mufflers replace at performance muffler on my 1962 chevy ll. russ the owner is a knowledgeable and very good at what he does. the quality of the work is excellent i highly recommend using performance muffler. thanks russ keep up the hard work.
185,positive,"honest employees did a great job.i was weary of going to an aamco. i have been to other aamcos and have had unbelievably bad experiences. yet, this aamco had a coupon on their website for a transmission fluid flush for $60 bucks, nearly half off! the staff was very courteous and prompt. i called in the evening and they got me an appointment the next morning on a sat! they were respectful, quick, and didn't feed me any bull about something wrong with my vehicle like every other shady mechanic in az. they did exactly what i paid aamco to do and they did it well. after the flush my transmission is running brand new and was an amazing deal to help further the lifetime of my transmission. these guys are honest and will make me a repeat customer for my future transmission needs! thanks guys!"
186,positive,"i had originally gotten an oil chain at one of their competitors when i found out that my transmission was leaking, but the original place i got my oil change did not fix  transmission leaks. i have only lived in the area a couple years and didn't know where to go but was told to go to good works. they offered to look at my transmission free of charge. they took me back and showed me what was wrong and explained it in terms i understood since i don't know that much about vehicles. they told me it wasn't an issue now but will be in the future they said to come back every few months or so and will check it out. i plan to get all of my car needs repaired by good works from now on!"
187,positive,"while visiting family in aj for thanksgiving, i needed to find a shop to do an oil change on my 35-foot class a motor-home.  i called to see if they could accommodate an rv of this size and if they could do the work that day, without an appointment.  they told me it would be no problem and quoted me right around $55.00.  i was in and out in right around an hour.  they did the routine inspection, lubed the chassis and added a quart of transmission fluid.  i had them use synthetic oil (about 4x the cost @ $5.00-6.00/qt)  my total bill was right around $80.00 +tax.  i can't complain!"
188,positive,had to go here 3x to get what i wanted and they always worked out on the time i wanted. i was gonna go to the muffler shop near me and got quoted $139 on the same thing they did to me for 40$. so the 15 min drive is worth the low price they quote you and the quality of work they put into. definitely the way to go in terms of muffler/exhaust problem/customization.
189,positive,"this was by far the best experience i have ever had with an auto shop. 

my girlfriend and i were traveling across the country from boston to san francisco, and vegas was one of our stops on the trip. everyone's biggest nightmare when driving cross country is having mechanical problems, and breaking down. we started to have acceleration problems and the check engine light was on, so we decided to get it looked at in vegas.

i called early in the morning, when the shop opened, in order to make an appointment and make sure that i had enough time for the car to be fixed. when i called i was told that no appointment was needed and that i could just bring the car in... needless to say i was stunned and amazed.

when i brought it in hamid took my keys, informed me that they had a great selection of coffee, sodas, and cookies that i could enjoy while i waited - i was pretty happy at this point. after a short time, my car was brought into the garaged and diagnosed. not only did hamid give me a diagnosis for what could potentially be wrong with my car, he also gave me a diagnosis of everything else that was wrong with my car, with great descriptions and prices!!!

i ended up getting a couple of things fixed, one the could have been related to my problem, and the other that was completed unrelated, a cracked coolant reservoir,  which hamid suggested i should absolutely get fixed due to the fact that we were driving across the country and going through some hot areas. the entire experience was amazing!

i don't know how other auto shops are around vegas, but there is no need to go anywhere else, hamid and his mechanics are amazing and very friendly."
190,positive,"i first read through all tony's yelp reviews. had to laugh at the couple 1 stars reviews.  sounded like more a language barrier between the front desk and client. oh well we can't make everyone happy all the time.

here's my review in a nut shell.  my mercedes check engine light came on and the engine stalled out on are way into vegas.  we were lucky enough to be within 30 miles of town when it happen. the aaa tow company came out and referred us to tony's.    after arriving tony warned us that he was busy but would fit us in asap. he called the next day and explained we  needed a fuel pump. gave us a verbal estimate which we authorized.  the car was fixed that same day with what i considered a very reasonable price.  the car runs great and i'm very happy with the results of his repairs. 

i'm very thankful for the referral the tow truck campany gave me to tony's. i'm also in the auto repair business and have to admit that it was very hard for me to trust another shop to work on my benz. but tony and his crew did a great job. 

 so i write this review with great confidence that he treats all his old and new clients with the same respect and also prices his repair job correctly. 

great job tony

thanks again

191,positive,"i just had my transmission rebuilt here. jack is polite, has great follow-up, and went above and beyond for me.  i highly recommend this location and especially jack."
192,positive,"my wife and i were visiting our son in henderson and it was time for an oil change. called rebel and joe worked me in. infact, i think he did the service himself. joe & lee have also serviced our son's car transmission & brakes. top shelf kind of guys. i feel they're shop can be trusted with any service needed."
193,positive,"i was shopping around for a muffler and not really sure of what i was looking for but russ helped me out! this company is knowledgeable, gave me a quote over the phone and that's exactly what i paid.  i even left my truck over night because of my schedule and when i picked it up there were no issues and the work and parts they installed are working great! my truck sounds awesome.  thx!"
194,positive,"great place for general car repairs, tires, etc. we have gotten excellent service through the years. we first started going to the west side car-x because my cousin works there but we have generally been impressed with everyone, the quality and speed of the work, etc. our experience in other states (e.g. ny) has not been good with muffler shops, but we very much recommend this place."
195,positive,"i got check engine light on and had some rattling noise from the left exhaust. i found this shop online and decided to give it a try. i was somewhat suspicious about all the five-star reviews before i went there but guess what, they definitely deserve more than that! i explained to bud, the owner, what happened to my car and the things i did. i can tell that he is a great listener and honest man. he said:"" i will tell you if i don't know but i will find it out."" i very much admire his honesty. in addition, he explained very thing to me in great detail and he shared his knowledge with me generously. personally, i am a diyer and have done several projects on my cars. i asked him about a few difficulties i have encountered, and he shared with me what he would do and what tools i will need. bud is such a great mechanic! this is the shop i will bring my car in for as long as i own a mb."
196,positive,"this is my favorite place to get an oil change. always fast, great prices with the groupon deal, really not a better place in town for full synthetic oil changes. this time i had my transmission serviced and power steering fluid changed. only added about 30 mins to my trip."
197,positive,have car repaired here two times without any problem. i feel they are trustworthy honest reliable and friendly.
198,positive,"not only have i purchased my toyota from erin park, but i've had it serviced here for 9 of the 12years that i've owned my toyota.  i'll try and focus on my recent trips for the sake of this review

pros
- my sales rep remembers me by name, and i haven't bought a car from her in 12 years
- they go above and beyond for their customers -- when a check engine light came on, they were able to see me the next day, and were clear upfront that they may not be able to get to it. (meadowvale toyota wanted me to come back a week later)
- most of the service advisors are very pro-active providing me with updates 

cons
- service can be slow, if you're waiting or on a time crunch you need to communicate that to them when you book your appointment and when you bring in your car"
199,positive,"well... there goes my christmas money. i took my car in because of a oil leak today. i walked in at 12pm left at 1:50pm. fair time. i was expecting it to be a lot longer, but they had at least 5 auto technicians on the job and had at least 4 more cars before mine. i was surprised, well not really, that the customer service personnel at the counter were so nice on the phone and in person. the young man that helped me out today was very patient and nice. i was not helped by the woman, wish i got both of their names, was real cool too. anyway it took that time and i was told that i was going to need to take off the oil pan to get to the leak and i also asked for an overall maintenance check out. had that done.

  i was pissed tho. i was pissed at the work my previous auto shops sloppy job that did my transmission on my car and how it was coming back to haunt me with this oil leak problem. i had my transmission rebuild by someone else and when they had that done they sealed off my oil pan so hard that it had three layers of a gasket on it. i am guessing so in the future it wont ever drip. but it was sealed poorly and i am guessing that the liquid nails, not what is supposed to be sealed with, was not allowed to cool off in time to have it permanently sealed so it was still leaking. 

  long story short i had to pay for another new one because this one was so tite the tech had to use a prie bar to take it off. now that i am thinking about it... that way of taking it off could have damaged something else, but thats the risk i took and it came out fine. anyway i did an oil change with a new filter, fixed an issue i did not know with my e break that was not looking all that properly, and that oil issue. oh, also adjust and clean my breaks, air filter, remove & replace windshield washer fluid reservoir. it all came out to $696.20.

  i think the lesson i took away is to not look to cut corners on major repairs. biggest payments were the maintenance on the oil pan gasket and the windshield washer reservoir. it was all done at 5:30ish. man i am still blown away by this mistake of taking it to these other guys... thank goodness i found this place so close to my house. i will be coming here again later this year for more the final things to be done. oh one more thing i had no idea i needed to do my smog check by next week!!! i didn't receive anything in the mail. although i should keep track of it but still... (car that was worked on was a 2001 nissan sentra gxe)"
200,positive,"i have to say, the general manager, jody has taken control of my problems. they had a new builder re-build my transmission completely. they took the time to communicate and assisted me with understanding every step. i am very happy with the outcome and my car is finally driving as it should! 
thank you for taking the customer concern serious and doing the right thing!"
201,positive,stopped by for a quick check engine light diagnosis. quick and efficient. customer service was great and stepped out with satisfaction. that's all i would care for.
202,positive,"so we rolled into vegas at about 3pm on thursday afternoon and my check engine light had been on since half way through the ride from san diego.  we had to stop at the gas station down the street on flamingo rd. to wash up and change in a very gypsy like fashion.

trying to keep it cool and on the safe side(and mainly on a budget) i decided it was best to have my suv diagnosed, did a google search and i came across r&r auto on ogden st.
when we rolled up i was amazed to see that these guys had a huge shop with over six ports and all of them were full, which lead me to believe they have their shit together....sure nuff, in no time i told the lady at the counter what the problem was and i hadn't waited more than 5 minutes when one of the tech's came out with a high-end scanner that was able to tell me exactly why my check engine light was on.

in the meanwhile my wife and 4 yo daugter were able to cool off inside of the office with soda and water while they watched tv on the couch.

apparently a vacuum plug had fallen off and my manifold needed some cleaning, needless to say these guys took care of it within the hour and also performed a leak test on my vacuum system. their prices are waaaay below dealer cost and i was more than happy to pay for their expedient service, it's like they were conscious that were tourists and didn't want to spend our vacation time in a shop

the day before we left we stopped to get an oil change and they even gave us a lift to the old strip and picked us up so we wouldn't have to wait around while our car was serviced.  keep up the good work guys!!!  highly recommend it.

pros:
clean shop
fast service
honest family owned business.

cons:

203,positive,"i went to get my tire fixed, they got me in & out which was perfect!!  i needed my car looked at because it was bouncing all over the place!  so, i bought my car in they took it for a spin  and said i,  my 2008 blue mustang needed struts & shocks.  so i bought my car in the next day to have my car repaired - after they got through working on  my car, low & behold, my ""pearl blue"" mustang was "" purring"" down the highway once again!!  evidently!  they know what thier doing & know how to work on my particular car and it truly shows.  my mustang shines inside & out!!  you know why,  because the love shows through thier repair work on your car and the customer service is fantastic!!!  thanks dimaggios again!!"
204,positive,"so here i am again.

for the third time too. this time it was just a ""get rid of the credit union"" mission. i financed my 2011 chevrolet malibu through america first credit union based in utah. so everything was fine until they started sending me requests for proof of insurance on my 2011 chevrolet malibu ltz that i had purchased from autonation buick gmc west sahara. as soon as i got the windows tinted on my malibu, i picked it up and drove it home and called my insurance agent with state farm. i sent them the forms that america first credit union had sent me. they wanted to named lien holder of the malibu so if it was wrecked, they got the loan paid off from my insurance company. no problem with that. they also wanted proof of coverage on my malibu from the first day i bought it, which was march 16th, and according to my insurance agent with state farm, i had a 15 day grace period to add the malibu to my policy with my lexus at the time being full coverage. so i did this as soon as i possibly could. i got this same request from america first credit union twice, and twice i sent the forms to my insurance agent through fax. then america first credit union hit me with a $3400 insurance policy against my 2011 malibu, because the information my insurance agent was not to ""their liking"". so now they really upset me, so i decided on either refinancing the malibu or possibly getting another car because i was ""done"" with america first credit union. they also bumped my payments up from $346 a month to $402 a month, but didn't extend my loan term.

so i went to autonation buick gmc west sahara where i bought the malibu in the first place. i asked for my salesman devon harger to be there when i got there at 8am. he's the only person i will do business with besides denzell williams because these two men have earned my trust completely. so i drove two 2015 chevrolet impalas that were fully loaded. one was an ltz, the other was a 2lt, but all in all, nice cars. i was hoping to break even on the trade by putting down a little money, and by cancelling the extended warranties and other add ons i got for the malibu. i wasn't expecting to have to go through another car purchase to dump america first credit union. so after doing a ""trade appraisal"" i knew i had negative equity and i realized that doing a refinance on my 2011 chevrolet malibu wasn't feasible. banks won't finance a car for more than what it's worth when attempting to do a refinance. so this led me to the last two options: i could keep my malibu which i loved and still love, or i could look at other vehicles that were 20% off including buick regal, and gmc acadia. i chose to drive a 2016 buick regal, and decided to run the numbers on this particular car to see where i would be at payment wise. i was now already paying $402 a month for my malibu thanks to america first credit union, and the payments on a 2016 regal were just $54 more a month. why so high? we were able to wipe out all of the negative equity by cancelling everything we could with the 2011 malibu, we used the 20% off on the buick regal to take care of the rest of it along with 1k from me, which under the circumstances was not too much to ask. i'm even getting a free window tint on this regal. 

features that i will miss from my malibu:
bose audio system, dark red paint job, bigger than the regal, and the v6 3.6 engine (very sporty performance for a mid size sedan). 
how ever, i got a few bonus's from buying the regal:
v4 turbo charged engine which acts like a v6 but won't eat much gas, a modern built in navigation system with pandora and apple car play built in, cream colored white paint job, and a nice buick interior. both vehicles had remote start, ambient lighting, window tints, dual exhaust, and nice 18 alloy wheels. 

so i thought to myself, it's a trade off on a few things, and a gain on a few things. what's more important to me right now? doing business in my vehicles for real estate, and banking with a trusted credit union out here in nevada, keeping the money local to our economy. and, the buick regal's engine and transmission are built here in the united states of america. its final point of assembly is in canada though, but considering that canada is a huge trading partner of the united states, i can live with it. the vital componants of the car are made here at least. so overall, i am happy with the car, and i'm sure in time i will come to love it, but again, i'm happy with the performance of devon harger, doug (the finance guy in the office) who didn't pressure me into anything,  and steve (finance guy behind the computer screen) because i was given a much fairer deal here on my trade and on the purchase of the 2016 regal than i would have been given at fairway chevrolet on the purchase on a 2016 chevrolet impala ltz or 2lt (which they didn't have any 2lts). to top it off, again thanks to everyone at autonation buick gmc west sahara! i won't go anywhere else to buy a car!"
205,positive,"i've rented a bay there whenever one of my cars needed work. prior to my first rental, i had to watch a video and sign a release. they drove my car in and put it up on the lift. understand, this establishment only rents you a lift and tools. it's not meant to be an ordinary mechanic's  garage.

as the owner of a couple of foreign cars, including a diesel mercedes, it's hard to find places that won't take you for an arm-and-a-leg just to change the oil. i bring my own oil, filters and tools. i'm usually in-and-out in an hour. 

there are entire tool chests for rent (with air tools) for an additional $10/hr. they can order whatever parts you need, from oil and filters all the way to crate motors/transmissions. there is access to online mitchell manuals if you need a reference materials. i just wish they had a parts cleaner. 

if you get in over your head (i have), ask for rick. he will help you or take over the job for a reasonable price. i've seen him working on ferraris, porsches and mercedes. 

there has been some confusion. i've seen other ""professional"" mechanics in there. remember, they rent a bay just like you. i've seen some pretty cheesy activity by some of these guys (hello, don). if rick works on your car (at your request) you will get a u-fix-it receipt. he stands behind his work. he did on one of my cars."
206,positive,"these guys are great. i was having some problems with my audi a4 (oil pressure, and check engine light on) and they took a look at my car right away. eventually they had determined that i needed a new oil pump and called me with an estimate. when i told them i was going to check with the audi dealership to see if my car was still under warranty to take care of the repairs (which it was), they gave me no trouble at all and accommodated my needs by allowing me to pick up my vehicle after hours to drive it to the dealership. by the time they had found out what was wrong, they had spent two hours on it for which i was charged roughly $160 ($79/hour for labor).
not only that, rock went out of his way to unlock my girlfriend's running car when she accidentally locked herself out right outside their shop. cannot give these guys enough credit! very reliable, understanding, and friendly service. 
will be back without a doubt!"
207,positive,"i started having trouble with my pontiac grand prix about fifty miles south of flagstaff, and when i finally got it down to tempe we took it right over to good works. deeanna recalled off the top of her head how much a check engine light inspection would be and made me feel very welcome. as it was late in the day, i received my inspection link early the next morning and realized there was a lot wrong with my high mileage baby. the breakdown of the bill was so helpful and helped us pinpoint how much it was going to cost to get it back home to farmington, new mexico to get to our family mechanic. they covered the minor repair to clear the limp mode on the car in the inspection charge. brian was wonderful over the phone and super helpful. going to pick up my baby in a couple hours to get her home."
208,positive,"i needed my car repaired quickly and at a fair price. i got exactly that with mike and his guys. good, quick mechanics that won't upsell you or try to do unnecessary repairs. mike explained to me exactly what the issue was and even showed me the old part after it was replaced. you get honest, reliable service at car guyz. i will be bringing my car back whenever i need service!"
209,positive,"need a good auto repair place, this is it. 

i have been using terry's for over 8 years. i was introduced to terry's auto by a friend.  since that time, i have used this place exclusively for my cars. 

it is very tough to find an auto mechanic that you can trust.  with terry's, i drop my car off, tell them what i need and walk out. i come back, usually by the end of the day, and he is done.  fair price without a worry. 

have been taking my wifes 1997 chrysler there for years. have had new transmission, new sets of tires, and multiple other basic maintenance.  a vehicle that probably would not have lasted more than 100k miles is still running well at 150k plus miles. 

terry has even been kind enough to work with me on payments when i had transmission installed. 

can't promise he will do the same with you, but then, i have been going to him for 8 years. 

need a good mechanic, look no further..."
210,positive,"thank you tobias for you recent service on my hhr. within a week you got my transmission replaced!! i am back on the road. big kudos to chuck over at the cave creek location. 

to all of my yelp friends, if you need a referral for a great automotive repair shop and servicing center go to tobias automotive specialists"
211,positive,"was referred to performance muffler by cars complete auto care, performance muffler did a great job for a very reasonable price. instead of ""selling me"" a new muffler, they quickly repaired the one i had. great to find an honest repair shop."
212,positive,"these guys are able to diagnose the check engine lights and give you solutions to the problems your car may have.  they have always had the parts i needed and the staff has been courteous and knowledgeable regarding the issues i have had. 

they offer a lot of free services from battery installations, testing alternators to even windshield wiper installations.

they just helped me fix my dreaded check engine light at a fraction of the costs of other places."
213,positive,"i drove in from california and out of nowhere my car started to act funny and my check engine light came on. i called several places and i just kept getting astronomical quotes or people saying it will take a few days to get it fixed. not only was marco able to see me right away, he was very helpful and made me feel at ease. this hands down was the most pleasant experience i've had at an auto repair shop. thank you so much!"
214,positive,"i've been getting my 'ole changed here for 'bout 14 years now.  yes, i meant to say ""'ole"" and not ""oil"".

it costs about $35 for the 'ole change, but if you're a repeat customer, you will receive a $3.00 coupon, bringing the total, along with the tax that we owe our blessed governor to $33.

it may seem like a pricey 'ole change, but they don't just change your 'ole.  they also check and adjust your tire pressure, vacuum your floorboard, top off your windshield washer fluid, brake fluid and power steering fluid (if applicable), inspect your air filter, and lubricate your axles (if applicable).  i buy my own air filters at wal-mart for like $8.00.  they offer other services like automatic transmission fluid replacement with t-tech.

while you're waiting for you 'ole change, you get to listen to music, breathe some exhaust-filled air, and read popular mechanics.  what fun!  two of the mechanics have been working here for quite some time and they are friendly and excellent at what they do."
215,positive,"hamid the owner really caters to his customers. i first walked in and pleasantly surprised to find that it was comparable to the lexus dealership waiting room, on a smaller scale. the waiting area is comfortable with a variety of beverages and even a small freezer for ice cream that is provided to the customers. the bathrooms and lobby was very clean and comfortable. for service, i only got an oil change but they were fast, very reasonable, and professional. i have gone to 4 other automotive shops for a quote on my transmission and was told that it would cost anywhere from $3400-$4000. hamid gave me a quote of $2800. i will definately come back and recommend that anyone looking  for automotive work, come here!!"
216,positive,"not only is this my go-to place for muffler work, i have also had my brakes done here, as well as a tire rod. i went to the old chevy dealer in n. olmsted and they told me i needed a whole new exhaust ($700), went here and they replaced my muffler for $50. since then i have been a loyal customer, recommending all i can to them to save money.

be there before they open in the am. so your car will be first to get worked on. you should have your car back in a few hours. by far, the most affordable (down right cheap) muffler work in the city. and, no ladies, this place will tell you the truth about what is wrong with your car (if your completely clueless, like me). great job all star!"
217,positive,"i'm not one to do reviews on yelp but i had to for this shop.  wow!! is all i have to say about john jay automotive.  i have a 2000 honda civic si, it had a check engine light on for running rich and a couple other issues that stemmed from that.  i took my vehicle to two different shops that only work on honda and acura vehicles.  they couldn't figure out the issue after having my vehicle for 3-4 days at each shop, i was very lost on what to do, i felt i was in trouble. upon further digging for shops and reading reviews i found john jay automotive.  as soon as i walked into john jay automotive i was greeted by the son of jay.  not only was he professional but jay immediately walked out and started talking to me about my vehicle.  not only did i feel at ease but i was talked to like a human and not just a dollar sign.  upon leaving my vehicle i was always updated daily regarding repairs and what they found and what the cause was and how they were going to repair it.  john jay automotive is like no other repair shop i've ever been too.  they went above and beyond my expectations and even did little extra things that no other shop would have done.  once my vehicle was finished i was called and given my pricing for repairs completed and i was so surprised and relieved, not only did they make the repairs and find the issues but no more check engine light.  john jay automotive is an honest, reliable, and fairly priced repair shop that i couldn't be more happy with.  they don't try to overcharge you or charge your for things you don't need.  i will from now on take all my vehicles back here and i will be referring as many people as i can here, and i highly recommend them to anyone reading this."
218,positive,"bell union is the most honest mechanical shop i have ever been too. i took my truck to 2 other places, both gave me a different estimate and service recommendation for fixing my transmission. i took it to sung and ken and they walked me through every part, fluid and piece so i could understand it. it turns out that it didn't even need any servicing yet! they saved me from throwing away hundreds of dollars! if you want the truth, go check these guys out!"
219,positive,"amazing service by jimmy and sean g. super friendly and fast service.
the price was so much lower compared to other places and the job was done better than it would have been at a dealership. 
i heavily recommend coming here for any maintenance, service or transmission issues. 
their lounge is also really comfy compared to most places. normally i leave to go to a starbucks but i was given coffee and comfy seat. 
if you go anywhere else, you're missing out."
220,positive,"my check engine light was on so i took my car to them in order to pass smog. they took care of the problem, and helped me pass within a couple days. very knowledgeable,  very informative and helpful. both joe and lee always give me accurate info, price and time estimates. a week later my fuel injection went out so i had it towed to them. luckily nothing else was damaged so i had them do a tune up while it was there. car is running great and i highly recommend them.  i will keep coming back."
221,positive,"i called ww williams, an authorized allison dealer, in phoenix about a delay shift problem on my allison transmission installed in my tiffin phaeton motorhome from pahrump, nv. jim, the service manager, invited me to bring it in for a diagnostic check. upon arrival several days later after completing my stay in pahrump, javier carrara was assigned as my service advisor. a work order was written up for my specific problem. i mentioned to javier that we live in our motorhome full time and i was assured that a service tech would be assigned asap. we left to have lunch somewhere close by. a few hours later, javier contacted me to inform me that a software update was applied to the tcm  (transmission control module) and that the service tech had driven it for about 7 miles and could not duplicate my problem. since it was already in the shop, i requested a fluid and filter change, which was eventually performed. i was contacted by the evening shift service advisor, jason, who indicated that our coach was ready. i requested a test drive with a service tech (josh) to ensure the delay shift problem was resolved. sure enough, shifted like butter now!! all it required was that software update to fix my shifting problem. josh took the time during my test drive to explain the functions of the transmission and the shifting process which was a great help in understanding it from an owner's perspective.

this is a rather lengthy review but, to net it out, ww williams resolved my shifting problem in a day allowing me to take possession of my home and continue my journey without requiring an over night stay in a hotel!! my thanks to all of the staff at ww williams for the care, expertise and professionalism displayed and exhibited during my maintenance and repair procedures.

i would certainly not hesitate to have future work required on my allison performed at ww williams and would highly recommend them to others needing allison transmission repair or maintenance."
222,positive,"i came to findlay's service department after being treated horribly at henderson chevy. my 2010 malibu had been having issues since i bought it september 16, 2014.  this past weekend was horrible and i decided i needed to have another dealership look at her. i took her in on 1/7/2015 wayne was my service adviser. he was amazing!!!!! he listened to me and actually seemed like he cared and really wanted to get my car fixed. i have had an issue with my car running rough that henderson chevy made me feel like i was crazy, but wayne started my car and said ""your car has a rough idle"". all i could think was i knew i wasn't crazy! well a really long story short my transmission needs to be flushed because the fluid in there is overheating and dirty. i'm not thrilled i have to pay for a service henderson chevrolet should of done months ago, but i am happy that my car will be better. i will continue to come to findlay chevy for all my car service needs.  thank you so much!!!!"
223,positive,"yelp did not disappoint. this was 1 of 3 my wife narrowed down for a transmission service & general diagnostics. first stop was really expensive & quoted a 3 hour wait. my wife directed me to hamid & team at busy buggy. not only was the transmission service less expensive than cars on valley view, it was also completed in 1 hour. hamid also made recommendations to repair in the future without pressure & upselling. other mechanics have used fear tactics if the upsell is rejected & remark ""be careful out there,"" with an obviously sarcastic tone. not the experience here. great complementary keurig coffee, ice cream and cookies...as far as auto shops go, who else does that in vegas? thanks busy buggy for your great service when your competitors were only concerned about closing up shop to start their new years eve parties. hat's off to you!"
224,positive,"i have been to this shop multiple times and have always received great service from joe and his team. this shop was highly recommended to me and i would highly recommend this shop to anyone in need of  exhaust work or install. they offer quality work and great pricing. 

my fourth time using the shop i was in a pinch and needed work done to my audi....asap. although they were slammed, joe made me feel like a priority and got the work done on his own time. my mechanic at audi came with me to the shop and was blown away by the quality of work that joe did on my car. 

****regarding the review by ken f, i too am a minority and have never once felt this way about joe or anyone on his team. i am sorry that you felt this way about your experience. i know that this was a misunderstanding and  hope that you will give these guys another shot. i know that your perception is your reality, but in this case your perception of this shop is wrong and they deserve another chance. thanks for listening.**** 

thanks again joe. i will continue to refer people to you and you are the only muffler shop i will use."
225,positive,"great honest work. i had another shop do transmission work, and i had nothing but troubles afterwards. i found el jesse's shop online and brought my jeep in. they repaired it at a good price, and when something else sprang up after the initial repair they fixed it at only the cost of parts. i'll definitely return if i need any more transmission work."
226,positive,"this is my favorite car service shop on the entire planet! every time i've ever brought in a vehicle i feel i've been treated fairly and squarely by first-rate professionals, who bend over backwards to take care of you; giving you the straight scoop on your vehicle; and they don't try to sell you anything that isn't truly ready to be replaced. let's face it, taking a vehicle in for service isn't typically anyone's idea of a barrel of fun.  

and, who hasn't at some point in their lives had a vehicle in for something simple, such as an oil change, only to get handed an estimate of $1,759 (or a lot more) for supposed repairs your vehicle may not truly need? not to mention that if you object to any of the estimate, particularly the most farfetched part of it, you may be told something to the effect that your vehicle ""could blow up,"" or ""the wheels will fall off, "" or ""you could be left stranded on the freeway,"" etc. if you're like me, you've been told this sort of thing many, many times. 

that doesn't ever happen at kelly clark, as they don't suggest replacing something unless you actually need the repair. in my mind, their integrity is as immaculate as the squeaky-clean waiting room. customers just want honesty, and you'll get it at kelly clark. and they also do a better job of explaining exactly what is going on with your car than any place i have ever had a vehicle in for service. 

one if my favorite experiences here was when i brought a car brought a car in here, extemporaneously, that i was thinking of buying and asked them to do a complete inspection of the vehicle (as the owner had no documented maintenance records); and i was a little leery of taking a stranger's word for how well the car had been maintained.  naturally, the owner of the vehicle was not too thrilled we were there (since the car was pristine in his mind), but he agreed to have the inspection as a condition of selling the car.

fortunately, as i anticipated, kelly clark immediately jumped to attention and whipped the car in and out in a very timely fashion, replete with an assessment (either ""pass"" or ""fail"" for everything they checked).  and the final price ($57) was not only extremely reasonable, but it was also below the quote!  

i ended buying the car, with peace of mind, thanks to kelly clark and their excellent service.

update: 18 months - and 29k miles later - this car has not had a single repair, other than regular maintenance which was recommended by kelly clark at the time of the inspection (and corroborated by other facilities that subsequently arrived at the same conclusion): flushing the transmission fluid, brake pads, and flushing the power steering fluid. kelly clark was spot on!

update 2: 26 months - and 48k miles later - this car has only had one repair: a stuck lug nut. meaning, that kelly clark's recommendation to buy the car turned out to be right on the money! thank you, kelly clark, you're the best!"
227,positive,"my husband and i had used another repair facility adjacent to.aaa, for 15 years, for all our car care needs. after increasing labor charges and too many mistakes we decided to try aaa. we have never regretted the switch! we just had major (over $7800) work done on a 2000 vehicle and all-encompassing services were nothing short of stellar! david b. advised us along the way of every issue, kept us up to date on the work, worked within our budget and came in before the promise date. when your car is like your child you need to have total trust and faith in the people taking care of her. we do with this garage. from the service advisors to mechanics to courtesy drivers, this aaa garage exemplifies what any repair shop should be-a place of excellence.  oh, and by the way... i had taken my car to (sounds like spank mo) to check my transmission. they of all people should know this part of the car, right? wrong! they told me i needed a total rebuild to the tune of over $3800. aaa found it was only the speed sensors which was picked up by good old-fashioned computer codes.  $500.00 of the bill above was for this repair. transmission is good as gold.
after the work,  david reviewed all warranties, when to come back for rechecks etc and it was extensively road-tested before it was returned to me. she drives fabulously!
the garage is clean, waiting area spacious, is near starbucks and some local eateries, they have very friendly shuttle service, and there is a discount on labor costs for aaa members. 
thanks to this garage i have my baby back and i have a trusted garage i can rely on without any bs. love you, david!!"
228,positive,"good, reliable, trustworthy, and cheap mechanics are hard to find. heck, finding a mechanic that just fits one of the aforementioned categories is hard to find! 

well, hidden away on scranton road on the western edge of tremont, there's a little shop that fits within all of the categories in spades.

my wife has a 2003 acura. our check engine light went on, so we headed off to autozone to have them scan the codes and see what was up. based on what was written in the owner's manual, we thought it may have been the transmission. i was afraid that the transmission needed to be replaced (ouch!) but since it had just been replaced in 2009, there was no way that was what was wrong. autozone said the spark plugs just needed to be replaced (whew!), and when we asked for a good local mechanic, they recommended tu casa. 

i didn't know what to expect, but when they checked out our car and told us that we could save money if we went and picked up the parts ourselves, i was sold. many places will jack up the prices on parts to make a profit, and for them to suggest that we could save money by buying our own parts was a great sign of honesty in my opinion. a return trip to autozone saved us some cash, and an hour or so later, we had new plugs. they discovered that an ignition coil needed to be replaced too, so we told them we'd be back. when we asked for a labor quote on that, he told us that there'd be no charge since it only takes 5 minutes to replace, and it did.

i'm beyond pleased with our experience here--the labor prices were reasonable, the service was fast, and best of all, i don't feel ripped off. i'm never excited about having to visit a mechanic, but at least i know that the next time i need car repair done, i'll be taking my car to a good place and i won't be getting fleeced."
229,positive,"unbelievably well run shop. they take such great care of their customers. they get me in quickly, and out quickly and always leave me with excellent work and a clean car when i drive out. 

i never stick around while they are servicing my car because i need to get back to work; but they make it hard to leave. there is abundant good food, coffee, beverages, comfortable seating, televisions, an enclosed play area for children with great games and movies.

who wants to waste time getting their car repaired? pretty much no one, but earnhardt takes the sting out of the time investment with the great atmosphere and top notch customer service.
thanks, norm!!! you did it again!"
230,positive,shawn in the service department was extremely helpful! i had a very weird issue with my murano on a recent road trip and found out i need a new transmission :/ ! nissan replaced it and gave me a rental car for a couple days! happy with my experience there!
231,positive,a repair shop to trust and what could be better than that.  i took my car in with a difficult to determine problem.  my dealer told me it was a transmission fix for more than $1900.  buddys was recommended by a friend.  they were honest and fair with a quick computer diagnosis and i was out the door for 100 bucks and extremely relieved that i found a trustworthy repair shop.
232,positive,"i had a check engine light come on, i have to tell you from the time i got someone on the phone i felt a relief each and every employee was just wonderful. i will never visit or recommend any other shop than this one. you guys rock!"
233,positive,my check engine light had come in on my car. firestone said it was going to cost about $300 to do a complete diagnostic on it.  a friend told me about ron's.  got it checked and the problem fixed for less than what the diagnostic would have cost me at firestone.  great service.
234,positive,"great customer service...thought my tailpipe/muffler was bent because it was off the hanger due to backing into a rock. took it in an the manager/worker put it on the lift, put the tailpipe back on the hanger and it wasn't bent as bad as i thought....manager didn't charge me a dime. next time i need work done, that's the place to go. thanks"
235,positive,"fantastic work done on my honda civic. i went in for a transmission fluid change, they took care of me fast and paid a super reasonable price. highly recommended."
236,positive,"i have been there twice. the first time,  i got my car repaired after seating in my garage for almost 5 years. everything was rightly done to my car, and prices were fair and very reasonable -for having original parts being installed to my car. the second time, i went to do minor interior repairs, and again, i found that prices for parts and labor were very reasonable for a volkswagen dealership. i have to note too that i received knowledgeable and professional service from tom radtke, that i found their facilities very comfortable while i waited, and that i received my car in the time promised, and paid very close to the original quote agreed upon. remember, this car was almost abandoned for five years, so, few things came up on the road to have it back to drivable conditions once again."
237,positive,"often, it's as though most service relationships are adversarial...you vs them, as though there must be a winner and a loser.  it's uncommon to come across a business that treats you fairly and genuinely cares about your experience throughout the business interaction.  what is even more exceptional is finding a business that is able to leave an impression on you not just once, but one that consistently exceeds your expectations.  we discovered stamps when my wife's car was in need of tires.  our first experience brought us back, and every experience since has reaffirmed my opinion that tim and his team are truly a rare find in the service industry.  
    most recently, i brought my f250 in for servicing.  of course, it was a weekday morning, trying to get kids to school before heading to work, and the truck won't start.  based on the input of a roadside assistance team, i was expecting to walk out with two new batteries and at least one, if not two alternators (dual alternator vehicle), and a hefty unexpected bill.  once the roadside assistance team got me running, i immediately called tim and explained the situation.  tim, understanding my need to find a solution before it was time to pick up kids, worked with his schedule and told me that if i came right in, he'd have me ready by that afternoon.  when i dropped off the truck, tim had me in and out, he even drove me back to the house so that i could make arrangements to get to work as quickly as possible.  around lunch tim called me to let me know that he had checked the entire system (batteries, alternators, starter, wiring, etc) and the good news was that everything checked out except the batteries.  regarding the batteries, i asked his opinion on several brands i'd researched, including some of the top-tier batteries on the market.  tim had every opportunity to up-sell me but that's not how stamps does business.  instead, he considered my typical vehicle use, and recommended a set of batteries that should last me much longer without breaking the bank.  when i picked up the truck that afternoon, tim was again there to meet me.  he explained exactly how they tested the system, what they found, and asked if i had questions....what you typically expect from a good service provider.  tim then told me to check-in with him and let him know if i saw anything out of the ordinary.  he specifically told me what conditions to be aware of that might be indicative of another issue and reiterated to call him if there were any other difficulties.  this is what, in my opinion, makes stamps a great service provider.  
   as i was getting ready to leave, tim understood that this was an unanticipated expense and let me know that he was going to help me out on the final invoice.  he applied a generous discount and wished me a happy thanksgiving.  i walked out feeling as though i had someone looking out for my interests and i hope the stamps team takes pride in knowing that they have absolutely earned my loyalty...a win-win situation, which should be the goal of any service provider."
238,positive,"i called dan with a question concerning my 1970 c6 transmission. he took the time to research online and gave me my answer, knowing that my project is in idaho."
239,positive,"i reached out to joe a month before i wanted my exhaust put on. he was helpful, made some suggestions, then made the appointment. when the day came to get the work done, it was done prompt and the quality was great. joe made sure that i was happy with everything prior to my leaving town. 

i will go to the shop should i need anything with my muffler in the future."
240,positive,"this review is for the service department. i brought my car here yesterday to have some warranty work done on my transmission. i called ahead for an appointment and dave burkhardt was able to set me up for that afternoon to assess the work that needed to be done. dave explained that the actual repairs could take a few days, which i was prepared for. 

when i arrived for my appointment, dave greeted me and checked me in quickly. i only had to wait 30 minutes for them to assess the issue and give me an update which i thought was fantastic! parts had to be ordered. dave explained it could take a week to arrive due to demand. i asked if it was ok to drive and dave set my mind at ease and explained that i couldn't hurt it by driving which was a relief. 

overall i had a very pleasant experience."
241,positive,"when i first moved to az from mn i had a check engine light on my vw jetta.  finding out i would fail my emissions test with that might on i took it to tech 1 auto.  in mn, i had taken it to two different car repair shops as well as 2 vw dealerships--no one could figure it out!  tech 1 auto fixed it! great customer service! 

had a bad battery recently, so i took it back to tech 1 auto.  another very good experience.  fred is a great guy, always feel i can trust this place!"
242,positive,these guys know exhausts. i needed to get my car modified with straight pipes and get the resonators cut. performance muffler did it no problem. it was quick. in and out in like 20 mins. i actually called around to get some price quotes and this shop has the cheapest one. first time to get my car serviced here and they left a good impression no doubt. highly recommended.
243,positive,"let me start by saying that i grew up with a father who was a mechanic, and now that he is retired i have had to find other mechanics for my car needs.  i was getting an oil change and the young man asked me if i knew why my engine light was on, and i said that it was my transmission and i was scheduled to take her in to aamco the following day.....he said nooooooo, don't take your car there unless you want to pay an arm & leg!  he referred me to all-pro transmission where he had his transmission worked recently and loved the work he had done and the customer service.  i called all-pro and this very friendly man named jim answered....i let him know my situation and he put me at ease by telling me that he wouldn't charge me a penny to look into the issue and i was surprised since aamco was gong to charge me over $400 just to look into the transmission.  i got a rebuilt transmission within 4 days and i can't express the communication from jim the owner was the best i've ever had from any company.  he called me every day to let me know how things were going and i didn't even have to call them once!  i truly believe that this company is like a hidden treasure.....some of the best places are hard to find, but when you find them...you want to share the news with everyone!"
244,positive,"earns five stars because, 1) speed: they rebuilt my dead transmission in less than 24 hours, 2) honesty: saved me $900 by checking the tcm (transmission control module) and noticing it was still in good condition before replacing it and 3) reliability; giving their work a two year, 24,000 mile warranty and 4) more honesty: letting me know up front what their estimate included.  the work is done in-house by a tight knit crew of experts.  go here!"
245,positive,i called shane whitted and told him i had a potential seal leak in either transmission or axle.  he said bring it in to check and they found it was an axle seal leak that shane said was covered under warranty. we found a time i could come back for service and he arranged a loaner car while my car was fixed.  great service and having the loaner car was key to great satisfaction while my car was repaired. thanks shane and the findlay team.
246,positive,"my car broke done at state line and i had to have it towed to tony's. i couldn't have asked for a better place to have my car repaired. tony and his staff, especially jennifer, were courteous, efficient and quickly repaired my car. their customer service was excellent, they called me to tell me what was wrong and 3 hours later the car was ready. the cost for repair was very reasonable.my car drives better than ever. i would highly recommend tony's to anyone in need of repairs. thank you tony and staff, chris"
247,positive,just had some work done for my transmission which went defective after so many complaints to the dealer about it. the car was slamming a lot and turned out the transmission was bad. worked with brian and trinity from phoenix bimmer and was able to get a new one on my extended warranty. i gotta say i love these ppl they are very professional and communicated with me every step of the way. brian did a great job and my car feels like new again. no more slamming. forget the dealership i'm glad i found these guys.
248,positive,came in to do a simple muffler delete on my mercedes. quality welding and they price reasonably for the job. highly recommend them!
249,positive,"i had a phenomenal experience with e & n auto and accessories! i took my van to nathan, told him the symptoms, and he started right away with determining the problem and viable solutions. i felt valued as a customer knowing that my input was considered in determining the problem. additionally, i appreciated being informed of every step in the process in a timely manner. i had my vehicle towed in on thursday, and the work was completed by friday. not only was the work and customer service high-quality, nathan exceeded my expectations by vacuuming my van and addressing an issue with my check engine light. if you want reasonable labor and parts with a company you can trust, put your faith-and vehicle-in the hands of e & n. they will not steer you wrong."
250,positive,"recently had my older vehicle into the wilson-niblett repair centre for an oil change and diagnosis of some transmission noise. i was able to drop in with no appointment and they found a space for me right away. debbie oliver greeted me promptly and listened to my concerns and gave me a solid timeline. the oil change was done on schedule and she ensured very discount available was applied. when the diagnosis became more complicated, she insured i had a loaner car so i could continue with my day. due poor weather conditions the technicians could not properly diagnose the problem as a test drive was needed and the slippery conditions would hide possible problems. rather than proceed with unnecessary repairs and saving me money, the technician and debbie recommended a return on another day to ensure a proper diagnosis was completed.
i returned a week later and debbie was ready for me with a loaner car waiting. i left my vehicle overnight and once again the repair schedule that debbie promised was adhered to with every discount available applied. though debbie was not working on the day i picked up my vehicle, she still ensured that i was taken care of. todd delmore was there bright and early at 7:30am on a saturday with all my paperwork ready and the car prepared to drive away. 
overall, the service i received from all the staff including todd, the technician, but especially debbie oliver, was outstanding. i was never left uninformed, all schedules were strictly adhered to, and i was provided with alternate transportation both times insuring as little inconvenience as possible. while i may have saved a dollar or two by shopping around, i highly doubt i would ever have received anything close to the level of service that debbie and the rest of the staff provided. well done debbie and wilson-niblett."
251,positive,my family and i were on our way to vegas when our engine mounts broke. mark at major auto service helped right away to get the car repaired quickly and at a great price. he got us back on the road and in great shape! a great repair shop in vegas at great prices!!
252,positive,"i went here to get my serpentine belt replaced and a transmission flushed and these guys were friendly and efficient.  they took the time to explain things to me and i felt comfortable that they were making the appropriate recommendations without trying to charge me for things i didn't need.  it was ready in just a few hours as promised so i was able to pick it up same day.  only complaint is that they left my transmission fluid dipstick out of place under the hood so it was just laying on top, but fortunately it didn't fall down and screw up anything since it was laying flat on the top, but if it had that could've been a more serious problem.  so i subtracted a star for that since it seemed a bit careless."
253,positive,"went in to get a oil change and transmission i had coupons and saved a couple hundred i'm sure. the assistant manager tim i think was thorough and helpful when some places want to get you in and out i've never had someone lift my car and show me with my own eyes the issues i had going on i'm not trusting of allot of these places, but that showed me my issues were real and honest. definitely recommend."
254,positive,"i was driving a used car (new to me) from palm springs to denver. the check engine light came on before vegas. i thought ""oh s@$&"". brought it into tony's and immediately i knew i was at the right place. they gave me an honest assessment of the diagnostic report, and though there was potential for a bigger problem they were able to assure me that i'd be fine all the way through the mountains. saved me from all that stress that i was so worked up about. i felt like family at this place and i'm sure you will too!"
255,positive,"update :  jeremy the manager called and offered to do the remaining repairs for free. i appreciate their effort to correct this. thanks sun devil.

*while i appreciate the quick and friendly service i always get from sun devil, my last experience was not so good. i brought my car in because i had a check engine light going on and off and the car was running rough. i was told new spark plugs and a fuel system treatment would fix it. i paid the $650 for the repair and went on my way. the next day my engine light came on and the same problem persisted. i brought it back in and they explained that now i needed oxygen sensors and that it would be another $700. i do not know if my car needed the prior repairs but something is wrong and maybe they didn't diagnose it correctly."
256,positive,"this review is long overdue. i had worked many years for a competitor. however, i left i wanted to purchase a fun and dependable car so i purchased a new 2009 scion xb from earnhardt with assistance from accessories subject matter expert with gary childress. my plan was to gift my son slightly used xb when he received his dl within two years. much to my dismay my son although very athletic and master dance moves crank dat lion king/superman etc., however could not master manual transmission (new clutch installed during lessons). 

my (lol) xb now has over 189k miles with numerous trips to tucson (work 5 days a week for 8 months), disneyland, san diego and my hometown of seattle it has never failed due to vanessa villalobos the best service advisor in the world. whenever i've had an issue she has solution with the usual great price and service. i will continue going to earnhardt until the death of my xb. 

and they offer free shuttle service in addition to free coffee, water, popcorn, and donuts while you wait. can't beat that with a baseball bat,"
257,positive,"i own two 2012 sorentos and recently had the transmission fluid replaced on both. i waited on-site for the work to be completed while enjoying fresh coffee (at 2:30pm, very nice). jose, my service advisor, was professional and did not push additional parts or services. very nice. 

i used discount coupons to offset the bs 10% ""shop supplies"" charges most shops like to tack on to the bill these days to mask the real cost of the service you authorize. get on their mail/email list to receive coupons. if it wasn't for the shop supplies charge, i would have awarded 5 stars."
258,positive,"this was my first time using 5 star auto and they now have a new customer.  not only did they treat me right, they took care of my truck which i had to bring back a few times for a mischievous vacuum leak.  they charged me for the 1st fix and then after having another check engine light come on, they diagnosed and fixed without adding to my charges.   they got the tenacious issue fixed even though due to my schedule- months later, they still honored the fix and made sure they got it right!  

some things are not so cut and dry and instead of going all in and charging a huge repair..they started with the little things that could have been causing the issue, or were in fact causing a portion of the issue.  along the way, another issue came about and they repaired that as well and not once did i feel nervous about having my truck there or how i would be taken care of.

bobby was great and is very knowledgeable about what he does and his staff is as well.  mike at the front was on point and i always felt that no matter what, the issue would be fixed.  

this was my first time at 5 star which came highly recommended by friends on facebook and i felt like a long time customer and part of the family so to speak.  

they know what they're doing their, they think outside the box and with respect to my old truck (98 ford expedition), they fixed the issue but never pressured me for a major fix that would out cost the value of the truck.  they do smart and good business there and they now have a new customer.

i live in henderson, not close to them at all but because they do good biz, i'll be returning for my future repair needs.

thanks bobby and mikey!  5 star auto is deserving of 5 stars!"
259,positive,"great service!!!
we took our '94 cadillac here on the recommendation of a friend.  we had tried to get our car repaired at ted wiens firestone on rainbow twice without success and at the cost of over $500.  when we took it into 5 star auto repair,  bobby diagnosed the problem within 2 minutes.  he had to have a hose assembly made special to replace the old one that had a huge tear in it (they must have blind mechanics at ted wiens).  we took it back in when the part came in and bobby had it fixed in no time at a reasonable price and we were treated with respect.  wish we had known about 5 star auto repair earlier.  we are thankful to have finally found a business we can feel safe taking our cars to for repair.  thanks bobby!"
260,positive,"i purchased new tires and brakes from this location 17 years ago, and now that i'm living in the area again, they were my first go to.
i called and spoke with james on the phone. he was very kind and personable and took the time to look up my vehicle's requirements and provided me quotes and all of the information necessary regarding the warranties. often when i call auto shops the individuals on the phone are not personable and act like i'm bothering them. this is not what i got from james.
when i arrived gina helped me out. she was very fun and polite and we had some good conversations. she really took the time to talk with me and made me feel like i could really trust big o. 
i ended up getting new tires, a warranty, alignment plan, and they flushed the brakes and transmission. the vehicle is 6 years old, so it wasn't shocking that this needed to be done. she kept me up to date on the status of my car and called me when it was ready.
i felt the pricing was fair. i can't say anything bad about the experience."
261,positive,"i needed an oil change and general safety inspection, but i was having trouble finding a place with decent reviews that took appointments and had weekend hours. i called this aamco and the guy said that they usually only do transmission work on the weekend, so their mechanics/general tech guys aren't in. however, he offered to schedule me for a saturday morning appointment as he was going to be in that weekend anyway. i was happy to accept his offer and the actual appointment went very well. the man i spoke with and who worked on my car is very personable and accommodating, and the maintenance he performed on my car was done well and priced fairly. i don't know if they will always be able to accommodate my schedule, but my experience thus far is that they are at least willing to try."
262,positive,"just left with a 6.2l yukon sounding like a v8 is supposed to. did a highway run at 75mph.  the magnaflow they recommended put the perfect amount of growl into wide open throttle with little to no noticeable drone at low rpm in 4 or 8 cylinder mode. this is the 4th or 7th time in 20 years these guys listened to what i asked for and nailed it on the first go. 

need muffler/exhaust work?  go here everytime."
263,positive,"found about all-tranz by word of mouth, i have been in the automotive business a long time and they have done multiple transmission's for me in a timely manner at a fair price!  sully and joe do a nice job."
264,positive,"twice these guys have helped us with great customer service. we blew our transmission and while they couldn't rebuild a transmission on a suzuki, they knew who could and got us in right away. fixed at a fair price. the second time we had a muffler issue. we dropped in, they took it into the shop and had it fixed in 45 minutes at an extremely fair price. we will always use them from now on.  great service and very knowledgeable."
265,positive,"i was very pleased with my service this time. this particular wilhelm garage has a new manager (as far as i can tell). chris has moved to corporate, and while i liked him and thought he was a good guy, there's no doubt that we had a few issues with wilhelm's service when he was there, and after the last debacle with our overheating issue, we considered not returning. however, since that time i have taken this particular vehicle back a few times, and each experience has been positive. we had wilhelm take the wheel locks off the car, and while doing so, they broke the cap on the rim. they could have easily failed to inform us, but they took responsibility and ordered a new cap. chris was also very helpful in referring us to someone who could do transmission work that they couldn't do at the shop. our last visit was just as positive. we had a leak in the transmission, and it was a seal that wilhelms could fix. i was very grateful for the quick service and reasonable price--two luxuries not often experienced while servicing a car in general. most important, however, is that while i was waiting for the car, some apparent ""big whigs"" in the company visited the store and were talking to the new manager (can't recall his name). i overheard him say that he isn't in business to gouge his customers...that he is just trying to make a living and provide his customers with the best service possible at the best price. i have to say, i didn't think anyone in the auto repair industry possessed that degree of integrity. my experience has always been being gouged and taken advantage of. that comment from him alone will ensure that i continue taking my vehicle to wilhelms for the foreseeable future."
266,positive,"i have a 25 year old car i love.  in fact, prior to writing this review i was filling out the forms to get my classic plates!

after a bad experience with what used to be a good mechanic i took my car in for chris to check out.  it was refreshing to have someone immediately know what i was talking about not just blow smoke up my skirt. 

one of the repairs was major and since i have owned this vehicle for a couple of decades, i knew what was wrong with rear suspension and how much it would cost. the other issue really just proved how bad the last mechanics were because what should have been done in a major tune up hadn't been done.

to cut to the chase i dropped bank but i'm ok with that.  it was still a lot less than what the dealer would have charged me and i got a couple things fixed that the dealer wouldn't do anyway... including a paint to match passenger side mirror where i broke off the outer portion of it years ago and replacing the automatic lock on the passenger side. 

i still have the issue with the brakes being grabby but forgot to ask chris to look at them.  (fyi: i went to palladin because i dropped bank for new tires and brakes at another place and the car went in working fine and came out with alleged transmission problems.  old brakes, find.  new brakes super grabby and the place blamed it on the transmission.  funny how i didn't have an alleged transmission problem when i brought the car in.  that's almost as funny as the dealer telling me i needed a new ""u-joint"" when i actually had a bubble in a front tire that was causing the car to wobble!)"
267,positive,"while in vegas i contacted tony's and went there to have my check engine light diagnosed. fast, no bs, straight talk, took a look, concluded i was good to go, and didn't charge me when they could have...guess who is in my cellphone now when i or a friend needs a mechanic in vegas?"
268,positive,"frick park automotive has some mixed reviews floating around. but because they're conveniently located for me (and because some of their negative reviews had nothing to do with their service), i decided to give them a shot.  i've taken my car there three times now, all for routine service.

first, i simply needed to have a flat fixed in january. they turned it around quickly. when i went to pick it up, the owner simply handed me the keys and said ""have a nice day."" ""what do i owe you?"" ""don't worry about it."" true, for these folks fixing a flat is a simple task, but i expected to pay a few bucks, as is common. 

purely based on that gesture and my interactions with the owner (and knowing how much i hate taking the car to the dealership), i went to fpa for my inspection and oil change. there was no hassle, no hidden fees, no pressure to purchase unnecessary parts or services. solid.

shortly after my inspection, my windshield cracked nearly the whole way across thanks to a rock being kicked up on the highway. after having it replaced elsewhere, i had to go back to fpa to get the stickers replaced. again, simple, friendly, no hassle.

the folks at fpa quickly earned my trust. not only are they more convenient and less of a hassle than the dealership, their prices are reasonable, and i'd much rather support a local business than a corporate one. so far, i've nothing but good experiences with frick park automotive."
269,positive,"best service knowledge ever. would recommend this above all auto shops. just walked in waited under an hour to fix check engine light, they ordered the parts and had them there within 24 hours fixed and gone no issues customer service at top quality. this place goes the extra mile to help find what is the problem with the car , without a sales pitch. by far the best recommend to all anthem and 7 hills residents. go mike you rock."
270,positive,"masterworks is awesome! extremely honest, boruch and the guys do great work and are trustworthy. ive had work done at masterworks in the past. i recently had to take my car to their shop for a check engine light. they took a look at it, spent considerable time coming up with a plan that made sense for me. they didn't charge me a diagnostic fee, even when i ultimately did not get the work done due to personal reasons. my go-to mechanic in cleveland!"
271,positive,"on july 7th of 2016, i had just moved to las vegas and was in the search of a better life for my 3 children, 10, 9 and 7, and i. we were living in montana without a lot of opportunity to have a better life. i was in search of a home, and my children were staying with my mother in montana until i had everything figured out. i was driving a 2003 mitsubishi eclipse and decided that it wasn't the best vehicle for 3 kids, especially with the crazy drivers in las vegas, so i went to drivetime. i knew i didn't have the best credit due to the situation with their father 5 years prior and i was working 3 jobs so i didn't have a lot of time to truly shop around. i came across this 2012 hyundai sonata and just fell in love with it. that was the car for me. i talked with detroy love and the paperwork was signed. i got all the coverage they offered thinking that i would be covered if anything should happen, that was the whole reason for getting a new car from a dealership anyway.

within the first 5 days of the sale, i took the car down to one of their approved specialist. a midas company located on maryland blvd. i noticed some hesitation when idling, almost like a faint purr vibration. i talked with the guys at midas and they told me the car was in perfect condition but if anything did happen, in the notes there would be in writing the vibration when idling so they could go back to it if needed. cool i could deal with that, i got the warranty anyway and if there was an issue, at least it was documented.

i found a house and my kids were brought down from montana from the help of my dad on august 4. we finally had the space we needed, and car big enough and my family was back together and we were doing better than ever. i was elated. this was everything i was working so hard for, little that i knew it would be short lived. on august 13th my check engine light came on. i called averex and told them hey, yo, i've had the car for just over a month and the check engine light is on. they told me to take it down to american auto and tire, one of their approved specialist. they ran the diagnosis and came up with an error code p2191. this error code could have been anything from electrical, to fuel to anything. they told me that they needed at least a day to go through the vehicle to diagnosis it specifically.

i didn't have the availability to just leave my car and still be able to get to all my jobs and take care of my kids, so i called averex to see if a rental vehicle could be provided under warranty. they told me i was more than welcome to get a rental vehicle but they would not provide it for me. if it was approved, i would be reimbursed accordingly. well first of all, you can only get a rental car if you have a credit card, and i did not. i've never had a credit card and never even thought of applying for one with my credit being the way it is (the reason i went to drivetime in the first place). second of all, i could not afford to rent a vehicle and have it reimbursed whenever. hey yo guys, single mom, 3 kids, all starting school, new house, new city, and doing it all myself, above anything i had done before, budgeting on the high side to make sure that the kids are in a safe area and in good school district, we're not on state aid in any way and not even child support from the kid's dad who started over, never looked back, and working under the table. i just couldn't take on more than i already was.

well i ended up just hoping nothing would happen, that it could be fixed before the kids and i ended up stranded somewhere. about a week later, i was filling up gas and for some reason when i got in the car the check engine light was off. so i again was hopeful and thought it could have just been the gas cap, knowing they need a check engine light to run the gadget again anyway i just hoped i would be in a better situation when the light came back on.

on october 31st, my little sister came down to vegas to help me. things were hectic and i hadn't found a steady babysitter yet being new to the area and not knowing many people. that friday, november 4th, the car hesitated starting as i was coming home from work. i came straight home and parked it. the next morning as i was getting ready to head to the store, the car wouldn't start at all. i tried to call averex but they only are open monday- friday 8-5pm. i then proceeded to call drivetime and talk to detroy, who sold me the car and told him the situation, and then talked to about 3 different managers that said there was nothing they could do and to call averex first thing monday morning. thankfully i got a hold of one of my co workers who was able to get me to and from work until then.

first thing monday morning i called averex and got the car towed to american auto and tire, and it was ready by wednesday morning, i woke up around 7 and started walking to pick up the car, it took me 2 hours to get there from my house, but being as i am from montana i have never taken a b"
272,positive,nick and the rest of the group are amazing! last time i got my car repaired they came back with a quote 1/3 of anyone else and when i went to pay  it was even cheaper than that.  as a female i usually get screwed with car stuff but not these guys! recommend to everyone!
273,positive,"after being ripped off by a previous person (not from this company) to fix what i was 99.9% sure was wrong...sun devil auto saved my sanity and car! i realize i am a female in a mans world walking into an auto place but i grew up around men who worked on cars. i don't know it all but i sure know enough! my car would loose power and make a rattling noise when i would try to speed up fairly fast or just enough to get up to speed on a highway. my check engine light was on which gave a misfire and catalytic converter code. apparently the other guy said it was my spark plugs. ok, that's fair because i hadn't changed them in 4-5 yrs. same problem happened a day later! go back...mass airflow thing. hmmmm ok. changed that and a day later same issue. so you can imagine my frustration which i tried to contain walking into this company. i'm human though so i'm sure some of it spilled on them when i first arrived. sorry if it did :-/ i was done being told guesses and my money being spent with no results. i was firm when i walked in here and explained why. the front desk guy (can't remember his name sorry but he has brown hair/beard w/glasses) and bob were extremely patient with me and professional. i appreciated them being confident that they could fix the problem with no charges that weren't needed. it was the very thing i was 99.9% sure of. these guys found it and fixed it all in the same day!!! bob also confirmed that if i drove off and had the issue again i could come back for no charge! the car has been running beautifully and i choose to be so happy with this company. i work across the street and bragged about my experience."
274,positive,"they don't just supply tires they handle all auto repairs.  they  repaired my transmission and replaced the air conditioner compressor for me.  they were very fast, fair priced, and very nice.  i like george he's a good guy.
i should have taken my car to him long before now.
you'd like george."
275,positive,"we have been jiffy lube customers for 15 years.  they are quick, convenient and they do a great job.  why mess with a good thing, right?  recently, we had some difficulty with our suburban.  we thought it was just electrical problems relating to our 4x4 switch.  when we took it to our mechanic they said there could be a possibility that our transfer casing was tampered with.  there are only two shops that touch our cars: jiffy lube and gruelichs.  we called jiffy lube and spoke to the manager on duty, gus.  he was very open to listen and actually came over to the mechanics to inspect the vehicle.  gus notified his supervisor and sent us to the jiffy lube customer service representative, as per their policy.  we thought we were going to get the run around.  mind you, it was during 4th of july holiday, so it did take some time.  we eventually were contacted by the rep who was going to send out the district service manager to our mechanic to inspect the problem with us!  they did not try to attempt to deny responsibility.  they, in our eyes, were taking as many steps as they could towards accountability.  just to be sure that there was no bias, gruelichs asked a third party to open the transfer casing and inspect it.  if it was tampered with we would know immediately.  this morning, we all stood around at state to state transmissions as they opened the casing.  what we found was that jiffy lube was not responsible!  it showed normal wear and tear.  as hard as it was for us to swallow that we would have to pay for what is a common repair to older gm 4x4 vehicles, we were glad that the establishment that we had trusted for 15 years with our three vehicles was still reputable in our eyes.  they did everything right.  from the local manager, gus, to judy the customer service rep, to darren the district service manager, they all listened to the customer.  they came to us, even with the possibility they may have to pay the bill.  they were kind and considerate.  i have to say thank you to jiffy lube for not dismissing us.  thank you for years of good service to our vehicles and our family.  thank you for putting the customer first.  good job guys!"
276,positive,"i was a victim of a parking lot hit and run. my ford explorer suffered a large dent on the rear tailgate. dave and his team were great. they gave me the number of a car rental place near his business. once i arrived, he called to get me picked up. i was in and out for the drop off in less than 30 minutes. his team was able to get my car repaired (i needed a new tailgate) in a week. i got my car back and the work was great and the car was nice and clean. i would highly recommend."
277,positive,"if you need a simple exhaust or muffler fix, they got it here for cheap. for the low so to speak. if you need a repair that requires extensive labor requiring the engine to be removed or if the exhaust leak is close to the manifold, they will not be able to do it. you cannot make an appointment and need to wait in the waiting room. it reminds me of the walking dead. pretty weird but life is weird."
278,positive,it might be the last good honest muffler shop in town.   the guys were straight forward and never trys to upsell me on anything.
279,positive,"took my truck to a local chevy dealership for a check engine light their quote for repairs was $8000. 

not wanting to just fork over 8k i wanted a second opinion. 
i brought it to nick at t&m, had them look it over and what a pleasant surprise $200 for repairs not the $8000 chevy recommended . 

i have done business with t&m on numerous occasions they always do stellar work and as a female i have never felt they have ever tried to take advantage of my situation. 
work is always done quickly and at a fair price. 

thanks guys, keep up the great work"
280,positive,"made an appointment.   staff greeted me and was ready to work on my van.  service was speedy.  oil change, filter, engine flush, transmission fluid change, tires rotated, alignment - all finished within 90 minutes.  solon did wonderful and additionally had free popcorn and free drinks.  thanks dan and terrence and the tech too!"
281,positive,"i own an older toyota vehicle and i needed the catalytic converter replaced in order to pass the emissions test, something that due to a new family addition, i discovered only days before my registration expired. 

i called performance and they quoted me a replacement at just under $300 - on toyotas such as mine the cc (as the experts call it*) is bolted on and no welding is required so it is a quick and typical job - i should have had it replaced at 150k mi, but that's the exact type of thing i don't know.

i dropped my car off that afternoon and picked it up the next morning, ready to go, with a few days left to pass the test and re-register the car - nothing special in the appearance of the shop, but these guys prioritize the customer and the work, even for a boring, non-custom, old-toyota cc* replacement, and by the looks of the shop they do plenty of custom muffler work that i don't understand but clearly some people get very excited about. very pleased all-around. 

*i have no idea what experts call it, i just didn't want to type 'catalytic converter' agai-- dang it now i wasted any saved space gained via that abbreviation, plus even more talking about it! so much regret."
282,positive,"justin was so great! supper knowledgeable and does not push /try to tell you your car needs any extra work!

they did free oil chabges for all vets on veterans day:)! 

both me &my bf came in. his check engine light was on &they figured out that it was just because he didn't scew on the gas cap after gassing up hard enough so that was good bewa. 
i got an oil change there for a good price and they changed out my oil plug which was apparently the wrong one put on @a crappier place(i only paid $5for the new one), but its a good thing they did b4 it caused any damage:)

great place, good service,  pleasant experience! :)"
283,positive,"when i was a teenager, our family took our cars to ""nick"" the mechanic. he was in business for decades because he did good work and he was honest. these days, with most of your options being dealerships or corporate chains it seems this is becoming very hard to find. matthews exxon harkens back to the day when people took pride in their work and charged a fair price. let me repeat that: the mechanics at matthews exxon take pride in their work. if you own a car that is out of warranty and you are looking for a mechanic that won't deceive you to steal your hard earned money, this is the place to find honesty. for those interested, here are a few cases:
1. i had a strange braking noise that was only there sometimes. they kept my car and used it until the noise popped up enough times to figure it out. it turned out to be a small part. if i had gone to a dealer, they would have replaced the whole brake system after bringing it in 10 times because they just don't make the effort most of the time to diagnose. they just replace things until they find the part that was bad. that's fine if you are under warranty but if not, its a horribly expensive way to fix cars. the whole thing cost less than two hundred bucks and scott even had my car washed while he had it.
2. my truck had a check engine light come on. scott sent it to another independent shop that had a more expensive computer system to make sure the codes he was pulling were correct. what? a shop that works with other shops to solve a problem? incredible. considering how hard manufacturers are working to make everything proprietary, it is great to see shops working together to make sure they do a good job.
3. i have takata airbags and have gotten cards about the airbag recall. i had a coupon from the stealership for an oil change so i asked my teenage son to bring it there so i could finally get in writing whether or not they had a solution for the airbags (they didn't). they told him (thinking it was his truck) that he needed an oil pan gasket, transmission gasket and rear main seal ""right away before he has serious engine damage"" to the tune of $3,800. i brought it to exxon who usually services it. they said everything was fine. just a drip from the dipstick tube. that was two years ago. nothing has blown up. could he have said ""sure, i'll do it for $2,000""? yeah, but remember that thing i said about being honest? imagine - the dealer would have taken almost four thousand dollars from my kid because they thought they could get away with it!
4. today, i brought my truck over to a national tire chain in matthews with a small nail and slow leak. right from the start, i knew they were going to try to bullsh*t me into a new tire when they made me sign off that i understand the tire might not be fixable. instead, they said i might need four new tires because they said the tire was not fixable and they could not order a matching one! i drove over to matthews exxon mad that i didn't go there in the first place. it took about 6 minutes and cost $16.05 with tax.

there is a reason some small shops are around forever and never need to advertise while many chains and dealers need to churn as many customers as they can because they can't keep repeat business. it's a lesson that corporate gigs in many fields just can't seem (or don't want) to learn. thanks for taking care of my cars for many years. we appreciate you!"
284,positive,"came here the other day for a check engine light and the person at the front desk named mike fixed it for me. 

the place seemed very reliable and professional so i came back today to get a car i just purchased inspected and they explained what was wrong with my car and what my options were to fix it. the whole experience was very easy and made me feel better about driving my used car. i highly recommend going!"
285,positive,"just needed to get my check engine light diagnostic and ryan m. helped me out and helped me understand what needed to be replaced, didn't have the part in store but offered to special order it. excellent customer service even at 1 am!"
286,positive,"i have not been able to find a trustworthy mechanic until i found this place! i usually come here for my oil changes but when my check engine light came on a few weeks before my registration was due and i needed a smog check, i panicked. i took it in and joe took care of it right away. i was worried because i would have to do whatever repairs was necessary in order to pass smog.  a few hours later, they let me know that they found nothing wrong, they reset the pcm, did a drive cycle, and even took it in for a smog for me.  when i picked up my car, i had a passing smog certificate waiting for me. i didn't even ask for that.  they truly go out of their way to make your experience as pleasant as possible. they could have easily told me something was wrong and charged me a ton of money to fix  it and i would never know because my check engine light was on and i needed it fixed.  this place is honest, trustworthy, and reliable. literally the best place ever. i would recommend it to anyone."
287,positive,wow these guys are awesome! i've never had such a good experience at car places. but these guys are different. super friendly and go out of their way to help you. owner got me in the same day and was done the next. they did an awesome job. i will recommend to anyone that needs muffler work. pricing is very affordable. cant say enough good things. thank you!
288,positive,"i am sorry to see some poor reviews at this location.  chris, mike and sandy saved my pocket over $800.00 a few days ago.  i had been using community tire pros on 32nd st. & took it in for diagnostics on check engine light.  community tire told me it would be 1k plus & then no guarantee it would pass emissions (due @ end of this mo).  i told them no & left.  on a whim i stopped at this location of c & r & chris said he would diagnose @ no charge (community chgd me 90.00 less 20.00 cpn).  they found leaky hose & gasket, fixed it all for under 300.00 & better yet told me i would pass emissions which i did today.  they will get my business in the future."
289,positive,"update: i've been here multiple times since and have nothing but great things to say about joe's auto! great customer service and they do a great job explaining exactly what needs to be done and why.

so i had never been to this place but my dealership said i needed all this work done on my car and i was looking at getting it done someplace else that was a little less expensive.  

i called joe's because i got a flier from them in the mail. i asked th e man who answered about pricing for a transmission flush (my dealership said i needed it at 30,000 miles). he put me on hold for a few then came back and asked how many miles my car had and for more info on the car. he looked it up and told me that i actually didn't need this service for a long time, and that the dealership was probably trying to get more $$. he told me to check the manufacturer's book but said according to them i didn't need this service until a lot later. he also gave me some great advice about what i would probably need to get done in the next year so i would be aware.

this man could have told me to come in,  done the service and taken my $, as i didn't ask if i needed it, i just asked for a price. instead he went out of his way to not only make sure i needed it but also was honest with me that i didn't. 

it is rare to find someone in this industry that would give up money in the interest of honesty and they have just gained a loyal customer, when i actually do need service on my car :)"
290,positive,if your looking for a reliable transmission shop forget about all others locations busters transmissions is the only place you should take you vehicle here are some reasons 1 i you love your car and you want someone who gives a damn about your car there the guys 2 they make sure your happy with the work your car needs 3 they don't ever try to up sell you into fixing crap that's not broken 4 their mechanic is top notch he knows what he's doing and my truck for example had a leak in the transfer case in the rear of the transmission at first we thought it was the rear of the transmission it's self they said they're call me and sure enough they cleaned my entire motor and transmission and told me exactly what was wrong and what needed to be done and with no time at all my truck was done and it drove like a dream 5 and of course the most important thing to everyone they do warranty the work they do and you won't believe how fair the prices for the type of work they do and the service they provide i recommend you look no further and take you car straight to them and have them do a wonderful job and have your car or truck driving like a dream again with no worries in the world
291,positive,"after just 2 weeks of being in arizona, i had another incident added to my string of bad luck. i was trying to register my car after having been pulled over and, luckily, let of with a warning, when my transmission lines blew all the way across town. i called my insurance for a tow and then a brand new amazonian friend recommended virginia auto to bring my car to. i could kiss this new friend. pascal answered when i called to let him know i was coming on a tow and he couldn't have been nicer. when i arrived, he got me checked in and offered me options to get home, since they couldn't look at my car until the next day. luckily, though, i had a ride on the way. 

via text the morning, he let me know what the problem was and the cost. once i ok'd , he was on it and i had my car back at 5 pm. not once did these guys try to upsell me on anything i didn't need or ask for. in fact, they washed my car before giving it back to me!! who does that? these guys, apparently. 

i've never had such a good experience with a shop in the years i've owned cars. i will definitely go back to virginia auto if i have further issues with this or any future vehicle."
292,positive,"i'm their customer for almost two years - 3027 st rose pkwy, henderson -(regular oil change & car maintenance service), the staff is always so friendly, & their prices are pretty fair if not cheaper than the market actually (when i first dealt with them i used to shop around for the best price, before i decided to just call them directly if anything came up & set an appointment!) i never had a problem.
but what really made a huge impression, was when one of my friends who live in sf bought a car from here lv, he had an emergency & couldn't come to pickup his car so i offered to drive it to him to sf. the car had a break malfunction light,  some noise, plus for sure i wanted to check if it is ready for a 500 miles trip (oil, transmission oil, tires & its pressure ...etc), i called and set an appointment, and this is what happened:
- they checked all the oils & liquids in the car!
- they checked the tires & tire pressure!
- they checked the break levels!
- they did the diagnostics for the breaks light & he told me it is not an urgent thing it can safely wait till i deliver it to my friend in sf! (i'm their customer they knew it is not my car, i just told them what is going on)
- they checked the source of the noise & told me it is also safe to wait till it got delivered to my friend in sf.
notice that for the last two he could easy tell me it is important to fix those & just charge me whatever he wants, & i would never know! but they are honest!
the surprise was after he finished, & when i gave him my cc to charge me, he told me i'm their customer & he didn't do anything really & he will not charge me anything!!!! (it took them at least 20 min to check my car!!)
i insisted to charge me at least the labor & his time, he insisted no, because i'm their customer & this the least they can do!!! i swear i didn't know what to say!!! (i wish i know his name, despite they all are the same in the way they treat their customers)
when i told my wife back home she didn't believe there is still good people like this anymore, neither did my friend who didn't believe what happened too!
really thank you so much guys for everything, for the warm friendly treatment, great prices, your coffee , and just everything.............."
293,positive,"had to take my truck in for a transmission rebuild. larry, who was the owner was very helpful and down to earth. they did an awesome job on my gmc sierra and i also have a 24,000 mile warranty. will definitely be back future fixes. thank you guys!"
294,positive,"let me start out by saying my review is all on my customer service experience at the time of my first visit. after seeing all the negative reviews, i have to admit i was a bit skeptical coming here. my husband's 2015 370z's check engine light came on so i decided to give them a try. i was disappointed to hear that one of the catalytic converters needs to be replaced and we're just outside the 80k warranty (car is at 84k) so it's going to cost just over $1400, (was sure wishing they had some sort of grace period but guess not).  i did not have time to leave our car, so my follow up appointment is this friday. 
so let me share why i gave them 5 stars - when i called and made the appointment, i let them know i'd be coming there but will be waiting and need a place to be able to set up my laptop and work. upon my arrival, stu (stewart amrhein) greeted me, found a quiet place for me with a table & outlet for me to set up my laptop and plug in. he was very communicative and super considerate when i was on a phone call so as not to interrupt. i can't express enough how wonderful his customer service skills were - actually quite amazing and something very rare these days. i'll be returning this friday, but this time to drop our car off for the service, *fingers crossed* it goes as well as the first customer service went and i don't have any other service surprises like some have posted."
295,positive,one day i intended to get a transmission fluid change. there was some miscommunication with the staff and me and it took longer than it should. a simple 2 hour or less job turned into at 5 hour job. the management listened to me and compensated with a free service. never in my entire life have i seen any bussiness try to please their customers like this. i will definetly be going back.
296,positive,"just left the shop and very satisfied. i was pretty worried about finding a shop that won't try to rip me off being a new resident without my socal connections i once had.  after spending an hour calling around for pricing, i found performance muffler.  i just wanted my direct fit catalytic converters i bought from canada installed.  i was quoted as high as $760 just for the install something that's a direct fit at some other ""reputable"" muffler shops.  i call performance mufflers and not only did he quote me the best price in town and he said i'll try to get you out of here as fast as i can do you spend only the low end quote.  my infiniti was definitely a little more complex because of the tight space allowed for the mechanic to get to.  after what seems like no time compared to the task at hand, i was ready to go.  asked me what price i quoted them and let me go with the lowest quoted price.  amazing! being a guy who is in the auto industry and a car enthusiast, why wouldn't i tell my friends and family to go here? great work and even better customer service.  if you go somewhere else, you're losing out big time!"
297,positive,"brian and crew were polite and went out of their way to make sure my truck got ready for emissions with a new muffler.  second time i've been in, will go back.  quite pleased with my experience."
298,positive,"bbs accredited since 2003! great place with reasonable pricing. the labor they charged me at $80/hr which seemed fair, they explained what was wrong with the van and walked me through the repairs that were needed.  got a transmission rebuilt with an after market transmission cooler added on to help out with my stop and go driving. they also paid for the tow to get it to them which came out to being about $70 savings.

i highly recommend this place. i will return to have a followup check."
299,positive,"the service here was amazing. they were super fast and very friendly. they won't charge for unnecessary work like some other mechanics or dears ships. i had a check engine light on for my airflow sensor and it was checked for free. they even showed me how to change it if i wanted to do it myself and cleaned my filter to see if the check engine light will go off. amazing service, will come back again."
300,positive,"my husband had a minor accident and had to take his xterra in for some tlc.
his family has had a great body shop in the glendale ca area for 50 years and he knows the business and customer service very well.
he was hesitant to get his car repaired anywhere else, but since moving to las vegas he had to seek help locally.
when they repaired the xterra he did not know what to expect but was completely satisfied with abc's repair process.
they completely informed him of what to expect throughout the repair of his car and advises that he highly recommends this group if you should need auto auto body repair.
i am looking at the car myself this morning for the first time and it is pristeen and washed so beautifully!"
301,positive,"gabe came out in the evening to look at our washer. it was making a weird noise. i initially thought it was a belt, but because of the age of the washer, it didn't have a belt. it was the transmission. this man rocks. he's easy to chat with, super nice, and very knowledgeable about appliances. didn't try to take us, gave us a good deal on the repair, fixed it and was on his way...thank you gabe for fixing our problem washer. i absolutely recommend one shot installation for all your needs..give them a call...we will call him again when we have another issue for sure..thank you gabe"
302,positive,"great, honest estimate and repair. $120 while i wait, where speedy wanted $650 to replace entire muffler for a small whole in the pipe before the muffler because the stainless steel muffler was ""probably"" rusting from the inside. when pushed for a repair estimate speedy wanted $400."
303,positive,"update: wilhem did call me today and went out of their way to help me and make this right! their customer service was excellent, and i was very happy with the way things ended. thank you wilhelm for following through!

the car work may actually be good (that remains to be seen), but they are extremely underhanded and dishonest. i just got back from trying unsuccessfully to be reimbursed by chevy since the work wilhelm did on my car was under warranty, and i wasn't informed until after the fact. my check engine light had come on so i googled the nearest repair shop which happened to be wilhelm on indian school/litchfield and was fooled by the reviews. they ran a diagnostic on my car and informed me it was the ""cam shaft and actuators"" and that the bill would be $738. this was the first time i had dealt with a car dealership as a single lady and maybe that played into this i don't know. i clearly  didn't know much about car repair and didn't get a second opinion- my bad!  i went to pick up my car and that is when i found out if i had taken it to the dealer it would have been covered under warranty. i was then told to go ""talk to chevy"" as i had already paid wilhelm. not surprisingly chevy told me they couldn't reimburse me as they didn't do the work, but that it was under warranty, and the shop ""would have definitely realized these were warrantable parts, but they chose to take advantage of me instead"". if you are looking for an honest mechanic this it not the place for you, and i learned a very expensive lesson!"
304,positive,my mother was taking an emergency trip to flagstaff when her check engine light went on just outside of boulder city. she pulled into the big o tire for some help to insure she would make the trip. and the staff went above and beyond to make sure she would be safe. their thoughtfulness and concern for her safety went above and beyond!
305,positive,"five stars and a bravo to wolbert's! i came here for an estimate recommended by insurance and they seemed nice so i decided to have my car repaired here as well. i called and set up an appointment. when i came in to drop off, at 9am thursday, they called the rental car place for me to pick me up. (little story)as we waited for the rental we were surprised and amused by their electric powered train set and pond. my son dropped a couple toy cars in the pond and i went and retrieved them. well upon doing so i brushed up on a turtle! they have 6 turtles i believe! anyway... the next day (friday) at 4pm we got a call that the car was done! well the repair looks flawless and not only that, but they washed my car! and not just the outside, but the inside as well! my back window hasn't looked so clear in a long time! very nice and friendly employees and great auto repair! thank you wolbert's!"
306,positive,"what a great help j.d was , such great customer service and great work on my car ! 10/10 recommendation . 

took my car back to sun auto needed some minor repairs with the transmission . what would i say , who needs a dealership when i have found friendly and trustworthy mechanics at sun auto . these men are servicing me in my best interest and not worried about filling their pockets ! the master mechanic jerry was very knowledgeable about all makes and models of vehicles. also patrick was a pleasure to work with !"
307,positive,"leo is seriously the best. he got us out of quite the pickle today.

it was our last day vacationing in vegas when the key got stuck in my 2014 jetta. couldn't get the car to shut off. shortly after, my check engine light came on, the transmission was clunking, and i couldn't accelerate past 50mph without the car buzzing and making all sorts of sounds. it looked like we were gonna break down. we knew there was no way we'd make it back to la. i quickly searched for a mechanic nearby and all the ones in this plaza either wouldn't help us, or gave us some sort of schtick. 

on a last ditch effort, i walked in to auto xperts asking if there was anything they could do for us. leo was courteous, compassionate, and willing to help. he got my car in without an appointment and they started trying to diagnose the issues within 10 minutes of me being there. he also offered us sodas, charging cables, and cut on a movie for us to watch.

he started out by giving me an estimate for the diagnostics and quickly got to work. he and his techs did not do any work without first asking my permission. leo was honest with me when he said he could not fix the key ignition issue, which i figured. the parts would have to be ordered and he recommended i take it to my dealership to get that fixed because it is still under warranty. 

after they checked my car from top to bottom, they were able to fix my transmission issue in an hour flat and i paid a lot less than what he originally quoted me. awesome! he then explained everything they did, bit by bit, and even explained some in-depth info on the car's internal computer codes. after a quick test drive, we were good to go, safe to make the 400 mile trip back home. 

leo never once tried to haggle me and never talked down to me like i was stupid. he treated me and my boyfriend with respect. he runs his business with honesty and integrity, and i would recommend him to any of my friends in a heartbeat."
308,positive,"i did not know a lot about smogs since previous to coming here, i had never failed a smog.  so when i took my car there and before the diagnostic was done-- my car failed the smog, and i was really upset.  i had no idea that having a check engine light on was an automatic fail.  and my light was on when i smogged the car.  i was upset that the technician did not warn me so i did not waste my money and could return once the light was turned off.  so i called the manager and asked why the guy could not warn me so that i could have saved my money, and he explained that it is against the law for them to coach me.  that the dmv checks by sending people who try to break the law to ensure that the garage is compliant.  that i could call the dmv to verify this.  (and i did; it is true.) however, i explained that i did not understand this and was upset that the money for the smog was wasted when all my car needed was a $15 dollar part.  so the manager agreed that he would let me resmog my car at no extra charge once the car was repaired.  i went in resmogged my car and passed, and it was all done in under 15 minutes.  i gave this location 5 stars, because they went out of their way to make a new customer.  i appreciate that the manager allowed me to resmog my car for free due to my previous lack of knowlege of how smogs work.  i believe that 5 star businesses give you the excellent service you expect.  i believe that some businesses deserve a 6 star rating when they go above and beyond excellent service to earn your business.  so the main point of this review is this: 1) never smog your car with the check engine light on and 2) this is an excellent business with an superb manager.  i gave them 5 stars, but if yelp allowed a 6th star for extra credit i would.  great job! many thanks, colleen"
