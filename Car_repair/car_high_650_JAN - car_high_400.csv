positive,"Grant his crew have been amazing. Had a few different repairs done there and very happy. Got a used car that knew needed work. Took it to BMW and they quoted me $2700 for the cooling system. Munich did a full repair on that, plus a valve cover gasket plus fixed another leak and found that my check engine light was bc a bad air/fuel mixture and the total repair was less than one at BMW. Then had my shift mechanism go out after I picked it up from those repairs and was like ""this is weird"". Talked to Grant and he said there wasn't a direct connection to their work as they were in a different part of the car but was willing to fix it at cost using a used part with a warrantee and it runs great. 

Had them do a little more like a battery and stuff and they will defiantly be my shop of choice. Having a German car isn't cheap but finding someone in the battle with you is key!"
positive,Okay guys what the hell... did you open up the transmission and fix it or did you put the timming belt back on like just right? It's seriously never ran this great before it used to not shift gears very well at all now it drives like a dream and all you supposedly fixed was the radiator?  I don't believe it my friend. Will be back for some more of that magic touch!
positive,"Mike and the rest of the guys down at 5 Star Auto Repair are absolute lifesavers! If I could give them more stars, I would! After my check engine light came on in my Lexus IS300, I was praying it was just a bad O2 sensor but quickly learned that the catalytic converter needed to be replaced. After a dealer quote of $4000 (which is more than I paid for the car), I went down to 5 Star Auto to get a quick estimate. 

Not only was I impressed with the price Mike was able to work out for me, I was thrilled to be able to schedule an appointment for the following monday (3 days after I came in...including weekend days). True to his word, Mike had my IS done on time and even went the extra mile to clean my lifetime air filter. The car runs like a dream, and I couldn't be happier! Wish I could keep these guys a secret but that would truly be a disservice to the community. Thanks, again, Mike and the rest of the team at 5 Star Auto! You guys rock!"
positive,"Did a muffler delete here with my GTI. I highly recommend this shop, Russ works pretty hard and knows what he's doing. Extremely reasonable price as well as it's much cheaper than anything else around town. Easy 5 stars"
positive,"I was referred here by another mechanic that did not do transmission work. They where able to replace my clutch in a reasonable amount of time, even though they where extremely busy at the time. The staff and owner is very friendly, open and upfront as far as cost and repair times. 
They worked with me even when we ran into an unexpected issue during the repair. I will use them again for any car repairs that I may have in the future. Please be advised that this is a really busy shop, so call ahead and make an appointment."
positive,"I have a 2013 Ford Fusion and unfortunately my transmission broke down.  Carlos Luna-Aispuro was my Service Advisor and he made a very ugly situation quite bearable and in the end it turned out to be great.  When I purchased my car I bought the extended warranty and as Carlos assured me it was the ""Mercedes"" of warranties. When my car broke down I was leaving for our summer trip to Boston and of course I was panicked about what this might cost me.  Carlos assured me that everything will work out and I should just go and enjoy my vacation.  I did and upon my return my car was still waiting to be approved for the warranty and Carlos gave me a free loaner which was a 2017 Ford Explorer.  When my car work was completed I ended up with a new transmission and an additional 12 months or 12,000 mile warranty on all my parts.  To be honest when I first turned in my car I thought to myself ""this car is a lemon and I am going to get rid of this and go across the street and trade it in.""  However, my whole attitude changed when I realized how Ford stood by their cars and I walked out of the dealership with my car and a new transmission AND zero money out of pocket.  I will be keeping my car thanks to the AWESOME customer service from Carlos and staying with Ford because they stand behind their automobiles."
positive,"If anyone had told me that I could find an auto repair shop in Las Vegas that would fix my out-of-town vehicle quickly and fairly, I would have laughed.  After having my car repaired at Tony's, I can say I have found an honest, efficient, and reasonable-priced car repair facility in Las Vegas (Sorry Charlie, previous reviewer,  but I can't believe you went to the same facility as me)  After having Dennis at A-1 tow my car to Tony's (Dennis and his new hire were very nice), Tony called to say that he would check everything out and get back with me.  About 3 hours later, Tony said that the car was almost finished and that all the pumps were in good condition, and only the belts and pulley needed to be replaced.  He took the car for an extended drive to check everything out before I tried to make it back home to SoCal.   I am very impressed with the quality of service at Tony's, the reasonable charge for the prompt repair, and have already told all of my friends in Vegas.   Thanks again Tony!!"
positive,"My check engine light was on, so I called and then stopped by. Bobby diagnosed the problem in a couple minutes, told me what parts I needed, and installed them for free when I went back. What amazing service!

Since my car has over 130k miles, a few things have been going wrong lately. Next time I have an issue, I will take my car back to 5 Star Auto Repair -- the name is fitting!"
positive,"You'll likely be dealing with Dale who will be a refreshing change from most shops. He does amazing work and will not charge you a dime more than required to fix your vehicle and keep his shop open. I was quoted over $300 for a thermostat replacement at Ted Weins took it to specialized auto care and Dale did it for $120.50. Since the part was actually 120 on rock auto I can only come to the conclusion he charged me 50 cents in labor.... Maybe he had an extra or got a deal on them in bulk but either way I couldn't even have done it myself for cheaper considering shipping costs! I can honestly say I have no need to shop around anymore this is my mechanic. Also if he can't do it he will refer you to another trustworthy place that can, in my case it was advanced mufflers right up the street which also received a 5 star review from me. Last thing, never go to a Ted Wiens/Firestone."
positive,I was in a jam and on panic mode after my Expedition failed a smog test due to check engine light being on. I went to 3 mechanic shops and didn't feel like I could trust the prices they were throwing out to me. I called Purrfect Auto Repair and spoke with Mike. He said bring the vehicle to him and they will try and squeeze me in to their busy schedule. The diagnostic was fairly cheap compared to other quotes I got prior to them and the diagnostic fee goes towards the repairs if you accept the work to be done. They managed to fix the issues and let me pick up my vehicle at the end of the day! I'm very satisfied with the service I received! Thank you to all of you at Purrfect Auto Repair! Good looking out Mike!
positive,I got a new muffler put on my new 2015 4x4 Dodge Ram 1500. I was referred here by 4 wheel part and was extremely happy with my results. They had the muffler put on in 45 minutes with no appointment for an extremely fair price. I am very happy. My truck roars!
positive,Great shop fast and inexpensive muffler sounds great I had a missfire in my engien that cause my cat to go bad they found out and had it fixed with the mechanic shop next door
positive,"Brian and his Body Works team is a first class business.  I would not think of going to another body shop.  They are very trustworthy and really care about their customers. The customer service is second to none!  Having your car repaired after an unexpected accident is not a pleasant thing to do.  Brian is very helpful in reviewing your options, and keeping you posted on the progress of your repairs.  They even have an online feature that keeps you posted on the repair progress along with costs and pictures of your automobile.
I have told all my friends at work about The Body Works Plus shop and their superior service.  This is also a very clean and safe shop.

You will not go wrong taking your car to this shop."
positive,"Got an oil change using Groupon and was waiting to told of all the things that where wrong with car. That didn't happen, they let me know the state of my brakes and tires and that the check engine light was on. They let me know they could check this if I wanted. I like the fact that they gave me options and did throw out a list  of every possible issue. Game room is pretty cool."
positive,I took my van in because the check engine light came on.  They ran the diagnostic test and looked at my transmission. They saw it needed replacement. They called the dealership to see if it was covered. It was and they brought my van over to the dealership.  It was my first visit. Their helpfulness and honesty will bring me back again for basic maintenance.
positive,With C&R tire I have had nothing but pleasant experiences. The other day I thought my truck needed something new in the front end and I was going to shell out a thousand bucks but they took care of me like they always have and tightened my skid plate and replaced my gas cap no more no and no more check engine light my father always took his vehicles there and so will I!
positive,I brought in my Dodge Stratus because I had severe transmission issues. Hamid gave me a quote that sounded very reasonable for the work performed. Picked up my car this morning and I'm very happy with the result. A bit of a new car feeling again. He pointed out some other things that need attention but without being pushy. I'll come back!
positive,"This place rocks! We were on a family road trip through Wisconsin when our van broke down not far from Madison. I called over a dozen auto repair shops, none of whom would take us in on such short notice with possible transmission issues. Then I called Wilde East Towne Honda and spoke with Nick Moderson-Kox in the service department. He found time to inspect our van that same morning and soon discovered the issue wasn't very serious and they could fix it while we waited. They made the necessary repairs, checking in with us often, as we hung out in the waiting area with our three children and our dog. We had been toying with the idea of purchasing a different vehicle so we ended up taking a test drive and looking at some options with Chris Alexander in the sales department as well. 

Although we didn't purchase a new vehicle that day (we needed to get back on the road), we hope to in the near future. Wilde Honda is located five hours from our house, but we are still talking about going back there when we decide to buy our next vehicle because of the great staff there. I would highly recommend this place."
positive,"I took my vehicle to Oasis for a transmission flush and a coolant flush today, I was very impressed with the managers (justin) honesty and professionalism. The price was very fair and the work was done in a very timely manner. 
I brought my vehicle in based on the recommendation of some family members, and after this first impression I plan on being a long term customer. Every positive review about Oasis seems completely accurate based on my experience.
Finally, an honest mechanic shop!"
positive,"Wow...
So, the other day (and this would have to happen after a difficult day, making it MORE difficult,) I was on my way home when my car started sounding like a rocket ship. 
My old Toyota (edging up on 200,000 miles, yep, I drive em hard,) had a blow out in the connecting pipe between the muffler and converter. Previously, I'd had folks tell me I needed a whole new muffler system, and I'm not rich, so the 1200 to 1500 they were quoting me was just too much. 
I was sort of desperate, and asked around. After talking to my Brother-In-law and doing some research online, I found All Star Discount Muffler...

And was amazed...

All Star is located just off of W.130th in an unassuming neighborhood. Now, when I headed out there I was told; GET THERE EARLY. They only do things by first come, first serve. No reservations. Why?

They're that FREAKING BUSY!! (and that freaking GOOD.)
They opened the gates at 8:30 AM, and as I and two more vehicles drove in...so did a dozen more. People from all over bring their cars in JUST BY WORD OF MOUTH, and the mix of people, from housewives to businessmen to even other mechanics shows how trusted these folks are. 

 The place is no-frills; there's some benches in the main office area, and you can wait or come back, but I'll tell you, you don't have to wait long. 

The staff like Dave and Amy are thoughtful, efficient and what I like about it is that Dave took me under my vehicle and showed me what they were going to do and then quoted me a price. 

I didn't need a whole system; I needed a pipe between the converter and the muffler, which was still quite good and didn't need replacing. That was it. 

With parts and labor folks; 40$ and in and out in about 40 minutes. 

Again, this is no frills, but they will NOT GYP YOU!  I saw testimonials here, on other review sites, and there were a dozen or more on a peg board in the office written on business cards, stationary and formal letterhead. People are thankful for great service and a good deal. 

(Heck, while I was there, two guys from OTHER AUTO PLACES brought cars in to be repaired because they couldn't. :) Also, all of their work carries guarantees as long as you keep your receipts, and I've heard they honor the work they do.  

So, if you want to be treated well, and get All Star prices, try All Star Discount Muffler for your brake, shock, and exhaust needs; you're wallet and your car will thank you:)"
positive,"The best of the best.. my transmission was making a humming noise so I took my car to them to have it checked. To make the story short, they called the Nissan Dealership and I received a new transmission at no cost despite being a salvage car! I only paid $60 to this shop! They are very honest mechanics."
positive,Terry just saved me over $4500! I had a different shop tell me my transmission was shot. I got a 2nd opinion from Terry's and thankfully he was honest and didn't find anything wrong! Will only go to Terry's from now on.
positive,"I came in yesterday as my check engine light came on while I was driving to Las Vegas from LA.  I also was due for an oil change.  They changed my oil, diagnosed my check engine light and confirmed I was safe to drive back to LA on the check engine light all within an hour while providing me a comfortable place to sit and a complementary soda.  I was so impressed I wanted to have them complete the repairs for my check engine light but I ended up needing to  rush back to LA.  If I ever find my self stranded in Vegas again I know who I will call.  Now I have to find a shop near me that I hope is even half as reliable as Busy Buggy."
positive,"These guys are the best !!! Honest, dependable, reliable mechanics. They help me out!  They could have made $500 for an transmission. But they said it was fine and didn't charge me. Sun Auto Service."
positive,"I'm surprise to read the other reviews on this location. I was in desperate need of an oil change. I put it off way too long. I pulled in on Sunday morning at 8:55am and they were ready and willing to take me right away. They open at 9am. I was quoted a price right away. $49. I don't mind because they check air filters, tires, transmission and such. I needed to clean my oil but I waited too long to get it changed and for $13 dollars it's worth it. I definitely needed at air filter was well. My old one was black! Also they knew my left driver's side blinker was out and offered to change it for me. Luckily I had the bulb in my car and they switched it out for me for $5 bucks. I've never had better service and was out of there in 20 minutes!"
positive,"This place is still as good as it gets. I have gotten many oil changes here, and they are always able to fit me in a pinch. Today I had taken my car to troubleshoot the tire pressure sensor system, and it is a hard thing to troubleshoot.  They had checked the sensors and could not find why it was happening and recommended me to Ford. They didn't charge me for their troubleshooting, which was highly appreciated. 

If you need your car repaired or anything done, I would recommend this place hands down.

Every time I have been here the prices have been more than fair and the service has been some of the best that I have ever had. I personally cannot do oil changes and troubleshoot my car in my apartment complex (as it is against their policies), so this is definitely the next best option."
positive,"Second time to Rebel Automotive, had oil change and transmission fluid change.  Super fast.  Took my daughter and we played in the arcade, she had a blast."
positive,"Sept 17, 2016
At 4 a.m. We were leaving Las Vegas and as we were 35 minutes out our transmission blew. We called AAA and waited for 30 minutes. During our wait we called several auto places which we're closed due to the day being Sunday. Then we saw this company Busy Buggy!!!! They are open 23/7,  I have to say my heart was lifted when this gentlemen said YES! We can get the part and have the truck (1997 Chevy Tahoe) ready by Monday no later then 6 p.m. Whew what a relief to hear that. We had free shuttle from Busy Buggy to the hotel, they have complimentary Coffee, drinks, ice cream, and snacks. It made us feel like they understood what we just went through and having something to eat for free was just a way to say it will be okay. In conclusion we are on the road, the truck is running excellent, and we feel safe for the long drive home. 
As for the professional mechanics, we learned that each mechanic are well experienced and they love what they do, FIX CARS! I give this company a 5 STAR rating in the categories: Customer Service (honesty), Post performance (transmission installation), and complementary amenities (drinks, and snacks). 
Thank you Busy Buggy and the crew that worked on our 1997 Chevy Tahoe LT

The Marmon's (Tracy Ca)"
positive,"I'm so glad I found an honest and inexpensive place I can take my car to I took my car in for an oil change and a transmission drain +refill, and they finished the job within a couple of minutes. There was absolutely no waiting time because the mechanic was so quick and efficient. Not just that, they rotated my tires and checked my tire pressure for free. My car runs better than it's ever run before now. This place is the only place I will bring my car from now on. 
The tricky thing about this place is that it is located behind a few restaurants, so it's a little hard to find."
positive,Needed a piece of tube bent for a project.  turned out that the tube I had wouldn't bend right with their bender. They had the same size pipe but different type in stock that would work for my project (non exhaust related) they bent it to my specs in just a few mins and didn't cost much at all.  Ended up fitting perfect.  thank you pro muffler will be back for a flowmaster in the future.
positive,"These guys straight up rock! It's very nice to find a local shop that gives you fast honest estimates that are very detailed. They solve the problem and get the job done very quickly. Personal calls from the mechanics to let you know how the job is coming along. Everything just seems to go better at Crawfords! Job done right, fast, and all at the best prices around! I don't go anywhere else. Oil change, tune-up, brakes, muffler, tires, or any engine repair...they do it all. Check them out next time you need ANY auto service or repair."
positive,Was a little unsure as to what was needed with my car. I thought perhaps I needed a whole new muffler altogether which I was a bit apprehensive given I was almost broke but couldn't make it to my job with my vehicle dragging a broken muffler around. When I got there I was told he would try and look at it today as he was short a guy. I called during lunch to see if they'd gotten a look at the car and what it'd need and voila they had it all set to be picked up and they welded the two parts of my dual exhaust back together costing me a total of $40. I had to have him repeat the amount like 3 times because it just sounded too good to be true. I will be a returning customer for as long as I live here. I appreciate your help guys! Couldn't be happier!
positive,"So, I'm usually never really blown away by most places customer service, but Chris and his team at the Valvoline on Elkhorn and Grand Montecito nailed it. I had been having some issues with my transmission and wanted to see what was going on with the car. Chris greeted me with a smile and listened carefully as I explained what was going on. He not only offered to look at the transmission, but did checks on all fluid levels, belts, filters, brakes and tires. He took the time to explain in detail what he was checking for and what required immediate service and what didn't. I was so impressed by his ethic that I decided to get the work done. Not only did he get the work done in a timely manner, he also got me a discount on some of the work. I will be bringing my car back here frequently and highly recommend this location to anyone who values a great customer service experience!"
positive,"I brought in our Range Rover in for service because the check engine light was on.  Service agent Ana was very helpful and set me up with a loaner car for the day because I had to get to work.  Ana called me within 3 hours and my car issue was resolved!  Thank you Ana for making it a smooth service with my repair!  Hope to not be back anytime soon, but if I do, I'll be back to see Ana!"
positive,"My usually reliable vehicle decided out start acting up the day my hubs & I decided to roll out to Las Vegas for our One Year Anniversary. For some reason, it sounded like it wouldn't shift the gear (I have an automatic & I don't know much about vehicles) and wouldn't ""climb"" hills. When we pulled into Treasure Island's parking garage & the uphill driveway, my car started shaking and lights started flashing. Dude. Really. 

We waited until the next day (Today, Monday) & took it in. Edward helped us out as soon as he got off the phone & let me know he can diagnose it. Then, Gustavo pulled up & drove us back to TI - with my car so he can see what we're talking about. Nice.

About two/three hours later - Ed calls me to let me know there are damaged wires that connect to the computer that talks to my transmission & it's basically telling it it's no good. (I had just received and oil change and tire rotation Friday. Wish it was caught then) 

$260 to repair. Truthfully not THAT bad, so I called back & said go for it. 

TIMELINE: 

9:30(ish) - Took it over 

11:30 - Edward called to tell me what was wrong 

12:55 - Edward called to tell me it was done. AWESOME!!! 

1:03 - Gustavo's at our hotel. AGAIN, AWESOME! 

We didn't even have to ask to be picked up and expected to have to take a Taxi or walk. They didn't even charge for that. 

The owner - I'm assuming from reading reviews, came out to ring us out & let me know what else it needed. I was grateful.

Yelp, you did exactly what you were created to do. Busy Buggy - so did you."
positive,"I DO NOT like taking my vehicles to a shop.  But when its 6000 degrees outside, i can't stand being in the garage. Joe at Sun Auto talked to me respectfully, and gave me a diagnosis/quote of my problem early the next day. I am pretty comfortable working on vehicles old and new, and i thought i had already pinpointed the problem as a transmission issue.  If they had told me so, they could have ripped me off easily by telling me i needed a rebuild. "" Luckily"" it was brake noise, and required a front brake job.  It was not cheap, but sometimes peace of mind that a job is done right, is worth paying for.  You can probably find cheaper prices, but i will certainly give them business again if i needed help."
positive,"I haven't even had my car repaired yet, and already I want to give the Hargraves team five stars, but I'm giving them four just to be reasonable. I will update when I've completed business with them. This is the first time I've written a review before my my transaction was complete with a business, but because my treatment has been so good I'm doing a review now. I was involved in an accident (other person's fault) that totaled my car. I had it dropped off at Hargraves at the recommendation of my mechanic and every interaction has been professional and kind. The team at Hargraves (with special kudos to David and Scott) have consistently gone above and beyond to keep me informed and updated about the status of my vehicle. This has been important because the slimeball who hit me was a used car salesman from Europa Auto Sales and when the police officer took his information, he lied about who owned the car and who's insurance was responsible (it's Europa's responsibility, but they've been scumbags and won't release their information, so I'll have to get a lawyer *sigh*) Fortunately the team at Hargraves is a rare example of a business who sincerely works for their customer's best interest."
positive,"My old 320ml decided to cause me problems - it was stuck in low range and wouldn't shift out.  I took it to Sun Devil Auto who have done most of the recent maintenance on the suv (very competently I might add) and advertise that they do transmission work.  To their credit, they were unfamiliar about working on an old Mercedes and recommended going to a Mercedes speciality shop.

I've gone through a few Mercedes shops and have had little issues with each, so I decided to try European Auto Salon on 7th St.  Glad I did.

They were able to get me in the next morning.  They tried to find a simple solution, but of course few Mercedes' issues are ever simple.  But after dropping me off at work, they called an hour later with the diagnosis and estimate that proved to be right on.

After lunch, the car was ready and I drove away - a little poorer, but happy to have found a new shop I trust."
positive,"Great service. Great prices.  They were able to fix my car within the day. And even offered me a ride back to work. They are very knowledgeable about the German cars. And their prices for their service is on par with other people who do not specialize in German cars. 

So I really feel you're getting a great deal from these guys. If you want your car repaired with authentic OEM parts. Then these are your guys."
positive,"Thanks to Lamborghini of Las Vegas (this is a not accurate when they are based in Henderson!) I sold my 2010 Lamborghini 560-4 Spyder to a Lambo dealer in CA and I will never own another Lambo.  Terrible and arrogant sales manager basically laughed at me when I called him about a trade difference on a new Aventador LP-700 saying there was no market for my car and he did not have any Aventadors unless I paid him $80,000 over the already absurd list price of $400,000 range.  I own a new Ferrari California I bought from the Penske-Wynn Las Vegas dealer and Tony  the sales person and Rich the service manager are beyond awesome, opposite of these jerks.  Also the Ferrari is far superior compared to the Lambo with better dual clutch transmission, far nicer interior, vastly superior technology in the GPS, monitoring LCDS and far superior sound system plus a hard top conv for about the same price as my prior Lambo.  I will never sell or trade my Ferrari California but when I decide to buy another amazing sports car it will be a new Ferrari when they come out with a new model to blow away the Aventador!

positive,"This is the second time I have brought my car to them.  First time my check engine light was on.  They came out to check it tighten my gas cap and reset the light.  Then set me on my way no charge!  
This time my temperature gauge said it was overheating.  Drove to their shop and they even drove me down the street back to work!  I was scared it was the radiator and was going to be serious.  Got a call that it was just the gauge that was broken and everything else was fine.  They fixed it for a very reasonable price!  It is awesome to find honest mechanics.  Most shops will take advantage of people.  Will for sure be back!"
positive,"My tc light was on and with that comes the check engine light.  That Thursday on the way home my engine oil pressure light came on but then went right off.  Taking a flight that night, had to wait til I came back.  In the meantime, E's car didn't start on Monday so in his went also.  They had to keep his overnight (waiting on stupid warranty ppl).  So Tuesday I drive my car to BB and drop it off.  Marco is always so pleasant but no matter how sweet he is I'm always scared to my whits end about the cost.  They take E and I to work.  Long story short, car had no oil...wtf (I know I know, you think Im a girl and don't know any better but that's not true lol  I have a sensor that tells me when to get my oil change but apparently that isn't working).  How is that even possible and why didn't my engine oil pressure light stay on?  Anyways, not BB's problem.  Gave me an oil change (I was at 4% but clearly that tracking device isn't working lol)  Marco called and said everything is fine.  I was 99.99999% certain the TC light would come back on.  I told Marco to just go ahead and change whatever.  He said Lynette, let's just wait and see.  I was kinda adamant about just changing the sensor and he said Lynette I mean I can if you insist but let's really just wait and see.  
Welp, it's been almost 2 weeks and it's stayed off (knock on wood).  IDK if Marco was scared of my tears again lol and said just fix it so she doesn't come back lol or if the sensor was on due to the nail that was in my damn tire.  Anywho...what I thought was going to potentially be a $500+ job, turned out to be under $60 :)  And Ed's car was also back up and running and we both left w our cars on Tuesday.  I can't express enough how honest these guys are and how they do everything  possible to not make the damage so bad!
As always, with sincere thanks and gratitude, LC"
positive,"I was incredibly nervous about taking my car to a major chain as I've heard and read many mixed reviews about numerous locations. My experience at this Aamco was fantastic though!

Larry was incredibly kind and helpful in explaining what was wrong with my transmission, and when it came time to fix it, he ended up charging me the originally estimated cost even though he needed to do a little extra work. 

Can't recommend this place enough!"
positive,"Got a great deal on my new tires.  I just happened to be getting some work done over at the muffler shop in the same area.  I needed new tires too and just walked in, no appointment or call.  We went over the options i chose to put on 4 new BF Goodrich Adv. TA sports, great price and service, friendly, nice waiting area too.  Was done all in the same day as they had the tires at nearby warehouse they just had to simply get them.  Did an alignment and car is smooth and tires feel good.  Thanks again!"
positive,"I live in Los Angeles and drove out to Henderson to visit my brother who lives here. My check engine light came on, I brought my car here just by chance to get it checked out. These guys are awesome, honest and know what they are doing, I highly recommend them!"
positive,"I buy a transmission over 1,300 dlls for my mustang they shipped a wrong item after wait  7 day in the middle of the new year holidays but also i consider weather road conditions at this time of the season a lot of snow in many states the thing is mistakes happen  is not a perfect business doesn't matter what kind of business but what is matter is customer service attitude they realize  is a mistake that it has to be fix it maybe not them but it maybe a vendor mistake just because they sold the product is them the one who has to fix the issue. after they make some calls they order other transmission for another vendor they apologize and explain to me that if it was for them they will have the transmission ready in the same day but as a customer we have to understand that are limitations for every situation 
managers are employees as well and they have limitations but what really matter is the effort they put into a customer complain Paul the store manager care about his customers same as his employees i could just get my money back and go buy it some where else but it will take days also to be deliver, it maybe send the wrong or broken item as well and even worst who knows it maybe be a good or bed customer service so i just decided to let them order the other from a different vendor

i like this auto zone store"
positive,"Thanks to Yelp, I found this awesome car repair shop.  I have nothing but the absolute BEST things to say about them.  The most professional, honest and effecient that I have ever worked with.  Unfortunately, I just bought a ""lemon"" and 25th St. Automotive took some of the pain out this process.  They are just amazing....I knew that the transmission was most likely shot.  They spent the minimum amout of time and money to confirm this and were more than accomodating.  I would bring another car back here in a heartbeat. 

Overall, a it's very dismal circumstance regarding my newly purchased used car, but an absolutely fabulous experience with 25th Street Automotive."
positive,"If you visit Aamco at the Van Buren St. location, ask for Corey. Very knowledgeable and personable. If you have transmission problems this is the guy to go see!"
positive,"A while back I took my 4Runner in for a transmission estimate because the dealership said that ALL test came back and that I needed a $3640 rebuilt transmission put in. i took it to Oasis since I started doing oil changes there. They said they didn't believe the transmission was the issue but the timing belt itself. They ask if they could pull the covers and inspect inside and YES it was that. I was so PLEASED to get out for about $550 and my truck runs great. They have all of my future repairs and referrals. Thanks guys!

positive,These guys are great. I was able to get my jeep Cherokee in and out within a couple of hours. Price was reasonable for a cat back exhaust with a magnaflow muffler installed. My only gripe is they didn't have anymore stickers... My jeep could always use more stickers to hold it together and keep it from falling apart.
positive,"At first I was skeptic if I should take my car there. Being I've been scammed when I bought the car from a private seller in the first place. But what the heck! 

The office was extremely clean (and it smelled nice too!) something you might not expect from a repair shop. Refreshment bar was well stocked & I mean REALLY well stocked. Hmmm, not your typical repair shop AGAIN. and they have a CLEAN bathroom! Imagine that! AGAIN, not typical for a car repair shop. With that said, let's get down to the real deal..

Mr. Hamid (I'm guessing he's the licensed lead mechanic) was very welcoming. Received us timely & was very attentive to our concerns about the car. I was telling him the details & I guess he figured out that i was upset about the car being a junk, he told me they'll check the car out & tell me what's wrong. Offered me some refreshments & magazines while I wait. He came back saying something's off with the transmission. What?! TRANSMISSION?! I almost fainted! Man! One thing over the other, quoted me the amount me the amount I expected -- but still I was like, lemme look around..

Got a second opinion & boy!! They quoted me 4x as much for the same problem BUSY BUGGY diagnosed my car for! Long story short, took my car back to them & after 2days, whoollaaa!!! My car started running like brand new!! Plus, it included 1 year warranty!!! Damn!! One whole year!! I'm a fan!! Spreading the word over the valley. This is the to go place if you want QUALITY & HONEST service."
positive,"I took a company van, a 2005 Chevrolet Express with 300,000 miles in for transmission and brake service this week. The price was half the cost of other garages where I knew the owners, and they found solutions that for a problem no one else would have found, or cared about. I am just like all the other reviewers here, happy and satisfied with the service, communication, and pricing I received from the staff at Choice Auto Repair. I highly recommend you take any vehicle problems or regular service needs to them. They have the experience, the products, and the right attitude to help you stay on the road, for the best price possible, just like they did with me. They believe in themselves, and in your experience with them. If there was a 10 star rating, I would give it."
positive,"I love my car. Perhaps to an unhealthy level. I just have to put that out on the table immediately in attempt to add some weight to the following statements.

Since I found Goodspeed, when I am working on my car, I look to Goodspeed first. I go here for my oil and filters (They've got Motul oil. Simply the best!) I went here when I had trouble with my air intake and they helped me sort it out. When I started getting a check engine light related to my turbo, I went in here with my suspicions of the cause. I talked to Jon for a couple minutes to describe the problem, he reached under the counter, pulled out a part and said ""This is what you need right here."" And guess what? He was right!

I will continue referring my friends here, and going here for all my needs, most especially when I start doing more serious tuning of my car. I may live 30 miles away, but it's absolutely worth the trek."
positive,"This five star review goes to the service department. I took my car in earlier to run a diagnostic on a possible transmission issue. Sure enough, my car needs a new transmission, and it is totally covered by Nissan because it is under warranty. 

When I first dropped off my car in the morning, the service team set me up with a free shuttle service to work. They even went out of their way to ask a live team member to give me a ride so I wasn't late because the shuttle driver was going on the opposite end of town. During work, they called and let me know the issue, said that the car won't be fixed until Monday and they will set me up with a rental, all on Nissans dime. When I go to get the rental after work, it was ready for me within 10 minutes. 

Wonderful customer service from all members I encountered!"
positive,"This is the only place to go for exhaust work.  Three years ago I had a discount muffler shop put in a full replacement exhaust system on a Honda that had lasted 16 years, their new one was completely rusted out with holes the size of golf balls everywhere in just three years.  Turns out all these muffler places including the chain stores use crappy thin aluminized  pipe that won't survive the corrosive winters much longer than 3 years. They will all tell you the same story and that this situation is your only choice outside of outrageously priced exhaust parts from the dealer which are made of much higher quality materials.  Good for them but a complete waste of money vs the value you receive.  Steve's is the only place I found after lots of research where you can get a stainless exhaust fabricated and installed that is as durable as the factory system and is much lower cost than the highly overpriced factory dealer parts  They are super folks to deal with, they give you the straight info and regular communication on your repairs, they get the job done quickly, it is right the first time and pricing is very fair.  You can't ask for more."
positive,"I'm not a big fan of the ""big service"" shops.  I like to find my neighborhood mechanic, or that ""small shop"" that gives you an honest evaluation and fair prices.  However, I had an alignment coupon for Car X, so I brought my vehicle in there for the deal.  Part of the deal is a free 30-point inspection, which I welcomed being that we're going on a big road trip in 2 days.

The visit stopped at the inspection.  The guy at the counter (K.C.) brought me back to the van to meet the mechanic (Marshall) and show me a few things.  First, the tie rod end was loose and needed replacing.  And I thought, ""uuuuugh, here it comes...""  But they were kind enough to SHOW me how it was loose, and tell me that's an easy job that I could do myself (having talked earlier about doing my own struts, brakes, etc.).  So wow - thanks for that!  They also pointed out the serpentine belt, which I kinda knew was overdue.  

While K.C. typed up an estimate, Marshall sat down with me to talk about the vehicle (which he knows a TON about).  He gave me some good advice on the key things to do to make it last a long, long time.  Free advice - how awesome!  Additionally, he gold-starred my decisions on struts and shocks - a choice that I had fretted about, but now feel vindicated.  

So tonight I get to replace my tie rod end and bring it back to them for alignment.  And, for their hospitality, I'll throw in an overdue transmission flush job.  Great job, guys!"
positive,"I am a senior lady and I was referred to Chuck's by my to have maintenance check on my car.  I have always changed my oil, set my spark plugs for tune up on 75 chevy malibu...lets just say I love to work on cars.  Well I'm older and the newer cars are more complicated.  I'm from OH where I had a great mechanic.  I was highly recommended to Chucks and I must say I received a blessing that day.  I only needed a tune up...the price was more than fair for my 2010 chevy malibu.( yes I love my chevys) The staff Paul and Harold were exceptionally professional and kind.  The shop was very neat for a auto repair business.  I will continue to take my car to this center and will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone that needs there car repaired.  In these times it is hard to find a fair, honest business who cares about individuals, well again I thank God for Chuck's Auto Service Center and I pray there business continue to grow and grow.  Bless you, and your families.  Your parents should be proud they have raised some honest, caring, hard working individuals.  Thank you again for your great service!!!"
positive,Eddies service was awesome! He replaced my transmission fluids in no time. He did it at a great price with great service.
positive,"I've brought a few cars here and I am always impressed with their reliability and honesty 
Today they're doing a big job that had I let it go would have been a new transmission 
I'm very happy they're always able to fit me in and always get it done the same day! 
Thanks"
positive,"Today l brought my mini van with damaged muffler. These guys are The Best... Every place I took my car they wanted to replace the entire part which cost arm and a leg. These guys do it the right way . Replacing just the section with damaged. Saved me lot of $$$.. 
The price they charged me was more than reasonable. Very friendly staff. They take appointment and take you in on time. I totally recommend these guys. If you have problems with muffler on your car stop looking around and drive down here to these guys no matter where you live in Las Vegas... I assure you it worth the drive. Thank you so much guys for doing suck a great work on my car. A+++++++"
positive,"Found this shop online searching and saw the great reviews here on Yelp. Brought in my 2010 F-150 Raptor because my Flowmasters were too obnoxiously loud at highway speeds, too much cabin drone. They are installing a Magnaflow muffler and piping right now. Super happy with the service and price. Definitely will come back for future work!!"
positive,"First, when you walk in, you'll notice the place just looks and feels so much cleaner than most auto-shops. Denelle I think is her name works the front desk, she was great, and she guessed my car's issue right just from my sound impersonation, hah! They checked it out while changing my oil, sure enough, same thing my other mechanic said. I had a coupon for a $20 oil change, but that is for regular oil and mine takes synthetic. They double checked that it can't take regular, and again, I know my usual guy uses synthetic as well, but to make it up they gave me the same $10 off the usual synthetic price, $60, which is exactly what I usually pay, so total was $50...and they checked my fluids, check engine light issue, as well as confirming the noise is the power steering pump. But what put it over the top was a MAILED thank you note, signed by them. Ok, I love my mechanic, but these guys are my new go-to for routine stuff. second opinions, and possibly big jobs if I want to make sure it's done well."
positive,"I came here to buy transmission oil and had no clue what I was doing. The sales associate actually checked my transmission level and found out I didn't even need it, and then helped me pick out new windshield wipers. He even offered to put the wipers on since I think he could tell that I was clueless. 

Will definitely come back."
positive,"I recently had my car repaired at Wolbert's.  I had some deep scratches, dents and a major crunch in the front end.  They did a fantastic 'bang up' job, and my car looks brand new!  If I could give them ten stars, I would.  I highly recommend them!!"
positive,"Took our car into a different shop to get the transmission fluid flushed because they charged a decent price. We go to pick up the car and they tell us we need all new brake pads and two new front rotors. I ask how much and the guy says $650 plus tax. I had to pick my jaw up from the ground. I was recommended to Choice Auto Repair by my dad and am so thankful I was!! Kevin was able to get us in first thing the next day. He called and informed us that only the front brake pads needed to be replaced and that he could resurface the front two rotors instead of replacing them. The grand total was $150 plus tax. This shop is awesome, I will never take any of my cars anywhere else. I really do appreciate their honesty and fair prices."
positive,"I stopped in to relax a minute, after having my car repaired.  I ordered the Carmel macchiato which I thoroughly enjoyed. I really liked the long community table, I met and chatted with some very friendly people from in and out of town.  Sure, the parking is cramped and the lot sucks, but I didn't come for that, I came for the coffee  and good service, which was spot on.  Thanks Starbucks."
positive,The best hands down for all your transmission needs! We are repeat customers and will always go here first rather than waist our time anywhere else. Super customer service!
positive,"Hands down the most honest service shop. 

I have a warranty with car max and my transmission has been funky ever since I got the darn car. It's only 3 years old (18 months I've had it) and it's never running correctly. I called carmax and of course they wanted to charge me $200 just to see it and the wait was two weeks to get an appointment. What da heck?! So I asked if I could get a rental til then and they said no, not til they say somethings wrong with it. Soooo, let me get this straight.. I'm supposed to drive a car that keeps dying on me while driving with two small kids in 110 degree weather.. wow. 

Sorry, getting to the point... 
so the warranty people recommend this place and I call. The gentleman on the phone was completely sweet, understanding and got me in the next day. I left my car there at 8am and when I picked it up he said it is skipping but not enough for the warranty to replace it and for now to be careful.. it may also just be bad gasoline. I knew that they looked at it so I had to pay the $80 inspection fee (as states on my warranty) and he was sweet and told me no they were waiving it since nothing was technically wrong. 

From start to finish I cannot explain how easy, simple, sweet and efficient they were. I will always go to them first with my business."
positive,"I was referred to Tony's by a Napa Warranty agent and quickly read their reviews. After feeling comfortable, I called them up and booked an appointment for the next day. Upon arriving, I was promptly greeted and made aware upfront that I would have a long wait time based on the repair I needed done. About 45 minutes later, Tony informed me that my repair was going to be pricey. Instead of him being money hungry, he talked with me and gave me his opinion...the repair would be more expensive than my car was worth and he didn't think it would be worth it. That could've been the end, HOWEVER, he went the extra mile to escort me to a dealership and put me in trusted hands. Thanks to Tony I was able to trade in my car and get a 2016 Chevy Cruze for an amazing price and he even went on a test drive with me to ensure I was satisfied with the purchase. Tony is the definition of a stand up guy and deserves everything good that comes his way. I didn't have the pleasure of getting my car repaired by him, but I will refer him to everyone I come across and will return if I ever need anything. He's honest, charismatic, and a great business man!"
positive,"There's a reason it helps to get an appointment for service at Bell Union Auto Service -- the word is out about how great this place is! 

Ken and the staff here are the real deal, honest, friendly,and they know what to do to fix it right. I had some check engine light issues and other warnings for service and it was time for maintenance on my Liberty. With 112,000miles, I anticipated the worst but they put everything right and included it all in the usual service rate, a fraction of the cost to visit a dealer. 

What I discovered is that they do only what is necessary -- no inflated charges -- no cashing in at my expense. I've tried the ""jiffy"" coupons and ""gruupy"" deals only to find they are simply looking to up charge for added unneeded services. Recently moved to Grayhawk and have been looking for an auto service I could really trust. So glad to have found Bell Union!"
positive,"Had to take my Altima in for a recall. Service staff was super helpful and friendly. They hooked me up with an Uber to and from the place which was super easy to use. I did have to pay $225 for transmission fluid change on my CTV tranny, which seemed like a lot, but the parts guy gave me a free touch up paint for a scratch so that was cool. Car cane back nice and clean. No complaints."
positive,Super service! T&M is probably the most honest auto shop in Vegas. They do great work whether its a transmission to changing the emission controls. I can't say enough and I can say that from experience as I worked in the auto repair business years ago while going to college.
positive,"I am pleased to update the fact that Brian, the current owner of Buddy's Auto Repair, has made things right. A couple of weeks ago I received a call and email from Brian about my experience and his desire to rectify what happened. It was just in time too, as my check engine light had been coming on an off. So, I took my truck in and was given a very thorough diagnostic exam for free. I ended up needing new plugs and sparks, along with a duct valve and Buddy's replaced all of that for $100. Additionally, they made sure that the loaner car had a full tank of gas. I am very happy and will, for sure, reach out to Buddy's in the future. I appreciate Brian's actions!"
positive,Brandon was awesome! He was able to do a code check for our check engine light. Unfortunately we have to take it to a speciality mechanic. We appreciated Brandon's superb customer service & his honesty.
positive,"Excellent service. Great and honest people... Got my engine oil, manual transmission and transaxle gear lube, transfer case lubricant, brake/clutch fluid and power steering fluid done today. Great price compared to Tireworks, Sears and the over rated Auto Pro shop. Joe who is the office, made me feel welcome. Al the mechanic did a great job. Thanks a whole lot to Tiffany Bautista-Medeiros for the help. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO GO EXCEL... Great honest people, Overall Great Company... Will return for routine maintenance for my EVO 9..."
positive,"So, I'll start this off by saying that no one ever likes to get their car repaired...especially in Arizona...and certainly when that repair is associated with the AC. Knowing full well the potential cost of the repairs, I approached my search for a repair shop with caution. 

TJ and the guys at Kinkade's were super awesome. TJ shot me a quote within the hour with two possible costs depending on how bad the ac was. Come to find out, it was the dreaded compressor that had gone out. TJ gave me options, letting me know what he recommended, but not pushing needless repairs on an already expensive situation. He was straight up and forward, and I am glad he was. My wife and two boys are now riding in a nice refrigerated chariot, facing these nasty summer temps. 

I will certainly be going back if I need anything else repaired. They made a painful situation very bearable."
positive,These guys made a terrible experience bearable during my last trip through Las Vegas. My transmission on my truck went out while towing my travel trailer through Las Vegas. Chris was extremely helpful. He tried to look for cost saving options for me and the work was done extremely fast.
positive,Richards Auto Clinic was great! I dropped my Jeep off that had been having issues for several months. Previously another mechanic had said that he couldn't figure out why my check engine light was on and that it was something I would just have to live with. My car was at Richards for only 2 days before he called with great news. He fixed all the issues that I was having in a timely manner and at a reasonable price. Even better- after asking if he had a military discount he gave me 10% off! Definitely head to this place if you are in the area.
positive,"Who in the world can actually BRAG about having an amazing mechanic? I CAN. 

Bob is the real deal. My family has taken a veritable fleet of cars to him over the past decade--Hondas, Toyotas, Mazdas, and a mid-90s POS Nissan. He has helped us with everything from the mundane (window switches, antennas) to the crucial (brakes, transmissions, A/C). His work ethic is unparalleled and he has gone above and beyond for us more times than we could count.

Tip: Don't complain if you find a lone cat sleeping in your back seat when you go to pick your car. It's part of the experience!  

They don't make 'em like this anymore, folks."
positive,"We just brought our car there to be taken care of. We were told by another auto place that we needed our brakes done and the transmission fluid done. Well we didn't and thank you the T & M Automotive for being honest. Never again will we take our vehicles to ""convenience"" places for oil changes and such. It's just not worth it. Our vehicles will only be coming here from now on!!"
positive,"I just had my car repaired with I-17 Collision. I am very thankful for the repair work done on my Mazda. You can not tell there was any damage doneThe paint matches perfectly, the staff was efficient, courteous, and very skilled.  My mechanic recommended me to this shop for the body repair and I can see why. They are experts! My thanks to Xavier, Rose, and the entire staff."
positive,"Very pleased with my service.  Had a transmission leak repaired, broken Windshield replaced, oil changed, smog certed and they had a tow truck pick it up from my home and add it to my bill so I didn't have to worry about it!  Friendly, professional, reasonable, and convenient:  A rare find in automotive repair!"
positive,"Brought my car in because check engine light was on. They were honest and upfront about the issues it could be. They explained all my options and even said they'd give me references because it was outside of the scope of work that they offer. Being a woman, it's refreshing to go to a place that isn't going to try and take advantage. They were all very knowledgeable and educated me on the issue with my car."
positive,"Hamid reached out to me and his customer service skills alone deserve the five stars. He has advised that he will be retraining staff members and seeking out for qualified technicians.  

 His comment back is incorrect regarding how many times I have visited, but that is probably due to my last name changing. 

Overall I am now satisfied with their service and I trust Hamid so that is what matters. 

---------Original review was one star and comments below


This place is appealing due to their high positive reviews and free cookies, which sold me even after they messed up on my car once before. It's hard finding a good mechanic and I figured maybe they were having a off day. 

Long story short twice they have repaired the wrong thing (tail light issues) which was fine with me since I caught it and they didn't try to charge me for the piece I didn't need. But what scares me is they also did work on my engine which is not so easily visible as a tail light. And now my check engine light is on.. Eeeekkk. 

I told the mechanic ""I don't  know how you have such great reviews."" And he replied ""well I'm actually a aircraft mechanic"" .. Um is that suppose to explain why you couldn't read my dashboard to know which tail light to replace or is that your way of saying you are above being a car mechanic?! 

The gentlemen at the front desk handled the situation very well but unfortunately they can't duplicate ten more of him. 

Sorry for the bad review but you need to hire better mechanics."
positive,"These guys are INSANE.  Again I thought I needed a ton of unnecessary things done on my car... and 25th Street Auto talked me OUT of them.  I was going to do a complete tear out and screen and gasket replacement in my transmission and Bill told me it was not needed and costly.  I think we need to call in the guys with the straight jackets!

Again a great motor and transmission oil change... and then found a tiny leak in my steering fluid that I will keep an eye on."
positive,"The staff members at Audi Chandler are some of the friendliest I've interacted with, from the salespeople to the financing department. I'd been kicking around the idea of getting an Audi as we needed to trade up from my compact hatchback to a car that can transport more than 2 people comfortably. I was interested in an A4 or an A5, and knew that Audi Chandler had a manual transmission A4 on the lot. I walked in on a Friday with about 15-20 minutes of free time before dinner and worked with Jorge to take a look at the interior and exterior of the two models. Before I left, I told Jorge that I would likely be back in on Saturday or Sunday for a test drive and he didn't pressure me at all.

I came back on Sunday and worked with Adora (turns out, Jorge wasn't working that day) and she let me test drive the manual A4 as well as an automatic A4 with no problems. I wasn't expecting to walk out on Sunday with an Audi, but Adora worked with me to get the deal I was looking for and that was that.

The whole process was pretty painless and I really didn't feel pressured, cornered, intimidated, uncomfortable, etc. throughout the better part of my afternoon. Nobody likes to spend the whole day at the dealership, but if I had to choose one, this would be a good choice."
positive,"I was so pleasantly surprised by the menu at Padres after being sent there by the Volkswagon service department up the road.  I was driving cross country with my boyfriend when the check engine light came on so we had to stop and it was just in time for lunch.

We ordered guacamole and chips which came with three types of salsa.  I had the palin salmon salad, which was cooked just right and had a perfect amount of mexican seasoning for a salad dish.  My boyfriend got the obama burrito, which was extremely tasty and huge!

All I can say is, I wish Padres was near where I live now!"
positive,"hold onto your hats....Ill try not to make this too lengthy.
Soooo took my car in for check engine light.  They called, explained what the (at the time) problem was and recommended some other things.  OK how much?  Oh boy.  Oh well. Get it done!
Marco was kind enough to drop me off at work (thanks Marco) and pick me up as well.  
Get my car, things are running smoothly.  Friday got off early, was going to stop at the casino to put in a bet and BOOM....wouldn't you know it.  Check engine light is back on.  (guess I wasn't supposed to bet that day lol) I called and they said bring it in.  They ran another diagnostic.  This time the throttle body or something was bad.  They tried to clean it to save me some money but that did not work.  Actually the cleaning made it worse.  They kept my car and offered me a loaner car (thanks again).  They had my car all weekend and finally Tuesday night they called to tell me it was ready.  I had just met my family from out of town for dinner so I said I will swing by in the am.  Got my car Wednesday am.  Work is literally 6 minutes down the road so I didn't get to give it a good test run.  Thursday, car running great.  Friday (personal time taken off to be w the fam) I hop in to go and meet the fam at dad's timeshare and 10 minutes into the car ride........here we go again w the check engine.  This time....thermostat.  Lordy, I'm broke now.  Hell I was broke before but now I'm really REALLY broke lol.
Marco made sure to bring me back to show me the reading on the machine reader for the code (appreciate ya).
It's been 5 1/2 days and so far we are looking good.  Jack even called yesterday to see how everything was going.  
NOW....Let's be clear.  The check engine light repeatedly coming on had nothing to do with the work that they had performed.  Each time it was something different.  I was confused, like why won't it just give ALL the codes at once but Jack and Marco patiently explained to me that it just doesn't work that way, especially for older cars.  I've trusted this place since I first met Hamid and now dealing with Marco and Jack for what was every other day, I trust them as well.
Fellas and the mechanic that worked hard on my car, I appreciate you!  Thank you for being patient with my frustrations and my confusion and thank you so much for working with me!
Hope to NOT see you anytime soon lol."
positive,"The service department is amazing.  They came out to greet me before I had even stopped my car.  This was in the middle of summer (July 2017) and it was not pleasant outside.  They collected the information they needed from the car extremely quickly (odometer reading, etc) and I was ushered inside in under two minutes.  

The 2015 subaru WRX I brought in for a repair was having an issue with the CVT (bad choice) transmission was slipping and having rough shifting.  It was an intermittent problem.  The service manager and I went on a test drive but the problem didn't occur this time.  He sent it back to the service department regardless.  They researched the problem and found a software update for the transmission.  It took a while because they had to let the transmission cool down first before they could apply the update.  This was not a problem because their waiting room is amazing.  I swear their kitchen is nicer than most people's homes and it's really a pleasant place to wait.  Giant 75 inch TV's and leather chairs made it easy to spend an hour while they performed the update.  

Subaru of America was terrific as well, as my car was technically out of warranty by nearly 2000 miles but they performed the update for free regardless!  I was very impressed.  The software update was successful.  So far I have not encountered the issue again, but it's only been a day since the update was applied.  

I can't speak for the sales department.

The service department is terrific.  10/10 across the board.  Keep up the good work."
positive,"Friendly neighborhood car repair. I've had my brakes serviced, oil changes, and transmission service. Sometimes there are deals on groupon for car services, and it doesn't hurt to call and ask them to honor the price without purchasing the groupon! I always get my car back in a timely manner, and I appreciate the rides home! Located just north of Cactus on cave creek road, on the east side of the street, across from Home Depot."
positive,"Had the Compustar R3 2-way installed on my manual transmission Impreza. I usually do my own mechanical maintenance but electrical stuff is a bit beyond my expertise. With that said, I wanted someone experienced installing remote engine start on my brand new car. Kyle knows the product like the back of his hand and performs a ""clean"" install using soldering of wires instead of crimping where it is a less reliable connection. I'm really glad I got this installed since I just moved to the area and getting used to my first midwest winter. Will be coming back in the summer for a tint install!"
positive,"Once again, amazing service! Lee and the guys are always so friendly and welcoming there and they take the time to explain what needs to be done. I went in for a smog check and see why my check engine light was on so i can get my registration renewed. They were able to diagnose, order and fix everything in less than 2 days while keeping me updated on the process. It also came out much less than I expected :) I will refer them to anyone! Thanks again Rebel!"
positive,"Yesterday I needed my car diagnosed for a IAC issue. When I initially called I was stressed out and not very nice but they listened and told me to come over. They brought my car right back and ran a few tests. I dealt with Bill, Lorenzo, and Mike. My car needs more tests because it's not throwing a code and the check engine light isn't going on. I'm usually very good at diagnosing my car and these guys did not dismiss me. I apologized for being rude and Lorenzo asked me if I was okay. I broke down into tears and I got a hug. It was certain a bad day! I'll be back on Monday. Lorenzo listened to me and gave me a sympathetic ear. Having car problems at this point in time is the least of my troubles buts nice to know that you have good, honest, mechanics that are there to help and actually care! They will always have my business! They will drive me home when I drop my car off as they have done on the past and will update me on the progress of the tests. The plan is to hook up a computer to my vehicle and drive it to catch the issue. If you need someone who will treat you right go see these guys. I know they are like this at every location as I have had to have my tires checked at a few others. I'm in outbound sales and drive a lot. Trustworthy and transparent are the 2 most important words I can think of with this company."
positive,"My car is a 1955 Buick Special, the transmission was leaking badly that I couldn't be able to drive my car for months. The gaskets were 60 years old as worn out. The transmission works fine even with heavy leaking. I took my car to Buster, and he was very honest and reasonable price to have it fixed. Buster double check inside of transmission to ensure if it needs to be rebuild. He says it is in very good condition as don't need to rebuild. He put new gaskets to stop the leakage. I m amazed at his skills and get things done in time. I would recommend him to any classic or modern cars to be repair. He is the man!"
positive,"Let start off by saying I live at Scottsdale and Shea and drive to 32nd Street and Greenway to go to Community Tire Pros.  Ron and Mike are fantastic!.  There isn't a more honest group of guys around!  

The car's transmission was slipping so we took it in to them to take a look at it.  They did and the total come to $8,500 to fix it.  Now for the good part, Ron did some additional research on the problem.  He had scoured the internet and also called friend who worked for Volvo in town to confirm what he learned.  It was a known issue for Volvo's and the manufacturer might give us some relief on it.  

We picked up the car and took it to Volvo to get it looked at.  They came back with the same problem as Community Tire.  Same price as well.  But the service rep offered to go to Volvo to get me some help to pay for it.  Volvo offered to pay for half.  Prior to the car getting fixed I went over all the repairs Volvo said needed fixed with Ron at Community Tire to verify them and Volvo fixed the car.  Now we are back on the road.  

I just want to point out the they did the best for me, not them.  Not only was I advised on how to get a better deal, Ron also took additional time with me to make sure the fix was right.  They didn't get paid for any of this.  They did the right thing for me.  

I can't say more than this - they will continue to be my auto repair of choice and I will refer all my friends there."
positive,"James Rocks!!! had a problem with emissions, went into here as the are right by me. James told me to come in the next day and we slapped some cats on no problem. I passed emissions no problem. Prices are good, workmanship is great. This is not a huge shop, they can be busy at times, but their work is great. I've found my new muffler shop."
positive,"First time at MB Motors based upon Yelpers' recommendations.  Normally, I would go to the dealership and then cry on the way home after seeing the bill.  Gave these people a chance when my Mercedes had a noise and then showed the check engine light.  I am a cautious person so I was not driving the car with that light on without having a mechanic check it out.  Spoke to Jamie who assured me I could drive it in because it might be spark plugs or something to do with emissions.  As soon as I drove in, Bud, the mechanic/owner identified the noise as having to do with the power steering. Good hearing, experience, or both?  The problem was identified and after I picked up the next day, my car was driving beautiful with no noise and no ""check engine"" light.   I always wish my car repair bill was lower but considering that they also did some brake maintenance work as well,  I think the price would have been significantly higher at the Dealership.  
It was also a nice place to be people-wise.  Jamie, was very nice AND professional.  She also did me a big favor of driving me to a place to eat considering that the pickings are slim in their ""iffy""neighborhood.  Super cool young lady.  Thanks. Jamie."
positive,"I use their specialty (Exhaust) many times over the years.  
They were in a small complex at Dorval St, near Speedy Glass.

Later, they move to this new address and I have been there one time.  
Still, their service is very very good and reasonable too.  Very courteous, just good honest people with good management.
 
It is definitely my top go to place for mufflers.  Wish there are many more of these places these days."
positive,Great place to get your car repaired. They are very trustworthy and very thorough. Tj the owner is a great guy and will take the time to explain things to you. There are a few things I would caution people about but it's nothing too serious. They have longer then most wait times but once again they are very thorough and they will offer you a free ride home. They are not for early risers. Their doors open up between the hours of 0830 and 0945 and it could be later. Also when booking an appointment be advised that it will likely be a week out. Those are just somethings to know but overall it's a great place and I still encourage people to give em a go.
positive,"I was a referral from Decatur Mercedes-Benz auto repair so,I had these guys investigate why my 95 Tahoe work truck was dogging out so bad and I had a hunch it had to do with the exhaust,the owner thought that maybe my catalytic converter might be clogged or the muffler baffles were broken, especially since I have a quarter million miles on the truck. Anyway I just had him replace the catalytic converter and muffler and Its perfect.  The problem ended up being the baffles in the muffler were broken out and causing low flow. Anyway I have no complaints and I don't think these guys racially profile so don't worry about that review.
I also run a automotive type business and it's really nice to run across a company that's competent to do the work and confident at the same time. You guys at Performance rock, thank you, Mike"
positive,I can't believe what a true pleasure it was to actually get me car repaired. I was given a time slot that worked best with my schedule and was in and out in a shorter than anticipated time. My car was maintained in a professional manner and all service people were so friendly. This is my 2nd Maxima and their service is a main reason I'm a repeat customer.
positive,"I have a Late model Chevy Tahoe, I needed a custom Dual Exhaust  which I was quoted as much as $550 from other shops... I have paid upwards of $400 on other custom exhausts for my previous vehicles. (not done at Allstar)

I received this custom dual exhaust from the catalytic converter back for only $200!!!! ( I had my own flowmaster muffler I purchased from Summit Racing) The welds are clean, hangers fitted in the ""right"" places, 2 yr warranty (since its custom), good communication and customer service. Best Quality Best Price Hands down!

Only downside is they left a door open while they did the exhaust which killed my battery, they were quick to give me a jump and it charged back up with no problems...Hey no ones perfect, and I understand that Sh** happens!! no harm no folly!!"
positive,"I'm always nervous to go to mechanics because you always think the mechanics are going to lie to you just to take all your money. But I've been going to this blue diamond location the 2 years I've lived in Vegas because they are honest, hard working, friendly mechanics here that are willing to explain and show you whenever your car is in trouble. The first time I went here was for a simple break replacement.. I usually go shopping while I wait for my car (which is another plus about this location) so as I was browsing Ross one of the employees (I believe he was manager at the time) called me and told me while they were rotating my routers they noticed heat spots or something that was not good.. I kind of panicked and asked if I could see because I was scared of getting ripped off. So they told me to come back so they could show me before they replaced it for me.. In the end they were so helpful and nice that day I kept going back. I get my oil changed regularly here and they help me to upkeep my car for perfect running conditions.. Even when they told me my transmission fluid should be changed I wasn't sure but they were happy to dip a test strip in the transmission fluid and show me it should be changed. Also Jim the manager is so nice and understanding. I always feel like I understand more about my car everytime I visit. Thank you guys for being amazing at what you do!"
positive,"It's hard to be impressed when you go in to a place for a simple oil change but the employees at Econo Lube in Green Valley thoroughly impressed me. I took my Nissan in for a basic oil change before my road trip. I normally go to Jiffy Lube and because I have an SUV I end up paying around $50 when I walk out but at Econo Lube I paid about $30 and got the best service I've ever had. They topped everything off, looked at by brakes, rotated my tires and did a diagnostic check of a check engine light that kept popping up. I also appreciated the fact that they did not try to ""up sell"" the oil change, they kept it sweet and simple and because ""I'm just a girl"" they didn't try and tell me I needed to overhaul my engine ;-). I dealt with John who is the manager and he was super nice and helpful. The only negative thing I can say is that their lobby is TINY but then again aren't all oil service places??

Side note: When I was there a former employee went to have his car serviced simultaneously and the general consensus was this was the best place in town to have your car serviced for minor things."
positive,"I gave this place 5 stars because I can't give it 10! I first found out about this place about 13 years ago when I met Paul the manager at my place of employment.  Shortly after I had a problem with a vehicle, I knew it was going to be expensive but I didn't know who to trust.  I told Paul about the problem and he said that him and his staff could help.  My first thought was ""don't these guys just do brakes, I need transmission work?""  Ultimately my transmission was fixed in a timely manner, fixed properly and at a fair price.  

Since that time I have taken 4 of my other personal vehicles there. I have 4 co-workers who ONLY take their vehicles here. My current vehicle is a Toyota with FREE 24 month/2 year maintenance and an I still went here and PAID! I've taken my girlfriends car here and she's referred 2 of her friends.  All of these people feel they were treated properly and given a fair price.  All of them plan to return if/when they have any vehicle service needs.  I take great pride in being able to send customers and friends to an honest and fair garage. 

Paul gives you an honest assessment of what you need and tells you what can wait if your financially strapped and tells you what needs to be fixed right away.  I have stood and watched El work on my car and he's amazing! I don't even mind staying while my car is being worked on. I have even stayed and ate lunch with them twice. This place ROCKS!"
positive,"Great crew here at performance mufflers shop. They took their time to make sure it was done right. Very reasonable price. Joe was great , he was able to get me in without appointment. Definitely coming back for future customization/ repair needs."
positive,"The manager at this location, Roc, was very friendly. He took the time to explain not only what needed to be done but also functionalities of the parts that needed to be serviced. The check engine light was on and before spending thousands of dollars to get the problem fixed at their shop, they did have us check the warranty on the car first. The service was quick and honest. They looked for problems that wouldn't be the most expensive, where as most places would have just ripped me off. Roc and his team did not do this. They took our concerns very seriously and kept us updated on our vehicle. When one thing didn't work they kept moving along until the problem was found, agaim starting at what would cost the least to fix and working up. I appreciated that all the work done was in the same day and that even as more costumers came in our car wasn't put aside. 
In my visit, I saw that they were very accommodating to the needs of their costumers. Roc was very forward about costs and time of services. 
We will continue to use this location and business for all of our auto needs. I would recommend this place to my family and friends."
positive,"First time doing business with All Pro. Offered free towing to pick our car up from our home. Were very thorough in making sure it was not a transmission problem and even towed our car for free to Brake Masters so we could find the problem (which we did). They made sure to make the process as easy as possible. Very nice guy, and  although we didn't end up having any actual work done on our vehicle, the diagnostic price was more than fair. He went above and beyond to accommodate our hectic schedule."
positive,"We were traveling from Henderson, NV to southern Arizona when our check engine light came on. We were close to Casa Grande, so we took our Cadillac SUV to Auto Zone to have the code read. We found out the problem and promptly went to GMC since there wasn't a Cadillac dealer there. We explained to them that we were traveling with our 94 year-old grandfather when they told us they couldn't fit us in that day. Once they heard that, they did everything they could to try and accommodate us. They were, unfortunately, able to fit us in, but they found the repair was still covered under our power train warranty. I called Cadillac in Tucson. They were going to be closing soon (this was about 3:00pm), and said they couldn't do it that day. Since the nice service guys at GMC told us we were still warrantied, I asked Cadillac if we could get s loaner until we came back through Tucson in a couple of days. Once I asked him that, he decided to hold a service guy late so they could perform the repairs as soon as we got there! Had we not found out we were under warranty, repairs would not have happened that day!! We are very thankful!!"
positive,Needed some mufflers installed on my mustang.  They got me in and out in an hour for a great price.  Place is not much to look at but they know their stuff and I'm happy.
positive,This is the second time I have taken my trucks to busters Transmission Service and once again they did miracles long story short this is a 2001 Chevy 1500 Z 71 which the transmission decided to grenade itself it was so bad that it basically threw all of the gears except first so I decided once again I will send my truck to Dan at busters transmission well he made it happen. He not only completely rebuilt my transmission he made it better I am extremely pleased and also they didn't just fix my transmission they fix the brakes on the truck as well they locked up and broke and they replaced everything and fixed it for me again if you need a good transmission service and all-around great mechanics you need to bring your truck or car to them they will take care of you and will help you out anyway that they possibly can thank you guys at busters Transmission Service again for a great job
positive,"Perfect location on the right side of South Blvd. for my daily commute. Now you can order online, pay with PayPal and pick up in the store for a swift transaction. In addition, they seem to always have coupons and deals for 15-20% off for online orders. I highly recommend going this route.

The store is well stocked with the basics for auto repair in your own driveway. Tools including socket sets, spark plugs, new batteries, aftermarket air intakes, muffler tips. Accessories including license plate borders, sticker letters/numbers if you want to make your Camry a 4x4 or make your F150 a Camry, seat and steering wheel covers, novelty valve stem caps, etc.

Staff is friendly and helpful. You can get your battery checked and of course replaced if necessary. It doesn't seem to me that they rig their machine to give a bad reading in their favor. They'll also help you install your newly purchased windshield wipers. Good shop for all those general auto-owner needs!"
positive,"I couldn't find #1 Transmission here on Yelp but felt it was important to add it! If you look at the Google reviews you will find them at 4.9 star rating with lots of great reviews. 
My transmission went out on my 2007 Camry and with money being quite a huge issue as I'm on a fixed income (but aren't we all!) I had several options to choose from, and with a brand new transmission being quoted at $4229 on a 10+ year old car I didn't think that was the way for me to go. I got quotes from several places to rebuild, & to drop in a used tranny w/60,000 miles.. prices ranged but Mario gave me a good price w/warranty of 12mos/12,000 miles. Which was also the going ""rate"" from other places however Mario was much more helpful than the other places, he also allowed someone to call in credit card info to pay for it where other places would not do! Which was my saving grace! 

My car was done for a good price, service was above others, and car was done when they said it would be done! I'll be bringing my car here for all future repairs as they aren't just a transmission repair they do
All automotive repairs/service and for a fair price!! Mario quoted me some other things that I need to have done & it was over $50 cheaper than Purrfect Auto- which has terrible reviews and it's also where I pulled my car from originally! Their quoted price for tranny repair went up $100 every time I spoke to them! 
So THANK YOU MARIO you were wonderful & very patient with me!"
positive,"I had my 1971 Ford F250 brought in on crutches. It wouldn't start and transmission seemed to act funny prior to that. Made an appointment with Brad. Jeff who did the work was very busy but he did get to it. After the initial troubleshooting with compression tests it was brought to my attention that two cylinders were misfiring badly. The diagnosis was it might need a engine overhaul or new one with estimate north of $1500. I was very nervous and Brad must have felt this because the next call was the following day. After looking underneath the valve covers, Jeff found one bent push rod, carburetor fuel /air was out of adjustment, bad fuel pump, bad main gas tank (auxilllary OK) which explained the odd behavior of the transmission. Jeff fixed all the problems except the gas tank. It is filled with crap and I will probably have it replaced. I stress your mechanics are just people too, especially when they've been dealing with a problem child before yours. Give them some room to figure it out and you will be glad you did. I gladly, paid $460 cash for a great job. My truck passed emissions that weekend and it even runs better than it did before it stopped. The shop is kind of hidden next to another shop and needs a bigger building or sign. Thank you guys!"
positive,We went to Joes by chance. We were actually on our way to another shop when our check engine light started flashing so we immediately pulled into the closest place which was Joes. The guy who helped us was really nice and they took care of the issue. Not sure how their prices compare since we didn't really have an option to shop around but it didn't seem too bad for everything they had to do to get the truck running. Would definitely go back.
positive,"These guys are great! 

When the owner of this business left his previous location to work for himself (was working at one of the big chains previously), I happily started getting my oil changed here... And more!!

I own old vehicles. Kris is an honest guy and he actually told me to stop spending money on one of my vehicles! He knew that the new replacement truck I got would mean I'd only need him for oil changes instead of coming through every few months to fix the next thing that died on my old truck. Now that's an honest auto guy. 

I have always found them friendly and helpful, but their knowledge, expertise, honesty, and great work ethic is what really keeps me coming back and referring my friends. 

I can't believe that I had never left them a review and that no one else had (other than 1 person who apparently found them on their lunch break?)

From oil changes to transmission repair, you will not regret checking these guys out! Really!

Can you tell I'm impressed!?"
positive,"I read the reviews on here and decided that it was time to give Ron's a shot.  I stopped in on Veteran's Day to get my oil changed. Met Jasen was very impressed by his professional attitude.  After my oil change was complete, Jasen took me out to my car and explained that it might be time to do the transmission fluid change.  I agreed to the $150 service and waited for it to be done.  I paid a total of around $180 and went home satisfied.  I noticed a drop of oil in my driveway when I got home but thought it was just residual oil from the service.  Friday evening, I notice that my car has left a puddle of oil\fluid in my garage.  I immediately went inside, scheduled an appointment online for Saturday morning and intended on going in at 8.  Jasen got my appointment request and called me Friday night to confirm the issue and have me bring it in.  Saturday morning I arrive at 8 and am greeted by staff who take my car right back.  Moments later, I meet Ron (Owner) who was very friendly and explained what happened - the tech accidently overfilled my transmission fluid and it was leaking.  Ron and his tech installed the proper amount of transmission fluid, power washed the bottom of my car and provided me with a coupon for a free car wash.  The big surprise was when Ron handed me a check for the original $180 I had paid - I was shocked.  Ron even offered to come to my house and power wash my driveway because of the mistake.  Couldn't help but to be impressed by the service I received and though a mistake was made, the staff went above and beyond to make it right.  I have every intention of taking my vehicle back to Ron's and suggesting them to friends\family.  I fully expected to have to haggle them on the repair but that never happened - Ron stated that ""This isn't the way we do business"" and I certainly believe it.  Thanks Ron, Jasen and staff for making it right and earning a customer for life."
positive,"MUNICH MOTORS is the best. Top quality work, Good prices and ZERO BS!  They have done work on my e30 and e36 m3. These guys know what they are doing, they have saved me time and money because of their expert level of knowledge. If you're buying a used bmw take it to them for a pre purchase inspection...for a small fee they take just about all of the risk out of buying privately owned BMW and MERCEDES BENZS. Plus they have a pre owned lot of really clean cars. Now they are working on a 5 speed manual transmission swap for me and I have no doubt that it is gonna be perfect. I'll update when I get the car back,  I wouldn't even attempt a job like this with any other shops. But MUNICH MOTORS has my full trust and respect. And I don't trust anyone without out them earning it. I've been a German car enthusiast for over 15 years. I've worked in the industry as Starmark lot manager, and a gopher for several MB, BMW DEALERSHIPS. I'm thoroughly impressed and will continue to give them top notch reviews because they have earned that respect. Give them a chance and I can damn near guarantee you will be satisfied and then some. BEST BMW/BENZ SHOP IN PHOENIX."
positive,"My check engine light was on, so I brought it in to see what was going on. Turns out, since my car is from CA, it was on because it would have failed the smog test. Since Arizona has no smog test, which they told me, I didn't need to get it fixed. It would have required replacing the parts responsible for the smog test, about $750 each, but since I'm not going to California, they said I didn't have to do the repair if I didn't want to. They only billed me for the labor costs, and that was very cheap at just $50. I highly recommend you go to this place for repairs or even to just see what's up with your car."
positive,"I have so many good things to say about my experiences here I don't know where to begin.  I bought my Sportwagen TDI from Camelback VW because that dealership was affiliated with Costco.  I got a good price, but the experience was unpleasant and my first service experience there was catastrophically bad, causing me to seek out another dealership.  

To date, VW North Scottsdale has performed the 10k, 20k, 30k, 40k, and DSG service on my car, as well as some warranty work.  Each experience has been phenomenal.  Tom Radtke is my service rep, and he is AWESOME.  There's no other way to say it.  He is super pleasant to speak with, has great follow through and communication, and actually listens to what I tell him about my car.  You will never be disappointed with Tom.

To give a little context to my review:  I had an Audi and a Mercedes before my VW, and the level of service offered by Tom and VW North Scottsdale eclipses that of the nearby Audi and Mercedes dealerships.  I consider myself car enthusiast and I historically do most of the work on my cars myself (timing belt changes, control arm replacements, brake jobs, transmission services, etc.).  I know my way around a car and I know when something is not working correctly.  

The typical experience when you present a car problem to a dealer or independent is dismissal, unless it is something completely obvious, like a front end collision.  If it is a complaint that the service provider is not familiar with, you are dismissed as paranoid or irrational.  For example, I had an issue with my car shortly after purchase and had it towed to Camelback VW.  I was subsequently treated with condescension and mockery, and charged nearly $300 to fix the problem.  Recently, Tom and his crew diagnosed this very same problem as a warranty issue and fixed it, at no cost to me.  It was a completely different experience.

I initially brought my car to the VW dealership because the first three services are free.  I continue to take my car to Tom at VW North Scottsdale and pay for it because they do such a fantastic job.  VW North Scottsdale presents such good value and makes the service experience so pleasant I would now prefer to pay them to service my car rather than do the work myself.

Tom has always been my contact at VW North Scottsdale and I cannot say enough good things about him, but I also want to say his crew who does the actual work on the car is awesome too.  Collectively, they make a great team."
positive,"Amazing!!! This muffler shop is very good. They are clean, friendly and professional. I had some custom piping done and added a resonator to a bolt on exhaust that was just too loud.  When they were done it looked like I bought it that way. I found this place because a neighbor recommended them to me. Now I am recommending them to all. They get very busy though so I recommend calling for an appointment."
positive,"We hit a hunk of metal something-or-other on an Interstate exit ramp that left the car sounding like the muffler had been punctured. The fellow at this Meineke location squeezed us in without an appointment, called soon after to report a couple of broken clamps, and for about $170, we were on our way again. Our fears of them ""sticking it"" to a couple of out-of-owners were completely unfounded. If they do such good work this fairly for strangers, I would have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone lucky enough to live in their neighborhood."
positive,"We've been to Buddys twice now. Once for an engine replacement. We called several places, and we got quotes for double what Buddys quoted us. We did get a used engine but we discussed this in length with Jason and decided it was the best option for us. The car ran great for months until the check engine light went off. We took it in again, and found out it was the temp gauge (which we had suspected). The price was reasonable and they turned around the fix within hours. We even took the car to Vegas after and it drove smoothly. Very happy so far with Jason and Buddys!"
positive,"Cliff and Craig took very good care of me and my 2008 Honda Civic and made a long-time customer out of me.

After having my oil changed at a shop down the street that quoted me in excess of $400 for a myriad of recommended repairs, I asked Brake Masters for a second opinion. 

First and foremost, the customer service was phenomenal. The wait wasn't long to inspect and clean my brakes, flush the transmission fluid, and replace my air filters. The team communicated often concerning their findings and the cost was much less than the first shop. They saved me a brake job, power steering flush, money, and more importantly, time. I felt as though they valued my patronage and sought to provide the best service possible -- an invaluable yield for any service provider."
positive,"These guys were honest!  

I had issues with the 2nd gear grinding, so I took it to Crawford Transmission.  I was expecting a bill of around $2,000.  That seems to be the average for transmission replacement and repair.  They guy from Crawford's took it for a test drive, and then showed me a part that had simply come loose.  He re-fastened it for Free!

It's hard to find such honest people in the car repair business."
positive,"As most VW/Audi drivers know, these are awesome cars until a check engine light comes on.  Having only driven VW/Audi's my whole life I'm used to this and accept it because when they are running great they are fantastic cars to drive.  You also learn very early that it takes a special mechanic with the skills and knowledge to accurately work on these vehicles.  Well, look no further because this shop can fix anything.

About a year ago I let a friend who hadn't driven stick in a while drive my car home from the bar and it was a HUGE MISTAKE.  He somehow managed to stall the car extremely violently, but the car restarted and it wasn't until the next day that I saw the dreaded CEL.  I noticed a considerable loss of power and torque and was scared something catastrophic had happened to the engine.  I took it to a shop in Cleveland where I had just got transferred to for work and the guy said he loved to work on audi's and that it shouldn't be a problem.  Well, almost $2,000 dollars later the car was still not running right.  I was so frustrated that I just dealt with it until I was transferred back to Pittsburgh and couldn't take it anymore.

I read the reviews for this shop and decided I'd give it a shot.  Immediately after walking in you know this shop specializes in VW/Audi, which was a relief for me.  They say if you can fix those cars you can probably fix anything.  I talked to Greg when I dropped my car off and felt a lot better about the situation knowing these guys could handle it.  Greg was able to diagnose the problem that the other guy couldn't and make a great suggestion to save me more money down the road.  Well, I picked my car up last night and couldn't believe my eyes when the check engine light was off and the car drove amazing on the way home, it felt like a brand new car.  I'm so thankful that they finally fixed it and really took the time to explain (Greg and Rock) and answer any questions even though they are super busy.

As long as I'm in the area they have a customer for life.  Hopefully, my car isn't going back anytime soon though."
positive,"I had my Lexus only 1 week when I was hit in the side by a truck in a parking lot.  Needless to say, I was very skeptical as to how it would look after it was repaired, especially matching the paint.  I was reassured by Caliber that it would look as good as new.  We were updated by text at every step.  And, when we picked it up, we were pleasantly surprised, because it did look as good as new.  Even my husband, who used to paint vehicles, said they did a great job matching the paint.  Hopefully, I won't need their services again, but if I ever need a car repaired, I will definitely use Caliber Collision on WT Harris Blvd."
positive,"Amazing customer service in the service department! Drove from Cali at 4am and check engine light came on at 7am. They took my car in without appt at 9am and got it back the same day. Since I'm from out of state and had no appt, I had been denied any service at other Chevy dealer in Vegas. Henderson Chevy was nothing but helpful and quick. Andy, you are awesome! Thank you Henderson Chevy for making my business to Nevada successful and as stress free as possible. :)"
positive,"Have purchased two vehicles through AutoNation Scion Tempe, and have always been treated great by Eddie and his great team down there. Scheduling appointments is extremely easy, and any issues that have arisen with my vehicle under warranty were always honored. In fact, when the throwout bearing (under powertrain warranty) went out on my car and resulted in significant smoke/burn damage to my clutch (manual transmission), AutoNation ensured that I would have a new clutch replaced on my vehicle as well. This was a class act on their part, and I respect the service reps at this location along with the management. 

Will always use AutoNation, and I have had no significant issues with any appointments at this dealership. Would recommend to a friend, as I believe they are very trustworthy."
positive,"Had my car towed to Bell Lexus after the engine caught on fire.

When I took it home, the check engine light came back on.

They gave me a loaner car for $10.00 and discovered the VVT valve was bad NOT related to the fire.

Replace the Oil Control Valve and sent me on my way.

Would NEVER go anywhere else for service on my Lex, these guys rock!"
positive,"My dreaded check engine light was on and I was told at auto zone that it could be a number of issues. I was referred by a friend to check out Mello Motives, Tim and his crew were able to get my vehicle in assess the problem. They could have really taken me to the cleaner but I was in and out with a new temperature check gauge and my car is running beautifully again! To say that I'm highly satisfied is an understatement, don't hesitate to trust this team for your next car needs."
positive,Just want to say a big thank you to everybody at ultimate collision.. Dennis was amazing and helped me tremendously the work was flawless and I could not be more happy with my car! and the work that they did made it look just like the day I bought it which is only two months ago! They take pride in their customer service and their work if you're going to go get your car repaired anywhere please go here and contact Dennis! Five stars from me and I will refer everybody to this establishment!
positive,"I decided to go here bc of the great yelp reviews. found out for myself they are excellent. Very nice and professional. they replaced my needed part and my check engine light came on again right after (frustrating, but it happens), so I was able to bring it right back and they replaced a couple hoses to that part and it took care of the problem. it is working great now. highly recommend."
positive,"These guys were fast, friendly, and efficient. Brandon topped off the washer fluid, balanced the tire pressure, and checked the transmission fluid, coolant, and battery, all before the oil change was complete. As I was being rung up, I got an apology for them being ""backed up"". I waited maybe 15 minutes, and the oil change only took 15 minutes! Not only is this team faster than Terrible Herbst, they're less expensive, much friendlier, and work with a sense of urgency. I got there around 8:30 AM, so my assumption is, the earlier you get there the better, because by the time I left they had 2 lines each 3 cars deep. Again, big thanks to this team on restoring my faith; I've had nothing but bad experiences w/service stations AND dealerships, but these guys were great."
positive,"I have been taking all of my vehicles to Desert Car Care for a couple of years now and have always been pleased with the results.  They have performed fluid changes, brakes, transmission services, and other repairs.  They are prompt and I have never had any charges that were not reasonable.  I recommend them to anyone that needs auto repair and maintenance."
positive,"The staff there are friendly. The damage was minor but it took two weeks to get the car repaired because every time we were told it was ""ready"" it wasn't.  We had color matching issues. Our claims rep, Erin, was great though!"
positive,"Rolf and Chris of framers workshop provide a transcendental service:   They
transform and elevate art into finished and focused pieces to be treasured as a legacy.   The
technique, expertise, and discernment exhibited by their matting and framework
Never ceases to astonish the eye.   I just
Had a complex pastel on paper framed
With extraordinary results.   Rolf even
Framed a painted car muffler for me on
Oak plinth with plexiglass a few years ago.   If you would like to experience
the pinnacle of the art of framing, come
to Framer's Workshop!"
positive,"I took my son there to have a performance muffler to put on his car. Jonny and Scott were the 2 guys that helped us out and they were really knowledgeable about what they do and very informative. 

They offered some suggestions as to which muffler is the best fit for what my son wants for look and sound.

They wasted no time ordering the muffler and within 2 hours my son had exactly what he wanted on his car. I highly recommend this place and either of these guys to do the work.

Its kind of funny because Jonny sounds exactly like the character Seth from the movie Superbad! Just a little side note but back on track I go...Check them out if you need a muffler, they will do a great job!"
positive,"In reading the previous reviews, people either seem to love this place or hate it -- put me in the first group. My car  -- suddenly and without notice -- started sounding like a 1970's hooptie Datsun with a bad muffler. I took it in, they put it off on the lift, and showed me how the pipe holding the muffler to the catalytic converter was corroded and probably just jarred loose while going over a bump. They dropped me off at Chinook Center to kill time (only about an hour and a half) and boom -- it was done, and for about $300 (which is exactly what I expected.) No up-selling, no replacing anything which didn't need replacing. Straight-up guys; respectful, and great at what they do."
positive,"I was very impressed by the professionalism and expertise of the whole team at AAMCO Transmissions.  Not only they treat their customers very well but they are highly skilled.

I went to see AAMCO Transmissions after visiting three other car mechanics about one problem with my car; a loud vibrating noise starting at speeds above 50mph.  The results from the visits at other automotive shops ranged from offering to charge me for standard safety checks that may or may not be related to the actual problem, to actually proceeding to unnecessary part replacement, to complete misdiagnosis of the problem at the transmission level.  In sharp contrast, AAMCO offered to diagnose the car for free, including the transmission, found the actual problem - a part under the hood was slightly loose and would start flapping when too much air would get under - and fixed it for free.  When this was done, one of the franchise owners - Brian - drove the car with me to make sure the problem was solved.

In addition to fixing your problems, these guys are also very friendly and professional.  I only wish all car mechanics would have this type of work ethics."
positive,"This is the best mechanic experience I have had in years. Tim is honest, knowledgable and plesant to work with. I had dialed Mr. Mechanic thinking I was calling another muffler shop. Awesome mistake! I drove 23 miles at the last minute for him to put on a catalytic converter and  a thermostat. 2 hours later it was done and the price was 50% lower than a quote I had. I was ready to donate my vehicle until then.  I will be going back for him to fix my cvs axle and boot. I would give this mechanic 10 stars."
positive,"My husband,and i helped a little bit, used the self service at u fix it. i can say that we are extremly happy with how it turned out. shop was clean, organized and customercare was outstanding.
I know we saved about 300$ by bleeding the breakes and changing the transmission fluid ourself.instead of 80-120$ an hour we payed 20$ for the lift and 10$ for specialty tools...this includes good adwise from realy good tecs.
So if you know what you do and dont have a problem to get dirty yourself this is the place to be."
positive,"Highly recommend. I have taken my Jeep in for: oil changes, spark plug replacement, coolant and transmission flushes/exchanges. John Jay has been straightforward, honest, and prices his services very reasonably. John Jay has earned the right to be my new mechanic and I trust anyone who takes their vehicle to his shop will be equally satisfied."
positive,"I just took my Z4 to these guys after getting ripped off at the dealer over and over.  I can't believe how much cheaper the prices were than my previous repairs were from the BMW dealer.  Bryan was the mechanic and he fixed my check engine light.  As a woman you have to be very careful when going to some random mechanic.  Suzette was amazing, she explained to me the whole process and the prices were very fair.  i would recommend this shop to anyone who has a BMW or MINI!!!"
positive,"My 2003 F150 could not have gotten better care! I took my truck to Rebel Automotive on the recommendation of a friend. Another shop had diagnosed my truck as in need of ball joints but balked when I gave them my extended warrantee information so I decided to get another opinion. Lee at Rebel took my short list of complaints , some noise and vibration issues, and went with me for a test drive asking me to indicate the sounds and vibrations as I noticed them. Not some around the block test drive , we drove about 10 miles before Lee was fully satisfied. I left Lee my warrantee information and my truck. Four hours later Lee called me to let me know that he had rotated my tires and rebalanced one of the rears and the vibration was gone. He went on to tell me that I needed to replace my transmission mount ( one of my complaints ) and both engine mounts were badly rotted. Lee had already called and gotten approval for the repairs and we set up a time for me to return for the repairs. Incidentally, Lee assured me that there was nothing wrong with my ball joints. 

After setting up a tentative date to perform the repairs, lee and I discussed an air conditioning problem I was having. Lee promised to check that for me when next my truck was in. 

When the chassis issues were rectified, ( in a very prompt ) fashion, Lee called me with a time estimate for the A/C repairs, he also told me that he had received authorization from my warrantee to proceed with that repair as well. I was thrilled and authorized the repairs. 

I left Rebel automotive a very happy customer having had all my issues resolved, a fraudulent claim avoided and only having to make two trips and pay two $50 deductibles and a very reasonable fee for the tire work and an oil change. I figure if this keeps up I'll keep my truck another 10 years with Lee and Rebel Automotive's help. Five Stars!"
positive,"These guys were extremely accommodating. We were towing through town when we started having some problems with our truck. Mike answered my call and made my vehicle his priority. Unfortunately the problem wasn't an easy fix and I ultimately needed a new transmission. Within an hour of leaving Sun, I was having my truck towed to the dealership. This was hard to stomach after spending over $700 at Sun Auto.  When I asked at the dealership, the employees there stated that Sun Auto is extremely reputable. Based on their customer service I would return."
positive,"5 STARS PLUS!!! Munich Motors is a top level, masterful mechanic shop. They have just completed an automatic to manual transmission swap on my e36 m3. If you don't already know, this is a major project to take on. This is not the kind of thing that  just any shop will, or CAN do. The finished project is flawless, not to say that there wasn't any hiccups during the process but,  the extremely diligent manner in which they handled the issues was just more reassurance of how capable and honest they are. The whole project took a little more than 4 weeks, it was drivable after 3 weeks, there  was just a few small ""buttoning up"" type of return trips to Munich Motors. To be clear that was part of the plan from the beginning so there were almost no suprises. Grant kept in touch with me regularly because he knew that this project was a big deal to me , so he gave me updates several times a week or whenever a major part of the project was completed then informed me as to what was next. I greatly appreciated that courtesy especially because they are a busy garage yet still gave me a lot of personal attention, taking the time to explain all the technical processes in a way that a non-mechanic could understand. Although this was an expensive undertaking it wasn't because  of Munich Motors . 
The Boss, Grant,  actually made  sure that he and his master tech, Graham, did everything they could to keep costs down. Mostly by being extremely generous with the man hours. The cost for parts was also low. On a lot of the parts they made no profit and I simply paid what it cost them. They also did a lug stud conversion, spacers, and got me new tires for less then I would have paid anywhere else.  Bottom line, they took excellent care of me and my car. Grant even gifted me an $80 shift knob, which I would have bought anyway but that's how much they value their customers.  Mechanics of this caliber are rare. I will literally NEVER take my M3 anywhere else. DON'T HESITATE TO TAKE YOUR BMW OR MERCEDES BENZ TO MUNICH MOTORS THEY WILL DO THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE. other shops MAY be able to do what Munich Motors does but I wouldn't even consider it personally. If you want your  German car taken care of properly just go to MUNICH MOTORS. you will not be disappointed."
positive,"Don't let the fact that it is a part of a 'chain' put you off. They are as close to a neighbor business as it gets. The manager Todd, seemed to know (many by name) more than half the customers that came in while I was waiting, and you could tell they were happy customers, coming back for regular service.

I have been here in the past for an alignment and was pleased and went back for a few  30,000 mile service items that I do not do myself (I am old school and still do my own oil/rotate tires/wipers, etc). They were among the cheapest of the non dealers I called after you check for coupons on the web. AND, they ended up being slightly less than they quoted me on the phone as the Trans flush required slightly less fluid than standard. 

Service was even done slightly ahead of schedule! (PS - Several eating establishments in the same parking lot if you decide to wait)"
positive,"I recently had a tensioner replaced on my Audi A5, the car was in and out within an hour and the parts and labor were reasonably priced. This is the second service I had on this car, my previous service was a transmission flush and SS brake line install each time the service has been timely and of high quality. 

In addition to the service they performed, they have also loaded an APR stage 2+ file on the A5. Unless there is a absolute need to take my car to an Audi dealership, AZ Euros will be my first stop to service the three Audi's in my stable."
positive,"I called a lot of different places cause my transmission needed some maintenance! All quoted me $2,500 to $3,500! I called this place they did less then $2,000. Plus fix my oil leak! And was still less then $2,000. Very helpful friendly and won't rip u off! Recommend this place to any one!"
positive,Geico referred me to Caliber as a preferred repair shop. The attention to detail and consistent communication keeping me posted about repair status was exemplary. Brought car home and noted the auto lock on drivers door with FOB in my pocket no longer worked. Called and spoke with the manager and we arranged to have it looked at this morning. Less than 30 minutes later the door works fine and they even installed a new headlamp housing I had purchased on my own. Bottom line is that the customer service and expert technical service have been wonderful through the stressful process of having my car repaired back to the rythym of my life. Thanks you guys.
positive,Amazing service!! The flange from my exhaust was missing and Nissan wanted to charge me $280 plus labor for a REPLACEMENT muffler! The team here took me in quickly and fixed my car within 30 mins for a fraction of what I might've paid. My brother is in the automotive industry and he and a few of my friends recommended JPG Exhaust- SO happy I came here!
positive,"I am so thrilled with my new exhaust setup installed this afternoon.  Joe really knows his stuff and they are an extremely busy muffler shop.  Clean, honest and dependable mechanics very capable of doing custom muffler work to your everyday solutions to pass smog.

I originally came to see them because I used them about 10 years ago when I had another modified vehicle that I did custom work on.  They were professional then and I knew in the back of my mind I was going to see if they were still in business.  Luckily they were and Joe suggested I buy the pre packaged Bassani X Pipe online and they would install it for only $140!  Extremely reasonable, especially for the simple fact I don't have a lift in my garage.  I dropped it off at 8AM this morning and it was done just after 1PM.  When I came to pick up my stang I knew immediately they got the right look I was looking for.  He also hooked me up with two chrome tips for only $100!

Extremely reasonable shop and nice employees.  They're very busy, so be patient if you're looking for quality work.  Would use again."
positive,"We originally took our 1998 Jeep Cherokee to a transmission shop close to our home. I had warned my husband about how some shops will try to tell you right off the bat that you need a rebuild done (have experienced this many times in the past). The first shop gave us some crazy number of $1500 plus and that may not even solve the problem. So we decided to take it to AAMCO for a second opinion. Ricardo called and told us that they would require a few hours of labor to dive into the transmission and try to solve the problem for us. No matter how long it took, he would only charge us for two hours. That was cool with us. We heard from him the next day and he informed us that they couldn't diagnose the issue and most likely it had to do with the Electronic Control Module and that we should take it to a place that could look further into that. He also decided to not charge us anything for the time spent looking for the transmission issues. We ended up fixing the issue ourselves by cleaning the plugs on the ECM. If it weren't for Ricardo's honesty and idea to check the ECM, we would have most likely spent a fortune on fixing an issue that didn't exist- like what the first transmission shop wanted to charge for. In a world of repair shops that insist on raking people over the coals, it's nice to have a place like this AAMCO and someone like Ricardo who tells the truth and gives you great advice on top of it. Thank  you Ricardo!"
positive,"I have an 8 year old Mercedes C280 with 90,000 miles on it and the transmission started giving problems. I wouldn't consider taking it to a dealer and instead took it to one place that was highly recommended - and got an estimate for $2,200. But I didn't feel confident in them. So I brought it to M.B. Motors and was immediately impressed with their knowledge and professionalism. They pinpointed the problem very quickly and repaired it within a couple of days. The final bill was $1,500 and they did a super job. From now on I'll use them exclusively for all my servicing needs."
positive,"I have been taking my car here for a few months now for oil changes and other services. I am really happy with their efficiency, customer service and honesty. As a woman, I know I have been lied to in the past when having my car worked on. Fortunately, I know a fair amount about cars as my dad taught me, and am able to tell when mechanics are trying to make a sale for the most part. I have NEVER had that experience here. They have earned my business for more that just tires and oil changes- I recently had my brakes and rotors replaced and will have my transmission fluid changed very soon. Their prices are fair- I am sure on some services you could find slightly cheaper prices ($5-20 maybe), but overall I think they are competitively priced, and you're paying for quality work."
positive,"Sun Auto Service is a life saver! My fiancé and I were traveling from Southern California to Utah when we had unexpected car problems. I called and spoke to Jimmy on the phone and he told me to head in and he would immediately diagnose the issue and get everything fixed. We arrived at 4pm and Jimmy was able to diagnose the issue, get in contact with my warranty company, get the repairs approved and order the parts before 6pm. Turns out I needed to have my water pump and alternator replaced.

They were friendly, informative and well equipped to help. They had our car repaired by 10am the next morning and we were back on the road with no further issues. I highly recommend any of the Sun Auto locations in the Las Vegas area, they will go the extra mile to help you. All things considered they helped turn what could have been a horrible road trip experience into a pleasant and speedy bump in the 'road'. The guys here couldn't have been nicer."
positive,Awesome place.  We went to see if we needed a new muffler.  Most business would have said yes and charged accordingly.  He took a look and said a seal was blown.  Promply replaced it while we were out shopping and now our son's truck sounds quiet as a mouse.  Highly recommend this place.  :)
positive,"I have been to this shop several times having my car repaired over the last couple of years, and have NEVER had a problem with any of the work performed.  Every single time that I have been in, they have diagnosed, ordered parts for, and repaired my car in a timely manner.  Prices are VERY reasonable in comparison to other shops around town.  This is a ""mom and pop"" shop with a staff that is very knowledgeable in the repair field.  I wouldn't take my car anywhere else to be repaired.  The owner, John, is super friendly, listens to what your problem is and makes sure that everything is repaired the first time through.  I have had such services as A/C compressor replacement, emissions system work, water pump replacement as well as general maintenance.  Don't trust your car to just anyone, make the drive to Glendale Repairs and you won't be disappointed."
positive,"I first had my transmission rebuilt by Cottman's in February. Through a series of unfortunate events, I ended having to go back to them several times over the next few months. I have to say that initially I was skeptical that they would be able to resolve my issues to my satisfaction, but the GM, Bard, made sure I was satisfied, even extending my warranty because of the delay. Although things did not go perfectly, Bard and his staff were committed to making sure I was happy. That means a lot in today's environment of indifferent customer service. I have returned twice since for minor problems unrelated to the original repairs, and was extremely pleased with the service. I would absolutely recommend this company based on my personal experience."
positive,"Great Service - Great Prices!

The people who work here know what they're talking about and won't fix something that isn't broken. In fact, if you're doing something wrong, they'll show you how to do it right.

While I was waiting for my oil change; I wandered around the show room and spotted some really cool new syles available from really good Taiwanese Brands. If you want something that's not on the floor they'll order it for you, same day.

[If you don't know, Chinese brands are TERRIBLE and super cheap; BUT TAIWANESE brands are great -all the best manufacturing in the world occurs in Taiwan and Japan; semi-conductors/computer chips/engines/scooters -FYI]

When I got my scooter back, it ran better than ever! 
-It cost $30 for an engine oil change, transmission oil change and break check.

....now I want the laid-back Cali. touring scooter for cruising Tempe this summer (brand new it's under $2K for a 125cc!!!!!wow!!!)"
positive,check engine light came back on. Stopped in immediately....will update review when I get my car back. Don't want to give lower stars to mess up their rating if handled properly. Keep ya posted
positive,"These guys (along with my brother's extensive tool collection) have kept my 1995 E320 wagon going for over 211,000 miles. They are amazing. Great prices and free shipping on orders over $50. I ordered two flex disks and a transmission mount yesterday late morning and they were just delivered today at 9:30 am.  Can't beat that."
positive,"Before finding the guys at Huntersville Auto Tech I'd never been to the same shop twice to have my car repaired.  Since I found them, I haven't been to anyone else.  

You'll be treated fairly, if your car doesn't need to be fixed, they'll tell you.  If your car does need to be fixed, you'll get the most fair price you've ever gotten, and the work will be done right.  They also don't take a week to do a one or two day job.  If they had 6 stars they would get it."
positive,"I took my old 2002 Rav 4 to Firestone for an oil
change and I was told it needed 2 rear shocks, 2 front bushings, 2 arms, a transmission mount, and all 4 tires. Imagine my horror when they told me how much it would cost. I thought about getting rid of the car for good, despite its 3-yo transmission, because everytime I go to Firestone, they seem to find something that's wrong with it, costing me a lot of money. I mean it's an old car but I maintained it. I'm so glad I used Yelp and found H Tech Auto. I called them up and took the car there. Bernard was very helpful. Norman did the diagnostics, and he showed and explained to me what needed to be done. I was shocked that it only needed 2 rear shocks and a transmission mount as opposed to everything  Firestone wanted to do to that would've costed me a lot, just for the labor alone. Norman also found that Firestone over tightened the cap when they did my oil change, causing the washer to crack and the oil to leak out. They quoted me with a significantly lower price (parts and labor), only for the necessary things to be done and nothing more. I was very happy! Bernard even offered to take me to and pick me up from work when I drop off my car, since they had to order the parts. I dropped off my car 2 days later and they finished the job before the day was over. I met Pete, who did the job himself. He was super nice and very reassuring. I trust his expertise. Alex was also very helpful and accommodating. The whole team deserves more than 5 stars, in my opinion. They have great customer service, honest-to-goodness dealings, lower pricing, and they're trustworthy. I recommend this place to everyone who needs their car serviced or repaired. I'll never go back to Firestone."
positive,"After getting a brake job this afternoon (thanks, Rusty!), I was reminded that I have been getting great service from Bob and his gang for over 17 years. This is a great shop for getting oil changes, tire rotations, mufflers, brakes, and numerous other basic services. The prices have always been fair, the information great, and the services excellent. I always recommend this Meineke as a place you can trust."
positive,"On a trip from So. Cal. to Vegas my car overheated.  AAA towed the car to Tonys.
The service was excellent- Had an estimate to us within 2 hours and car repaired within then next 4 hours!.  I needed a new radiator, hoses, fan and thermostat-- First thing to ever be repaired on my 2005 Aviator -  The cost was surprisingly reasonable!  It would have easily been 60% higher in California for the same repairs.  
I would highly recommend."
positive,"I had originally installed a bolt on cat back system on my truck and was pretty happy with the results. I later decided I wanted to go more aggressive (louder) and picked up a new muffler and y pipe. The y pipe I had purchased wasn't quite the right size so they swapped it with one they had no problem. In and out with the new muffler and y pipe in less than an hour. Service was top notch and I am extremely happy with my new setup. Price was outstanding to boot, I will definitely return with any further exhaust work. Highly recommend!"
positive,"I brought my 1987 Corvette into this shop after it had spent a few years in a body shop for a full restoration. I had diagnostic issues with a check engine light and Ken the mechanic confirmed the codes I found and fixed my car right the first time. I asked him to do a rear differential service on my car since it had been sitting for years at the previous shop and when I returned to pick up my car he said, ""someone at the bodyshop must have already done this service as the fluids are clean and look new"". He could have easily have just done the service and I would have never known, Now that's an honest mechanic. I have met the owner Sung and I must say both Ken and Sung are very knowledgeable. I will be back to this shop. They will be working on my 1966 Cadillac this weekend as they work on both modern and classic cars. I have added this shop to my conacts list!"
positive,When I brought my car in to get my flat tire repaired in my oil change they found an oil leak that was that happened when my car was built they fixed it but then when I drove it away the check engine light came on and they said it was either when I took it back to him the next day they said it was either the oxygen sensor or the catalytic converter so they ordered the oxygen sensor they put it in today the check engine light went away but my car is still making a noise so I'm going to take it back to him tomorrow but they were very nice to me today they brought me home and when my car was ready they called me and I just want to say that there was a problem with my car they they came in they pick me up to bring me back to my car so I do want to thank them for that and I will I know they will take good care of me and fix this problem I'm having with my car much thanks to Nationwide Buick GMC and Denise
positive,"I've lived in Las Vegas for 2 years now and the first time I got my oil changed here I went to Jiffy Lube. I thought it was all good but as soon as I left, my car started smoking and my check engine light came on. I went back to them and they wiped it off so it stopped smoking however my light never went off and my car started running weird. I was looking for a reliable place that actually cares about their customers but is also affordable. I found this place and it was great. The staff, especially Joe, was welcoming and friendly. They had a cool waiting room, And when I got my car back it didn't smoke or have a light on. (How it should be) Definitely going back to them for any work I need done in the future."
positive,"Incredibly happy I found this place.   Although getting your car repaired is never fun or convenient, Tracy definitely makes the process painless and worry-free.

I am always impressed with the quality of their work, their customer service, and their honest, reasonable pricing. 

I wouldn't (and don't) go anywhere else for auto body repairs."
positive,"I brought my new (to me) '07 Toyota 4Runner to Mike and Mark after it started shifting strangely.  Mike and Mark assuaged my fears of a completely blown transmission.  They also clarified some misunderstandings I had about my vehicle, as well as brought me into the garage to show me my car on the lift.  They showed me the cause of my problems and carefully explained the service that my vehicle did (and did not) need.  

I was given a ride home, and was called in the afternoon (as promised) when my car was ready for pickup.

I am so glad to have found a local, trustworthy mechanic for my car."
positive,"We've had so many bad experiences with auto shops, I never thought we'd find someone we could actually trust. The guys at Rebel actually changed our minds about this. They are awesome....great at what they do, competitive prices and HONEST. If you take your vehicle there and ask them for something and you don't need it they'll actually tell you instead of ripping you off. They changed the transmission in our Lincoln truck and let us know that it was probably still under warranty, which I didn't even think to check. We ended up getting everything covered by the transmission company since it was a defect and we were so thankful! They've also worked on our other car and they always do the best job. Told us our brakes were fine when we came to get them changed (most places would just change them to get the money). I'm so thankful we found them and will recommend them to everyone we know."
positive,I got a cat back exhaust system installed from performance muffler about 6 years back using all the parts they had in house. Never had any issues since. The did a great job and would recommend them to others
positive,This is the best place to get your car repaired in town. I have taken my car elsewhere and spent a lot of money and it was not repaired correctly. These guys are very honest and fair with their prices and they get the job done quickly and correctly. Very nice people to do business with. I highly recommend them
positive,"They rotate tires for free even if you don't buy your tires there. Yeah, that's definitely their sales pitch, but I will definitely go back to a Discount Tire in the future for my tire needs. 

I was in and out in 20 minutes and didn't pay a dime. So much win."
positive,"I recently moved to AZ from CA.  I noticed some transmission fluid leaking and needed to take my GMC truck to a trustworthy shop to get fixed.  I asked a co-worker of mine if he knew of anyone local and he recommended Good Works.  So I took my truck in and Elsie, the shop lady, was super nice.  They ended up putting my truck on a lift and had me come in to review.  Standing underneath my truck Glenn and the crew pointed out what was wrong and showed me exactly what was leaking and made suggestions to fix.  I thought that approach was so cool as usually your left in some waiting room taking some guys suggestion for repair without even seeing what the issues are. Needless to say they fixed my truck and stood by their work.  I've taken my wife's Yukon in for repairs as well.  They are not the cheapest place in town but they do a great job and stand by their work.  Without a doubt I have had the best experience for car repairs with Good Works Auto Repair!  Highly recommended!!"
positive,"I can't say enough good things about this shop. First, disclaimer, I was ASE certified *many* years ago, before most cars had computer controlled systems. So I like to think I know enough to not be deceived by auto shops.

I have frequented Marshall's Service Center for years, and been perfectly happy with them, except for one small issue. They are 10 miles from my house. So any lengthy service that requires dropping the vehicle off (they don't have shuttle service) can be a pain. So the only reason I tried Community was initially because they are close, and because ABC 15 news did a ""smart shopper"" segment on them so I thought, ""How bad could they be?""

I started off with a simple oil change, tire rotation, and ""could you please check some kind of fluid leak behind the left rear tire?"" I elected to hang out in the lobby, and within 15 minutes the tech came in and asked me to come look at the vehicle on the rack. He found my left rear shock was ""shot"" and leaking fluid. It was clear to me that was causing the stain on my garage floor, so I went ahead with replacement of that.

I had also mentioned an odd shifting problem with the auto transmission. They found my transmission pan gasket leaking which *might* be causing the transmission to slip due to low fluid levels. I opted to hold off on that for a few weeks and come back for a full transmission system flush and gasket replacement.

As the repair went on, I listened to a conversation with another customer in the lobby with Lorenzo, the service manager. The customer had been told by a Chevrolet dealership that his PCV valve was bad, which was causing a performance problem with his vehicle but that ""the valve and the valve cover for the head is one piece"" and must be replaced together, all told costing $700. Myself, and Lorenzo, thought that sounded suspicious so Lorenzo (free of charge) made some phone calls for the customer to find that the PCV valve was SEPARATE from the valve cover, and cost a mere $5 for the PCV valve. The customer could swap that out themselves rather than paying the tech to do it or let Community do it for a small charge.

All that said, it's clear to me that Community treats customer's well, and they don't try to pull a fast one and make you spend money you don't need to. Further, I've had a nagging ""clanking"" noise in the front end of my vehicle for 2 years that no one has been able to isolate. The tech at Community took my vehicle for a test drive after replacing shocks and changing the oil, and relayed that he heard the sound I had complained about. He took another look at the vehicle and said, ""Oh, it's your stabilizer, the bushing is worn and every time I drove over a bump in the road, it made that noise."" Now that said, the repair is 10+ hours which means about $1000 to fix, but the tech made it clear this isn't a safety issue, just an annoyance. Until, of course, it gets really worn and then could be a safety issue but I was just impressed after ONE drive of the vehicle, he knew what the problem was (and again, he SHOWED me).

I can't say enough about the integrity of this shop. I'll be coming back again with all of my vehicles. Not withstanding my love of Marshall's Service Center, these guys are only 5 miles from my house and they're awesome :)"
positive,"Anything exhaust related on my car, I come here to get it fixed. I been referred here to get my exhaust work done here. I came here a total of 4 times, 2 times to get my muffler fixed, ! time to get my exhaust manifold fixed, and 1 time to get a exhaust leak fixed. Every time they called to explain what needed fixed and gave me a price. Everything my car was fixed in a timely manner. I usual dealt with Mark who was friendly and did profession work. Prices do seem kind of high but that's my only complaint. I will continue to come here but hopefully something doesn't go wrong with my car in awhile."
positive,"I recently needed some work done on my 2004 Passat. I have been to this location a few times before for a assortment of repairs but over the past week they truly helped me. First my battery died and I took it to Volkswagen North Scottsdale and Tom Radtke was the Service representative that took care of me. I expressed my need to have my car asap and even though they were fully booked for that day Tom made sure to squeeze my car in and had it back to me in a matter of hours. Later that week my check engine light or MIL light came on, I made an appointment Monday morning to see Tom again for the new issue. He was extremely helpful and made sure to get back to me as soon as possible to keep me informed about what needed to be done on my car. I have received extremely consistent customer service at this location in the Service Department. I truly appreciated the high level of service I received from Tom, and while I hopefully won't be back too soon for more repairs I now have a trusted person and location I can go to! Thank you Tom Radtke!"
positive,"Bruce is amazing! He helped my Mom get her car repaired after a collision and we couldn't be happier with the results. It's like she has a new car! It handles better than it did before the accident and looks amazing. Even the interior was detailed! The insurance was going to total the car and that would have been a problem for my mom. Bruce stepped in. I don't know what he did if anything, but the insurance company decided it was worth fixing and now she has a ""like new"" car again. It was pretty fast turnaround too. I would give Bruce 10 stars if Yelp would let me! Thanks, Bruce, for taking such great care of my Mom and her car."
positive,"I took in my Toyota Tundra pickup because of a check engine light. There were two bad sensors causing issues. Avi the owner/mechanic took good care of my truck. He showed me both the old parts and the diagnostic reports which means a lot. I do my own routine maintenance and have done larger repairs in the past, so I know my way around an engine. I didn't feel ripped off once everything was done and I know my truck will be on the road for years to come. I would recommend Courtesy Auto Repair."
positive,"After my car being at Chevy dealer an entire day and they never even looked at it, I called here and then drove right over after talking to Liz. In 5 minutes they told me I did NOT have a transmission problem, unlike the dealer. It turned out I needed new spark plugs. I had brakes replaced and they found a few other minor things that needed fixing and got it all done in a few hours and at a reasonable price. Liz even got me a rental car for the day so I didn't have to miss anymore time from work.  I can't say enough good thing about this place!! I will be getting all my service and repairs done here from now on."
positive,Had a couple mufflers replace at Performance Muffler on my 1962 Chevy ll. Russ the owner is a knowledgeable and very good at what he does. The quality of the work is excellent I highly recommend using Performance Muffler. Thanks Russ keep up the hard work.
positive,"Honest employees did a great job.I was weary of going to an AAMCO. I have been to other AAMCOs and have had unbelievably bad experiences. Yet, this AAMCO had a coupon on their website for a transmission fluid flush for $60 bucks, nearly half off! The staff was very courteous and prompt. I called in the evening and they got me an appointment the next morning on a SAT! They were respectful, quick, and didn't feed me any bull about something wrong with my vehicle like every other shady mechanic in AZ. They did exactly what I paid AAMCO to do and they did it well. After the flush my transmission is running brand new and was an amazing deal to help further the lifetime of my transmission. These guys are honest and will make me a repeat customer for my future transmission needs! Thanks guys!"
positive,"I had originally gotten an oil chain at one of their competitors when I found out that my transmission was leaking, but the original place I got my oil change did not fix  transmission leaks. I have only lived in the area a couple years and didn't know where to go but was told to go to Good Works. They offered to look at my transmission free of charge. They took me back and showed me what was wrong and explained it in terms I understood since I don't know that much about vehicles. They told me it wasn't an issue now but will be in the future they said to come back every few months or so and will check it out. I plan to get all of my car needs repaired by Good Works from now on!"
positive,"While visiting family in AJ for Thanksgiving, I needed to find a shop to do an oil change on my 35-foot Class A motor-home.  I called to see if they could accommodate an RV of this size and if they could do the work that day, without an appointment.  They told me it would be no problem and quoted me right around $55.00.  I was in and out in right around an hour.  They did the routine inspection, lubed the chassis and added a quart of transmission fluid.  I had them use synthetic oil (about 4x the cost @ $5.00-6.00/qt)  My total bill was right around $80.00 +tax.  I can't complain!"
positive,Had to go here 3x to get what i wanted and they always worked out on the time I wanted. I was gonna go to the muffler shop near me and got quoted $139 on the same thing they did to me for 40$. So the 15 min drive is worth the low price they quote you and the quality of work they put into. Definitely the way to go in terms of muffler/exhaust problem/customization.
positive,"This was by far the best experience I have ever had with an auto shop. 

My girlfriend and I were traveling across the country from Boston to San Francisco, and Vegas was one of our stops on the trip. Everyone's biggest nightmare when driving cross country is having mechanical problems, and breaking down. We started to have acceleration problems and the check engine light was on, so we decided to get it looked at in Vegas.

I called early in the morning, when the shop opened, in order to make an appointment and make sure that I had enough time for the car to be fixed. When I called I was told that no appointment was needed and that I could just bring the car in... needless to say I was stunned and amazed.

When I brought it in Hamid took my keys, informed me that they had a great selection of coffee, sodas, and cookies that I could enjoy while I waited - I was pretty happy at this point. After a short time, my car was brought into the garaged and diagnosed. Not only did Hamid give me a diagnosis for what could potentially be wrong with my car, he also gave me a diagnosis of everything else that was wrong with my car, with great descriptions and prices!!!

I ended up getting a couple of things fixed, one the could have been related to my problem, and the other that was completed unrelated, a cracked coolant reservoir,  which Hamid suggested I should absolutely get fixed due to the fact that we were driving across the country and going through some hot areas. The entire experience was amazing!

I don't know how other auto shops are around Vegas, but there is no need to go anywhere else, Hamid and his mechanics are amazing and very friendly."
positive,"I first read through all Tony's Yelp reviews. Had to laugh at the couple 1 stars reviews.  Sounded like more a language barrier between the front desk and client. Oh well we can't make everyone happy all the time.

Here's my review in a nut shell.  My Mercedes check engine light came on and the engine stalled out on are way into Vegas.  We were lucky enough to be within 30 miles of town when it happen. The AAA tow company came out and referred us to Tony's.    After arriving Tony warned us that he was busy but would fit us in asap. He called the next day and explained We  needed a fuel pump. Gave us a verbal estimate which we authorized.  The car was fixed that same day with what I considered a very reasonable price.  The car runs great and I'm very happy with the results of his repairs. 

I'm very thankful for the referral the tow truck campany gave me to Tony's. I'm also in the auto repair business and have to admit that it was very hard for me to trust another shop to work on my Benz. But Tony and his crew did a great job. 

 So I write this review with great confidence that he treats all his old and new clients with the same respect and also prices his repair job correctly. 

Great job Tony

Thanks again 

Alan"
positive,"I just had my transmission rebuilt here. Jack is polite, has great follow-up, and went above and beyond for me.  I highly recommend this location and especially Jack."
positive,"My wife and I were visiting our son in Henderson and it was time for an oil change. Called Rebel and Joe worked me in. Infact, I think he did the service himself. Joe & Lee have also serviced our son's car transmission & brakes. Top shelf kind of guys. I feel they're shop can be trusted with any service needed."
positive,"I was Shopping around for a muffler and not really sure of what I was looking for but Russ helped me out! This company is knowledgeable, gave me a quote over the phone and that's exactly what I paid.  I even left my truck over night because of my schedule and when I picked it up there were no issues and the work and parts they installed are working great! My truck sounds awesome.  Thx!"
positive,"Great place for general car repairs, tires, etc. We have gotten excellent service through the years. We first started going to the West Side Car-X because my cousin works there but we have generally been impressed with everyone, the quality and speed of the work, etc. Our experience in other states (e.g. NY) has not been good with muffler shops, but we very much recommend this place."
positive,"I got check engine light on and had some rattling noise from the left exhaust. I found this shop online and decided to give it a try. I was somewhat suspicious about all the five-star reviews before I went there but guess what, they definitely deserve more than that! I explained to Bud, the owner, what happened to my car and the things I did. I can tell that he is a great listener and honest man. He said:"" I will tell you if I don't know but I will find it out."" I very much admire his honesty. In addition, he explained very thing to me in great detail and he shared his knowledge with me generously. Personally, I am a DIYer and have done several projects on my cars. I asked him about a few difficulties I have encountered, and he shared with me what he would do and what tools I will need. Bud is such a great mechanic! This is the shop I will bring my car in for as long as I own a MB."
positive,"This is my favorite place to get an oil change. Always fast, great prices with the Groupon deal, really not a better place in town for full synthetic oil changes. This time I had my transmission serviced and power steering fluid changed. Only added about 30 mins to my trip."
positive,Have car repaired here two times without any problem. I feel they are trustworthy honest reliable and friendly.
positive,"Not only have I purchased my Toyota from Erin Park, but I've had it serviced here for 9 of the 12years that I've owned my Toyota.  I'll try and focus on my recent trips for the sake of this review

Pros
- my Sales rep remembers me by name, and I haven't bought a car from her in 12 years
- they go above and beyond for their customers -- when a check engine light came on, they were able to see me the next day, and were clear upfront that they may not be able to get to it. (Meadowvale Toyota wanted me to come back a week later)
- most of the service advisors are very pro-active providing me with updates 

Cons
- service can be slow, if you're waiting or on a time crunch you need to communicate that to them when you book your appointment AND when you bring in your car"
positive,"Well... there goes my Christmas money. I took my car in because of a oil leak today. I walked in at 12pm left at 1:50pm. Fair time. I was expecting it to be a lot longer, but they had at least 5 auto technicians on the job and had at least 4 more cars before mine. I was surprised, well not really, that the customer service personnel at the counter were so nice on the phone and in person. The young man that helped me out today was very patient and nice. I was not helped by the woman, wish I got both of their names, was real cool too. Anyway it took that time and I was told that I was going to need to take off the oil pan to get to the leak and I also asked for an overall maintenance check out. Had that done.

  I was pissed tho. I was pissed at the work my previous auto shops sloppy job that did my transmission on my car and how it was coming back to haunt me with this oil leak problem. I had my transmission rebuild by someone else and when they had that done they sealed off my oil pan so hard that it had three layers of a gasket on it. I am guessing so in the future it wont ever drip. But it was sealed poorly and I am guessing that the liquid nails, Not what is supposed to be sealed with, was not allowed to cool off in time to have it permanently sealed so it was still leaking. 

  long story short I had to pay for another new one because this one was so tite the tech had to use a prie bar to take it off. Now that I am thinking about it... that way of taking it off could have damaged something else, but thats the risk I took and it came out fine. Anyway I did an oil change with a new filter, fixed an issue i did not know with my e break that was not looking all that properly, and that oil issue. Oh, also adjust and clean my breaks, air filter, remove & replace windshield washer fluid reservoir. It all came out to $696.20.

  I think the lesson I took away is to not look to cut corners on MAJOR repairs. Biggest payments were the maintenance on the Oil Pan Gasket and the windshield washer reservoir. It was all done at 5:30ish. Man I am still blown away by this mistake of taking it to these other guys... Thank goodness I found this place so close to my house. I will be coming here again later this year for more the final things to be done. Oh one more thing I had no idea I needed to do my smog check by next week!!! I didn't receive anything in the mail. Although I should keep track of it but still... (Car that was worked on was a 2001 Nissan Sentra GXE)"
positive,"I have to say, the General Manager, Jody has taken control of my problems. They had a new builder re-build my transmission completely. They took the time to communicate and assisted me with understanding every step. I am very happy with the outcome and my car is finally driving as it should! 
Thank you for taking the customer concern serious and doing the right thing!"
positive,Stopped by for a quick check engine light diagnosis. Quick and Efficient. Customer Service was great and stepped out with satisfaction. That's all I would care for.
positive,"So we rolled into Vegas at about 3pm on Thursday afternoon and my check engine light had been on since half way through the ride from San Diego.  We had to stop at the gas station down the street on Flamingo Rd. to wash up and change in a very gypsy like fashion.

Trying to keep it cool and on the safe side(and mainly on a budget) I decided it was best to have my SUV diagnosed, did a google search and I came across R&R Auto on Ogden St.
When we rolled up I was amazed to see that these guys had a huge shop with over six ports and all of them were full, which lead me to believe they have their shit together....sure nuff, in no time I told the lady at the counter what the problem was and I hadn't waited more than 5 minutes when one of the Tech's came out with a high-end scanner that was able to tell me exactly why my check engine light was on.

In the meanwhile my wife and 4 yo daugter were able to cool off inside of the office with soda and water while they watched TV on the couch.

Apparently a vacuum plug had fallen off and my manifold needed some cleaning, needless to say these guys took care of it within the hour and also performed a leak test on my vacuum system. Their prices are waaaay below dealer cost and I was more than happy to pay for their expedient service, it's like they were conscious that were tourists and didn't want to spend our vacation time in a shop

The day before we left we stopped to get an oil change and they even gave us a lift to the old strip and picked us up so we wouldn't have to wait around while our car was serviced.  Keep up the good work guys!!!  Highly recommend it.

Pros:
Clean shop
Fast service
Honest family owned business.

Cons:

positive,"I went to get my tire fixed, they got me in & out which was perfect!!  I needed my car looked at because it was bouncing all over the place!  So, I bought my car in they took it for a spin  and said I,  My 2008 Blue mustang needed struts & shocks.  So I bought my car in the next day to have my car repaired - after they got through working on  my car, low & behold, My ""Pearl Blue"" mustang was "" purring"" down the highway once again!!  Evidently!  They know what thier doing & know how to work on my particular car and it truly shows.  My mustang shines inside & out!!  You know why,  because the LOVE shows through thier repair work on your car and the customer service is FANTASTIC!!!  THANKS DIMAGGIOS again!!"
positive,"So here I am AGAIN.

For the third time too. This time it was just a ""get rid of the credit union"" mission. I financed my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu through America First Credit Union based in Utah. So everything was fine until they started sending me requests for proof of insurance on my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu LTZ that I had purchased from AutoNation Buick GMC West Sahara. As soon as I got the windows tinted on my Malibu, I picked it up and drove it home and called my insurance agent with State Farm. I sent them the forms that America First Credit Union had sent me. They wanted to named lien holder of the Malibu so if it was wrecked, they got the loan paid off from my insurance company. No problem with that. They also wanted proof of coverage on my Malibu from the first day I bought it, which was March 16th, and according to my insurance agent with State Farm, I had a 15 day grace period to add the Malibu to my policy with my Lexus at the time being full coverage. So I did this as soon as I possibly could. I got this same request from America First Credit Union twice, and twice I sent the forms to my insurance agent through fax. Then America First Credit Union hit me with a $3400 insurance policy against my 2011 Malibu, because the information my insurance agent was not to ""their liking"". So now they really upset me, so I decided on either refinancing the Malibu or possibly getting another car because I was ""DONE"" with America First Credit Union. They also bumped my payments up from $346 a month to $402 a month, but didn't extend my loan term.

So I went to AutoNation Buick GMC West Sahara where I bought the Malibu in the first place. I asked for my salesman Devon Harger to be there when I got there at 8am. He's the only person I will do business with besides Denzell Williams because these two men have earned my trust completely. So I drove two 2015 Chevrolet Impalas that were fully loaded. One was an LTZ, the other was a 2LT, but all in all, nice cars. I was hoping to break even on the trade by putting down a little money, and by cancelling the extended warranties and other add ons I got for the Malibu. I wasn't expecting to have to go through another car purchase to dump America First Credit Union. So after doing a ""trade appraisal"" I knew I had negative equity and I realized that doing a refinance on my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu wasn't feasible. Banks won't finance a car for more than what it's worth when attempting to do a refinance. So this led me to the last two options: I could keep my Malibu which I loved and still love, or I could look at other vehicles that were 20% off including Buick Regal, and GMC Acadia. I chose to drive a 2016 Buick Regal, and decided to run the numbers on this particular car to see where I would be at payment wise. I was now already paying $402 a month for my Malibu thanks to America First Credit Union, and the payments on a 2016 Regal were just $54 more a month. Why so high? We were able to wipe out all of the negative equity by cancelling everything we could with the 2011 Malibu, we used the 20% off on the Buick Regal to take care of the rest of it along with 1k from me, which under the circumstances was not too much to ask. I'm even getting a free window tint on this Regal. 

Features that I will miss from my Malibu:
Bose Audio system, Dark Red paint job, Bigger than the Regal, and the V6 3.6 engine (very sporty performance for a mid size sedan). 
How ever, I got a few bonus's from buying the Regal:
V4 Turbo charged engine which acts like a V6 but won't eat much gas, a modern built in Navigation System with Pandora and Apple Car Play built in, Cream Colored White paint job, and a nice Buick Interior. Both vehicles had remote start, ambient lighting, window tints, dual exhaust, and nice 18 alloy wheels. 

So I thought to myself, it's a trade off on a few things, and a gain on a few things. What's more important to me right now? Doing business in my vehicles for Real Estate, and banking with a trusted credit union out here in Nevada, keeping the money local to our economy. And, The Buick Regal's engine and transmission are built here in the United States of America. Its final point of assembly is in Canada though, but considering that Canada is a huge trading partner of the United States, I can live with it. The vital componants of the car are made here at least. So overall, I am happy with the car, and I'm sure in time I will come to love it, but again, I'm happy with the performance of Devon Harger, Doug (the finance guy in the office) who didn't pressure me into anything,  and Steve (Finance Guy behind the computer screen) because I was given a much fairer deal here on my trade and on the purchase of the 2016 Regal than I would have been given at Fairway Chevrolet on the purchase on a 2016 Chevrolet Impala LTZ or 2LT (which they didn't have any 2Lts). To top it off, again thanks to everyone at AutoNation Buick GMC West Sahara! I won't go anywhere else to buy a car!"
positive,"I've rented a bay there whenever one of my cars needed work. Prior to my first rental, I had to watch a video and sign a release. they drove my car in and put it up on the lift. Understand, this establishment only rents you a lift and tools. It's not meant to be an ordinary mechanic's  garage.

As the owner of a couple of foreign cars, including a diesel Mercedes, it's hard to find places that won't take you for an arm-and-a-leg just to change the oil. I bring my own oil, filters and tools. I'm usually in-and-out in an hour. 

There are entire tool chests for rent (with air tools) for an additional $10/hr. They can order whatever parts you need, from oil and filters all the way to crate motors/transmissions. There is access to online Mitchell Manuals if you need a reference materials. I just wish they had a parts cleaner. 

If you get in over your head (I have), ask for Rick. He will help you or take over the job for a reasonable price. I've seen him working on Ferraris, Porsches and Mercedes. 

There has been some confusion. I've seen other ""professional"" mechanics in there. Remember, they rent a bay just like you. I've seen some pretty cheesy activity by some of these guys (Hello, Don). If Rick works on your car (at your request) you will get a U-Fix-It receipt. He stands behind his work. He did on one of my cars."
positive,"These guys are great. I was having some problems with my Audi A4 (oil pressure, and check engine light on) and they took a look at my car right away. Eventually they had determined that I needed a new oil pump and called me with an estimate. When I told them I was going to check with the Audi dealership to see if my car was still under warranty to take care of the repairs (which it was), they gave me no trouble at all and accommodated my needs by allowing me to pick up my vehicle after hours to drive it to the dealership. By the time they had found out what was wrong, they had spent two hours on it for which I was charged roughly $160 ($79/hour for labor).
Not only that, Rock went out of his way to unlock my girlfriend's running car when she accidentally locked herself out right outside their shop. Cannot give these guys enough credit! Very reliable, understanding, and friendly service. 
Will be back without a doubt!"
positive,"I started having trouble with my Pontiac Grand Prix about fifty miles south of flagstaff, and when I finally got it down to Tempe we took it right over to Good Works. Deeanna recalled off the top of her head how much a check engine light inspection would be and made me feel very welcome. As it was late in the day, I received my inspection link early the next morning and realized there was A LOT wrong with my high mileage baby. The breakdown of the bill was SO HELPFUL and helped us pinpoint how much it was going to cost to get it back home to Farmington, New Mexico to get to our family mechanic. They covered the minor repair to clear the limp mode on the car in the inspection charge. Brian was wonderful over the phone and super helpful. Going to pick up my baby in a couple hours to get her home."
positive,"I needed my car repaired quickly and at a fair price. I got exactly that with Mike and his guys. Good, quick mechanics that won't upsell you or try to do unnecessary repairs. Mike explained to me exactly what the issue was and even showed me the old part after it was replaced. You get honest, reliable service at Car Guyz. I will be bringing my car back whenever I need service!"
positive,"Need a good auto repair place, this is it. 

I have been using Terry's for over 8 years. I was introduced to Terry's Auto by a friend.  Since that time, I have used this place exclusively for my cars. 

It is very tough to find an auto mechanic that you can trust.  With Terry's, I drop my car off, tell them what I need and walk out. I come back, usually by the end of the day, and he is done.  Fair price without a worry. 

Have been taking my wifes 1997 Chrysler there for years. Have had new transmission, new sets of tires, and multiple other basic maintenance.  A vehicle that probably would not have lasted more than 100k miles is still running well at 150k plus miles. 

Terry has even been kind enough to work with me on payments when I had transmission installed. 

Can't promise he will do the same with you, but then, I have been going to him for 8 years. 

Need a good mechanic, look no further..."
positive,"Thank you Tobias for you recent service on my HHR. Within a week you got my transmission replaced!! I am back on the road. Big Kudos to Chuck over at the Cave Creek location. 

To all of my Yelp friends, if you need a referral for a great automotive repair shop and servicing center go to Tobias Automotive Specialists"
positive,"Was referred to Performance Muffler by Cars Complete Auto Care, performance Muffler did a great job for a very reasonable price. Instead of ""selling me"" a new muffler, they quickly repaired the one I had. Great to find an honest repair shop."
positive,"These guys are able to diagnose the check engine lights and give you solutions to the problems your car may have.  They have always had the parts I needed and the staff has been courteous and knowledgeable regarding the issues I have had. 

They offer a lot of free services from battery installations, testing alternators to even windshield wiper installations.

They just helped me fix my dreaded check engine light at a fraction of the costs of other places."
positive,"I drove in from California and out of nowhere my car started to act funny and my check engine light came on. I called several places and I just kept getting astronomical quotes or people saying it will take a few days to get it fixed. Not only was Marco able to see me right away, he was very helpful and made me feel at ease. This hands down was the most pleasant experience I've had at an auto repair shop. Thank you so much!"
positive,"I've been getting my 'ole changed here for 'bout 14 years now.  Yes, I meant to say ""'ole"" and not ""oil"".

It costs about $35 for the 'ole change, but if you're a repeat customer, you will receive a $3.00 coupon, bringing the total, along with the tax that we owe our blessed governor to $33.

It may seem like a pricey 'ole change, but they don't just change your 'ole.  They also check and adjust your tire pressure, vacuum your floorboard, top off your windshield washer fluid, brake fluid and power steering fluid (if applicable), inspect your air filter, and lubricate your axles (if applicable).  I buy my own air filters at Wal-Mart for like $8.00.  They offer other services like automatic transmission fluid replacement with T-Tech.

While you're waiting for you 'ole change, you get to listen to music, breathe some exhaust-filled air, and read Popular Mechanics.  What fun!  Two of the mechanics have been working here for quite some time and they are friendly and excellent at what they do."
positive,"Hamid the owner really caters to his customers. I first walked in and pleasantly surprised to find that it was comparable to the Lexus dealership waiting room, on a smaller scale. The waiting area is comfortable with a variety of beverages and even a small freezer for ice cream that is provided to the customers. The bathrooms and lobby was very clean and comfortable. For service, I only got an oil change but they were fast, VERY reasonable, and professional. I have gone to 4 other automotive shops for a quote on my transmission and was told that it would cost anywhere from $3400-$4000. Hamid gave me a quote of $2800. I will definately come back and recommend that anyone looking  for automotive work, come here!!"
positive,"Not only is this my go-to place for muffler work, I have also had my brakes done here, as well as a tire rod. I went to the old Chevy dealer in N. Olmsted and they told me I needed a whole new exhaust ($700), went here and they replaced my muffler for $50. Since then I have been a loyal customer, recommending all I can to them to save money.

Be there before they open in the AM. so your car will be first to get worked on. You should have your car back in a few hours. By far, the most affordable (down right cheap) muffler work in the city. And, NO ladies, this place will tell you the truth about what is wrong with your car (if your completely clueless, like me). Great job All Star!"
positive,"I'm not one to do reviews on yelp but I had to for this shop.  WOW!! Is all I have to say about John Jay Automotive.  I have a 2000 Honda Civic Si, it HAD a check engine light on for running rich and a couple other issues that stemmed from that.  I took my vehicle to two different shops that only work on Honda and Acura vehicles.  They couldn't figure out the issue after having my vehicle for 3-4 days at each shop, I was very lost on what to do, I felt I was in trouble. Upon further digging for shops and reading reviews I found John Jay Automotive.  As soon as I walked into John Jay Automotive I was greeted by the son of Jay.  Not only was he professional but Jay immediately walked out and started talking to me about my vehicle.  Not only did I feel at ease but I was talked to like a human and not just a dollar sign.  Upon leaving my vehicle I was always updated daily regarding repairs and what they found and what the cause was and how they were going to repair it.  John Jay Automotive is like no other repair shop I've ever been too.  They went above and beyond my expectations and even did little extra things that no other shop would have done.  Once my vehicle was finished I was called and given my pricing for repairs completed and I was so surprised and relieved, not only did they make the repairs and find the issues but no more check engine light.  John Jay Automotive is an HONEST, RELIABLE, and FAIRLY priced repair shop that I couldn't be more happy with.  They don't try to overcharge you or charge your for things you don't need.  I will from now on take ALL my vehicles back here and I will be referring as many people as I can here, and I highly recommend them to anyone reading this."
positive,"Bell Union is the most honest mechanical shop I have ever been too. I took my truck to 2 other places, both gave me a different estimate and service recommendation for fixing my transmission. I took it to Sung and Ken and they walked me through every part, fluid and piece so I could understand it. It turns out that it didn't even need any servicing yet! They saved me from throwing away hundreds of dollars! If you want the truth, go check these guys out!"
positive,"Amazing service by Jimmy and Sean G. Super friendly and fast service.
The price was so much lower compared to other places and the job was done better than it would have been at a dealership. 
I heavily recommend coming here for any maintenance, service or transmission issues. 
Their lounge is also really comfy compared to most places. Normally I leave to go to a Starbucks but I was given coffee and comfy seat. 
If you go anywhere else, you're missing out."
positive,"My check engine light was on so I took my car to them in order to pass smog. They took care of the problem, and helped me pass within a couple days. Very knowledgeable,  very informative and helpful. Both Joe and Lee always give me accurate info, price and time estimates. A week later my fuel injection went out so I had it towed to them. Luckily nothing else was damaged so I had them do a tune up while it was there. Car is running great and I highly recommend them.  I will keep coming back."
positive,"I called WW Williams, an authorized Allison Dealer, in Phoenix about a delay shift problem on my Allison transmission installed in my Tiffin Phaeton motorhome from Pahrump, NV. Jim, the Service Manager, invited me to bring it in for a diagnostic check. Upon arrival several days later after completing my stay in Pahrump, Javier Carrara was assigned as my Service Advisor. A work order was written up for my specific problem. I mentioned to Javier that we live in our motorhome full time and I was assured that a service tech would be assigned asap. We left to have lunch somewhere close by. A few hours later, Javier contacted me to inform me that a software update was applied to the TCM  (transmission control module) and that the service tech had driven it for about 7 miles and could not duplicate my problem. Since it was already in the shop, I requested a fluid and filter change, which was eventually performed. I was contacted by the evening shift service advisor, Jason, who indicated that our coach was ready. I requested a test drive with a service tech (Josh) to ensure the delay shift problem was resolved. Sure enough, shifted like butter now!! All it required was that software update to fix my shifting problem. Josh took the time during my test drive to explain the functions of the transmission and the shifting process which was a great help in understanding it from an owner's perspective.

This is a rather lengthy review but, to net it out, WW Williams resolved my shifting problem in a day allowing me to take possession of my home and continue my journey without requiring an over night stay in a hotel!! My thanks to all of the staff at WW Williams for the care, expertise and professionalism displayed and exhibited during my maintenance and repair procedures.

I would certainly not hesitate to have future work required on my Allison performed at WW Williams and would highly recommend them to others needing Allison transmission repair or maintenance."
positive,"I came to Findlay's service department after being treated horribly at Henderson Chevy. My 2010 Malibu had been having issues since I bought it September 16, 2014.  This past weekend was horrible and I decided I needed to have another dealership look at her. I took her in on 1/7/2015 Wayne was my service adviser. He was amazing!!!!! He listened to me and actually seemed like he cared and really wanted to get my car fixed. I have had an issue with my car running rough that Henderson Chevy made me feel like I was crazy, but Wayne started my car and said ""Your car has a rough idle"". All I could think was I knew I wasn't crazy! Well a really long story short my transmission needs to be flushed because the fluid in there is overheating and dirty. I'm not thrilled I have to pay for a service Henderson Chevrolet should of done months ago, but i am happy that my car will be better. I will continue to come to Findlay Chevy for all my car service needs.  Thank you so much!!!!"
positive,"Yelp did not disappoint. This was 1 of 3 my wife narrowed down for a transmission service & general diagnostics. First stop was really expensive & quoted a 3 hour wait. My wife directed me to Hamid & team at Busy Buggy. Not only was the transmission service less expensive than CARS on Valley View, it was also completed in 1 hour. Hamid also made recommendations to repair in the future without pressure & upselling. Other mechanics have used fear tactics if the upsell is rejected & remark ""be careful out there,"" with an obviously sarcastic tone. Not the experience here. Great complementary Keurig coffee, ice cream and cookies...as far as auto shops go, who else does that in Vegas? Thanks Busy Buggy for your great service when your competitors were only concerned about closing up shop to start their New Years Eve parties. Hat's off to you!"
positive,"I have been to this shop multiple times and have always received great service from Joe and his team. This shop was highly recommended to me and I would highly recommend this shop to anyone in need of  exhaust work or install. They offer quality work and great pricing. 

My fourth time using the shop I was in a pinch and needed work done to my Audi....ASAP. Although they were slammed, Joe made me feel like a priority and got the work done on his own time. My mechanic at Audi came with me to the shop and was blown away by the quality of work that Joe did on my car. 

****Regarding the review by Ken F, I too am a minority and have never once felt this way about Joe or anyone on his team. I am sorry that you felt this way about your experience. I know that this was a misunderstanding and  hope that you will give these guys another shot. I know that your perception is your reality, but in this case your perception of this shop is wrong and they deserve another chance. Thanks for listening.**** 

Thanks again Joe. I will continue to refer people to you and you are the only muffler shop I will use."
positive,"Great honest work. I had another shop do transmission work, and I had nothing but troubles afterwards. I found el jesse's shop online and brought my Jeep in. They repaired it at a good price, and when something else sprang up after the initial repair they fixed it at only the cost of parts. I'll definitely return if I need any more transmission work."
positive,"This is my favorite car service shop on the entire planet! Every time I've ever brought in a vehicle I feel I've been treated fairly and squarely by first-rate professionals, who bend over backwards to take care of you; giving you the straight scoop on your vehicle; and they don't try to sell you anything that isn't truly ready to be replaced. Let's face it, taking a vehicle in for service isn't typically anyone's idea of a barrel of fun.  

And, who hasn't at some point in their lives had a vehicle in for something simple, such as an oil change, only to get handed an estimate of $1,759 (or a lot more) for supposed repairs your vehicle may not truly need? Not to mention that if you object to any of the estimate, particularly the most farfetched part of it, you may be told something to the effect that your vehicle ""could blow up,"" or ""the wheels will fall off, "" or ""you could be left stranded on the freeway,"" etc. If you're like me, you've been told this sort of thing many, many times. 

That doesn't ever happen at Kelly Clark, as they don't suggest replacing something unless you actually need the repair. In my mind, their integrity is as immaculate as the squeaky-clean waiting room. Customers just want honesty, and you'll get it at Kelly Clark. And they also do a better job of explaining exactly what is going on with your car than any place I have ever had a vehicle in for service. 

One if my favorite experiences here was when I brought a car brought a car in here, extemporaneously, that I was thinking of buying and asked them to do a complete inspection of the vehicle (as the owner had no documented maintenance records); and I was a little leery of taking a stranger's word for how well the car had been maintained.  Naturally, the owner of the vehicle was not too thrilled we were there (since the car was pristine in his mind), but he agreed to have the inspection as a condition of selling the car.

Fortunately, as I anticipated, Kelly Clark immediately jumped to attention and whipped the car in and out in a very timely fashion, replete with an assessment (either ""pass"" or ""fail"" for everything they checked).  And the final price ($57) was not only extremely reasonable, but it was also below the quote!  

I ended buying the car, with peace of mind, thanks to Kelly Clark and their excellent service.

UPDATE: 18 months - and 29k miles later - this car has not had a single repair, other than regular maintenance which was recommended by Kelly Clark at the time of the inspection (and corroborated by other facilities that subsequently arrived at the same conclusion): flushing the transmission fluid, brake pads, and flushing the power steering fluid. Kelly Clark was spot on!

UPDATE 2: 26 months - and 48k miles later - this car has only had one repair: a stuck lug nut. Meaning, that Kelly Clark's recommendation to buy the car turned out to be right on the money! Thank you, Kelly Clark, you're the best!"
positive,"My husband and I had used another repair facility adjacent to.AAA, for 15 years, for all our car care needs. After increasing labor charges and too many mistakes we decided to try AAA. We have never regretted the switch! We just had major (over $7800) work done on a 2000 vehicle and all-encompassing services were nothing short of stellar! David B. advised us along the way of every issue, kept us up to date on the work, worked within our budget and came in before the promise date. When your car is like your child you need to have total trust and faith in the people taking care of her. We do with this garage. From the service advisors to mechanics to courtesy drivers, this AAA garage exemplifies what any repair shop should be-a place of excellence.  Oh, and by the way... I had taken my car to (sounds like Spank Mo) to check my transmission. They of all people should know this part of the car, right? Wrong! They told me I needed a total rebuild to the tune of over $3800. AAA found it was only the speed sensors which was picked up by good old-fashioned computer codes.  $500.00 of the bill above was for this repair. Transmission is good as gold.
After the work,  David reviewed all warranties, when to come back for rechecks etc and it was extensively road-tested before it was returned to me. She drives fabulously!
The garage is clean, waiting area spacious, is near Starbucks and some local eateries, they have very friendly shuttle service, and there is a discount on labor costs for AAA members. 
Thanks to this garage I have my baby back and I have a trusted garage I can rely on without any BS. Love you, David!!"
positive,"Good, reliable, trustworthy, and cheap mechanics are hard to find. Heck, finding a mechanic that just fits one of the aforementioned categories is hard to find! 

Well, hidden away on Scranton Road on the western edge of Tremont, there's a little shop that fits within all of the categories in spades.

My wife has a 2003 Acura. Our check engine light went on, so we headed off to AutoZone to have them scan the codes and see what was up. Based on what was written in the owner's manual, we thought it may have been the transmission. I was afraid that the transmission needed to be replaced (ouch!) but since it had just been replaced in 2009, there was no way that was what was wrong. AutoZone said the spark plugs just needed to be replaced (whew!), and when we asked for a good local mechanic, they recommended Tu Casa. 

I didn't know what to expect, but when they checked out our car and told us that we could save money if we went and picked up the parts ourselves, I was sold. Many places will jack up the prices on parts to make a profit, and for them to suggest that we could save money by buying our own parts was a great sign of honesty in my opinion. A return trip to AutoZone saved us some cash, and an hour or so later, we had new plugs. They discovered that an ignition coil needed to be replaced too, so we told them we'd be back. When we asked for a labor quote on that, he told us that there'd be no charge since it only takes 5 minutes to replace, and it did.

I'm beyond pleased with our experience here--the labor prices were reasonable, the service was fast, and best of all, I don't feel ripped off. I'm never excited about having to visit a mechanic, but at least I know that the next time I need car repair done, I'll be taking my car to a good place and I won't be getting fleeced."
positive,"Unbelievably well run shop. They take SUCH great care of their customers. They get me in quickly, and out quickly and always leave me with excellent work and a CLEAN car when I drive out. 

I never stick around while they are servicing my car because I need to get back to work; but they make it hard to leave. There is abundant GOOD food, coffee, beverages, comfortable seating, televisions, an enclosed play area for children with great games and movies.

Who wants to waste time getting their car repaired? pretty much no one, but Earnhardt takes the sting out of the time investment with the great atmosphere and top notch customer service.
Thanks, Norm!!! You did it again!"
positive,Shawn in the service department was extremely helpful! I had a very weird issue with my Murano on a recent road trip and found out I need a new transmission :/ ! Nissan replaced it and gave me a rental car for a couple days! Happy with my experience there!
positive,A repair shop to trust and what could be better than that.  I took my car in with a difficult to determine problem.  My dealer told me it was a transmission fix for more than $1900.  Buddys was recommended by a friend.  They were honest and fair with a quick computer diagnosis and I was out the door for 100 bucks and extremely relieved that I found a trustworthy repair shop.
positive,"I had a check engine light come on, I have to tell you from the time I got someone on the phone I felt a relief EACH AND EVERY EMPLOYEE WAS JUST WONDERFUL. I will NEVER visit or recommend any other shop than this one. You guys rock!"
positive,My check engine light had come in on my car. Firestone said it was going to cost about $300 to do a complete diagnostic on it.  A friend told me about Ron's.  Got it checked and the problem fixed for less than what the diagnostic would have cost me at Firestone.  Great service.
positive,"Great customer service...Thought my tailpipe/muffler was bent because it was off the hanger due to backing into a rock. Took it in an the manager/worker put it on the lift, put the tailpipe back on the hanger and it wasn't bent as bad as I thought....Manager didn't charge me a dime. Next time I need work done, that's the place to go. Thanks"
positive,"Fantastic work done on my Honda Civic. I went in for a transmission fluid change, they took care of me fast and paid a super reasonable price. Highly recommended."
positive,"I have been there twice. The first time,  I got my car repaired after seating in my garage for almost 5 years. Everything was rightly done to my car, and prices were fair and very reasonable -for having original parts being installed to my car. The second time, I went to do minor interior repairs, and again, I found that prices for parts and labor were very reasonable for a Volkswagen dealership. I have to note too that I received knowledgeable and professional service from Tom Radtke, that I found their facilities very comfortable while I waited, and that I received my car in the time promised, and paid very close to the original quote agreed upon. Remember, this car was almost abandoned for five years, so, few things came up on the road to have it back to drivable conditions once again."
positive,"Often, it's as though most service relationships are adversarial...you vs them, as though there must be a winner and a loser.  It's uncommon to come across a business that treats you fairly and genuinely cares about your experience throughout the business interaction.  What is even more exceptional is finding a business that is able to leave an impression on you not just once, but one that consistently exceeds your expectations.  We discovered Stamps when my wife's car was in need of tires.  Our first experience brought us back, and every experience since has reaffirmed my opinion that Tim and his team are truly a rare find in the service industry.  
    Most recently, I brought my F250 in for servicing.  Of course, it was a weekday morning, trying to get kids to school before heading to work, and the truck won't start.  Based on the input of a roadside assistance team, I was expecting to walk out with two new batteries and at least one, if not two alternators (dual alternator vehicle), and a hefty unexpected bill.  Once the roadside assistance team got me running, I immediately called Tim and explained the situation.  Tim, understanding my need to find a solution before it was time to pick up kids, worked with his schedule and told me that if I came right in, he'd have me ready by that afternoon.  When I dropped off the truck, Tim had me in and out, he even drove me back to the house so that I could make arrangements to get to work as quickly as possible.  Around lunch Tim called me to let me know that he had checked the entire system (batteries, alternators, starter, wiring, etc) and the good news was that everything checked out except the batteries.  Regarding the batteries, I asked his opinion on several brands I'd researched, including some of the top-tier batteries on the market.  Tim had every opportunity to up-sell me but that's not how Stamps does business.  Instead, he considered my typical vehicle use, and recommended a set of batteries that should last me much longer without breaking the bank.  When I picked up the truck that afternoon, Tim was again there to meet me.  He explained exactly how they tested the system, what they found, and asked if I had questions....what you typically expect from a good service provider.  Tim then told me to check-in with him and let him know if I saw anything out of the ordinary.  He specifically told me what conditions to be aware of that might be indicative of another issue and reiterated to call him if there were any other difficulties.  This is what, in my opinion, makes Stamps a great service provider.  
   As I was getting ready to leave, Tim understood that this was an unanticipated expense and let me know that he was going to help me out on the final invoice.  He applied a generous discount and wished me a Happy Thanksgiving.  I walked out feeling as though I had someone looking out for my interests and I hope the Stamps team takes pride in knowing that they have absolutely earned my loyalty...a win-win situation, which should be the goal of any service provider."
positive,"I called Dan with a question concerning my 1970 C6 transmission. He took the time to research online and gave me my answer, knowing that my project is in Idaho."
positive,"I reached out to Joe a month before I wanted my exhaust put on. He was helpful, made some suggestions, then made the appointment. When the day came to get the work done, it was done prompt and the quality was great. Joe made sure that I was happy with everything prior to my leaving town. 

I will go to the shop should I need anything with my muffler in the future."
positive,"This review is for the service department. I brought my car here yesterday to have some warranty work done on my transmission. I called ahead for an appointment and Dave Burkhardt was able to set me up for that afternoon to assess the work that needed to be done. Dave explained that the actual repairs could take a few days, which I was prepared for. 

When I arrived for my appointment, Dave greeted me and checked me in quickly. I only had to wait 30 minutes for them to assess the issue and give me an update which I thought was fantastic! Parts had to be ordered. Dave explained it could take a week to arrive due to demand. I asked if it was ok to drive and Dave set my mind at ease and explained that I couldn't hurt it by driving which was a relief. 

Overall I had a very pleasant experience."
positive,"When I first moved to AZ from MN I had a check engine light on my VW Jetta.  Finding out I would fail my emissions test with that might on I took it to Tech 1 Auto.  In MN, I had taken it to two different car repair shops as well as 2 VW dealerships--no one could figure it out!  Tech 1 Auto fixed it! Great customer service! 

Had a bad battery recently, so I took it back to Tech 1 Auto.  Another very good experience.  Fred is a great guy, always feel I can trust this place!"
positive,These guys know exhausts. I needed to get my car modified with straight pipes and get the resonators cut. Performance muffler did it no problem. It was quick. In and out in like 20 mins. I actually called around to get some price quotes and this shop has the cheapest one. First time to get my car serviced here and they left a good impression no doubt. Highly recommended.
positive,"Let me start by saying that I grew up with a father who was a mechanic, and now that he is retired I have had to find other mechanics for my car needs.  I was getting an oil change and the young man asked me if I knew why my engine light was on, and I said that it was my transmission and I was scheduled to take her in to Aamco the following day.....he said nooooooo, don't take your car there unless you want to pay an arm & leg!  He referred me to All-Pro Transmission where he had his transmission worked recently and loved the work he had done and the customer service.  I called All-Pro and this very friendly man named Jim answered....I let him know my situation and he put me at ease by telling me that he wouldn't charge me a penny to look into the issue and I was surprised since Aamco was gong to charge me over $400 just to look into the transmission.  I got a rebuilt transmission within 4 days and I can't express the communication from Jim the owner was the best I've ever had from any company.  He called me every day to let me know how things were going and I didn't even have to call them once!  I truly believe that this company is like a hidden treasure.....some of the best places are hard to find, but when you find them...you want to share the news with everyone!"
positive,"Earns five stars because, 1) speed: they rebuilt my dead transmission in less than 24 hours, 2) honesty: saved me $900 by checking the TCM (Transmission Control Module) and noticing it was still in good condition before replacing it and 3) reliability; giving their work a two year, 24,000 mile warranty and 4) more honesty: letting me know up front what their estimate included.  The work is done in-house by a tight knit crew of experts.  Go here!"
positive,I called Shane Whitted and told him I had a potential seal leak in either transmission or axle.  He said bring it in to check and they found it was an axle seal leak that Shane said was covered under warranty. We found a time I could come back for service and he arranged a loaner car while my car was fixed.  Great service and having the loaner car was key to great satisfaction while my car was repaired. Thanks Shane and the Findlay team.
positive,"My car broke done at state line and I had to have it towed to Tony's. I couldn't have asked for a better place to have my car repaired. Tony and his staff, especially Jennifer, were courteous, efficient and quickly repaired my car. Their customer service was excellent, they called me to tell me what was wrong and 3 hours later the car was ready. The cost for repair was very reasonable.My car drives better than ever. I would highly recommend Tony's to anyone in need of repairs. Thank you Tony and staff, Chris"
positive,Just had some work done for my transmission which went defective after so many complaints to the dealer about it. The car was slamming a lot and turned out the transmission was bad. Worked with Brian and Trinity from Phoenix Bimmer and was able to get a new one on my extended warranty. I gotta say I love these ppl they are very professional and communicated with me every step of the way. Brian did a great job and my car feels like new again. No more slamming. Forget the dealership I'm glad I found these guys.
positive,Came in to do a simple muffler delete on my Mercedes. Quality welding and they price reasonably for the job. Highly recommend them!
positive,"I had a phenomenal experience with E & N Auto and Accessories! I took my van to Nathan, told him the symptoms, and he started right away with determining the problem and viable solutions. I felt valued as a customer knowing that my input was considered in determining the problem. Additionally, I appreciated being informed of every step in the process in a timely manner. I had my vehicle towed in on Thursday, and the work was completed by Friday. Not only was the work and customer service high-quality, Nathan exceeded my expectations by vacuuming my van and addressing an issue with my check engine light. If you want reasonable labor and parts with a company you can trust, put your faith-and vehicle-in the hands of E & N. They will not steer you wrong."
positive,"Recently had my older vehicle into the Wilson-Niblett repair centre for an oil change and diagnosis of some transmission noise. I was able to drop in with no appointment and they found a space for me right away. Debbie Oliver greeted me promptly and listened to my concerns and gave me a solid timeline. The oil change was done on schedule and she ensured very discount available was applied. When the diagnosis became more complicated, she insured I had a loaner car so I could continue with my day. Due poor weather conditions the technicians could not properly diagnose the problem as a test drive was needed and the slippery conditions would hide possible problems. Rather than proceed with unnecessary repairs and saving me money, the technician and Debbie recommended a return on another day to ensure a proper diagnosis was completed.
I returned a week later and Debbie was ready for me with a loaner car waiting. I left my vehicle overnight and once again the repair schedule that Debbie promised was adhered to with every discount available applied. Though Debbie was not working on the day I picked up my vehicle, she still ensured that I was taken care of. Todd Delmore was there bright and early at 7:30am on a Saturday with all my paperwork ready and the car prepared to drive away. 
Overall, the service I received from all the staff including Todd, the technician, but especially Debbie Oliver, was outstanding. I was never left uninformed, all schedules were strictly adhered to, and I was provided with alternate transportation both times insuring as little inconvenience as possible. While I may have saved a dollar or two by shopping around, I highly doubt I would ever have received anything close to the level of service that Debbie and the rest of the staff provided. Well done Debbie and Wilson-Niblett."
positive,My family and I were on our way to Vegas when our engine mounts broke. Mark at Major Auto Service helped right away to get the car repaired quickly and at a great price. He got us back on the road and in great shape! A great repair shop in Vegas at great prices!!
positive,"I went here to get my serpentine belt replaced and a transmission flushed and these guys were friendly and efficient.  They took the time to explain things to me and I felt comfortable that they were making the appropriate recommendations without trying to charge me for things I didn't need.  It was ready in just a few hours as promised so I was able to pick it up same day.  Only complaint is that they left my transmission fluid dipstick out of place under the hood so it was just laying on top, but fortunately it didn't fall down and screw up anything since it was laying flat on the top, but if it had that could've been a more serious problem.  So I subtracted a star for that since it seemed a bit careless."
positive,"Went in to get a oil change and transmission I had coupons and saved a couple hundred I'm sure. The assistant manager Tim I think was thorough and helpful when some places want to get you in and out I've never had someone lift my car and show me with my own eyes the issues I had going on I'm not trusting of allot of these places, but that showed me my issues were real and honest. Definitely recommend."
positive,"I was driving a used car (new to me) from Palm Springs to Denver. The check engine light came on before Vegas. I thought ""oh s@$&"". Brought it into Tony's and immediately I knew I was at the right place. They gave me an honest assessment of the diagnostic report, and though there was potential for a bigger problem they were able to assure me that I'd be fine all the way through the mountains. Saved me from all that stress that I was so worked up about. I felt like family at this place and I'm sure you will too!"
positive,"Update :  Jeremy the manager called and offered to do the remaining repairs for free. I appreciate their effort to correct this. Thanks Sun Devil.

*While I appreciate the quick and friendly service I always get from Sun Devil, my last experience was not so good. I brought my car in because I had a check engine light going on and off and the car was running rough. I was told new spark plugs and a fuel system treatment would fix it. I paid the $650 for the repair and went on my way. The next day my engine light came on and the same problem persisted. I brought it back in and they explained that now I needed oxygen sensors and that it would be another $700. I do not know if my car needed the prior repairs but something is wrong and maybe they didn't diagnose it correctly."
positive,"This review is long overdue. I had worked many years for a competitor. However, I left I wanted to purchase a fun and dependable car so I purchased a new 2009 SCION xB from Earnhardt with assistance from accessories Subject Matter Expert with Gary Childress. My plan was to gift my son slightly used xB when he received his DL within two years. Much to my dismay my son although very athletic and master dance moves crank dat Lion King/Superman etc., however could NOT master manual transmission (new clutch installed during lessons). 

My (LOL) xB now has over 189K miles with numerous trips to Tucson (work 5 days a week for 8 months), Disneyland, San Diego and my hometown of Seattle it has never failed due to Vanessa Villalobos the BEST Service Advisor in the world. Whenever I've had an issue she has solution with the usual GREAT price and service. I will continue going to Earnhardt until the death of my xB. 

And they offer free shuttle service in addition to free coffee, water, POPCORN, and donuts while you wait. Can't beat that with a baseball bat,"
positive,"I own two 2012 Sorentos and recently had the transmission fluid replaced on both. I waited on-site for the work to be completed while enjoying fresh coffee (at 2:30pm, very nice). Jose, my service advisor, was professional and did not push additional parts or services. Very nice. 

I used discount coupons to offset the BS 10% ""shop supplies"" charges most shops like to tack on to the bill these days to mask the real cost of the service you authorize. Get on their mail/email list to receive coupons. If it wasn't for the shop supplies charge, I would have awarded 5 stars."
positive,"This was my first time using 5 Star Auto and they now have a new customer.  Not only did they treat me right, they took care of my truck which I had to bring back a few times for a mischievous vacuum leak.  They charged me for the 1st fix and then after having another check engine light come on, they diagnosed and fixed without adding to my charges.   They got the tenacious issue fixed even though due to my schedule- months later, they still honored the fix and made sure they got it right!  

Some things are not so cut and dry and instead of going all in and charging a huge repair..they started with the little things that could have been causing the issue, or were in fact causing a portion of the issue.  Along the way, another issue came about and they repaired that as well and not once did I feel nervous about having my truck there or how I would be taken care of.

Bobby was great and is VERY knowledgeable about what he does and his staff is as well.  Mike at the front was on point and I always felt that no matter what, the issue would be fixed.  

This was my first time at 5 Star which came highly recommended by friends on Facebook and I felt like a long time customer and part of the family so to speak.  

They know what they're doing their, they think outside the box and with respect to my old truck (98 Ford Expedition), they fixed the issue but never pressured me for a major fix that would out cost the value of the truck.  They do smart and good business there and they now have a new customer.

I live in Henderson, not close to them at all but because they do good biz, I'll be returning for my future repair needs.

Thanks Bobby and Mikey!  5 Star Auto is deserving of 5 Stars!"
positive,"Great Service!!!
We took our '94 Cadillac here on the recommendation of a friend.  We had tried to get our car repaired at Ted Wiens Firestone on Rainbow twice without success and at the cost of over $500.  When we took it into 5 Star Auto Repair,  Bobby diagnosed the problem within 2 minutes.  He had to have a hose assembly made special to replace the old one that had a huge tear in it (they must have blind mechanics at Ted Wiens).  We took it back in when the part came in and Bobby had it fixed in no time at a reasonable price and we were treated with respect.  Wish we had known about 5 Star Auto Repair earlier.  We are thankful to have finally found a business we can feel safe taking our cars to for repair.  Thanks Bobby!"
positive,"I purchased new tires and brakes from this location 17 years ago, and now that I'm living in the area again, they were my first go to.
I called and spoke with James on the phone. He was very kind and personable and took the time to look up my vehicle's requirements and provided me quotes and all of the information necessary regarding the warranties. Often when I call auto shops the individuals on the phone are not personable and act like I'm bothering them. This is not what I got from James.
When I arrived Gina helped me out. She was very fun and polite and we had some good conversations. She really took the time to talk with me and made me feel like I could really trust Big O. 
I ended up getting new tires, a warranty, alignment plan, and they flushed the brakes and transmission. The vehicle is 6 years old, so it wasn't shocking that this needed to be done. She kept me up to date on the status of my car and called me when it was ready.
I felt the pricing was fair. I can't say anything bad about the experience."
positive,"I needed an oil change and general safety inspection, but I was having trouble finding a place with decent reviews that took appointments and had weekend hours. I called this AAMCO and the guy said that they usually only do transmission work on the weekend, so their mechanics/general tech guys aren't in. However, he offered to schedule me for a Saturday morning appointment as he was going to be in that weekend anyway. I was happy to accept his offer and the actual appointment went very well. The man I spoke with and who worked on my car is very personable and accommodating, and the maintenance he performed on my car was done well and priced fairly. I don't know if they will always be able to accommodate my schedule, but my experience thus far is that they are at least willing to try."
positive,"Just left with a 6.2l Yukon sounding like a v8 is supposed to. Did a highway run at 75mph.  The Magnaflow they recommended put the perfect amount of growl into wide open throttle with little to no noticeable drone at low rpm in 4 or 8 cylinder mode. This is the 4th or 7th time in 20 years these guys listened to what I asked for and nailed it on the first go. 

Need muffler/exhaust work?  Go here everytime."
positive,"Found about All-Tranz by word of mouth, I have been in the automotive business a long time and they have done multiple transmission's for me in a timely manner at a fair price!  Sully and Joe do a nice job."
positive,"Twice these guys have helped us with great customer service. We blew our transmission and while they couldn't rebuild a transmission on a Suzuki, they knew who could and got us in right away. Fixed at a fair price. The second time we had a muffler issue. We dropped in, they took it into the shop and had it fixed in 45 minutes at an extremely fair price. We will always use them from now on.  Great service and very knowledgeable."
positive,"I was very pleased with my service this time. This particular Wilhelm Garage has a new manager (as far as I can tell). Chris has moved to corporate, and while I liked him and thought he was a good guy, there's no doubt that we had a few issues with Wilhelm's service when he was there, and after the last debacle with our overheating issue, we considered not returning. However, since that time I have taken this particular vehicle back a few times, and each experience has been positive. We had Wilhelm take the wheel locks off the car, and while doing so, they broke the cap on the rim. They could have easily failed to inform us, but they took responsibility and ordered a new cap. Chris was also very helpful in referring us to someone who could do transmission work that they couldn't do at the shop. Our last visit was just as positive. We had a leak in the transmission, and it was a seal that Wilhelms could fix. I was very grateful for the quick service and reasonable price--two luxuries not often experienced while servicing a car in general. Most important, however, is that while I was waiting for the car, some apparent ""big whigs"" in the company visited the store and were talking to the new manager (can't recall his name). I overheard him say that he isn't in business to gouge his customers...that he is just trying to make a living and provide his customers with the best service possible at the best price. I have to say, I didn't think anyone in the auto repair industry possessed that degree of integrity. My experience has ALWAYS been being gouged and taken advantage of. That comment from him alone will ensure that I continue taking my vehicle to Wilhelms for the foreseeable future."
positive,"I have a 25 year old car I love.  In fact, prior to writing this review I was filling out the forms to get my classic plates!

After a bad experience with what used to be a good mechanic I took my car in for Chris to check out.  It was refreshing to have someone immediately know what I was talking about not just blow smoke up my skirt. 

One of the repairs was major and since I have owned this vehicle for a couple of decades, I knew what was wrong with rear suspension and how much it would cost. The other issue really just proved how bad the last mechanics were because what should have been done in a major tune up hadn't been done.

To cut to the chase I dropped bank but I'm OK with that.  It was still a lot less than what the dealer would have charged me and I got a couple things fixed that the dealer wouldn't do anyway... including a paint to match passenger side mirror where I broke off the outer portion of it years ago and replacing the automatic lock on the passenger side. 

I still have the issue with the brakes being grabby but forgot to ask Chris to look at them.  (FYI: I went to Palladin because I dropped bank for new tires and brakes at another place and the car went in working fine and came out with alleged transmission problems.  Old brakes, find.  New brakes super grabby and the place blamed it on the transmission.  Funny how I didn't have an alleged transmission problem when I brought the car in.  That's almost as funny as the dealer telling me I needed a new ""U-Joint"" when I actually had a bubble in a front tire that was causing the car to wobble!)"
positive,"While in Vegas I contacted Tony's and went there to have my check engine light diagnosed. Fast, no bs, straight talk, took a look, concluded I was good to go, and didn't charge me when they could have...guess who is in my cellphone now when I or a friend needs a mechanic in Vegas?"
positive,"Frick Park Automotive has some mixed reviews floating around. But because they're conveniently located for me (and because some of their negative reviews had nothing to do with their service), I decided to give them a shot.  I've taken my car there three times now, all for routine service.

First, I simply needed to have a flat fixed in January. They turned it around quickly. When I went to pick it up, the owner simply handed me the keys and said ""Have a nice day."" ""What do I owe you?"" ""Don't worry about it."" True, for these folks fixing a flat is a simple task, but I expected to pay a few bucks, as is common. 

Purely based on that gesture and my interactions with the owner (and knowing how much I hate taking the car to the dealership), I went to FPA for my inspection and oil change. There was no hassle, no hidden fees, no pressure to purchase unnecessary parts or services. Solid.

Shortly after my inspection, my windshield cracked nearly the whole way across thanks to a rock being kicked up on the highway. After having it replaced elsewhere, I had to go back to FPA to get the stickers replaced. Again, simple, friendly, no hassle.

The folks at FPA quickly earned my trust. Not only are they more convenient and less of a hassle than the dealership, their prices are reasonable, and I'd much rather support a local business than a corporate one. So far, I've nothing but good experiences with Frick Park Automotive."
positive,"Best service knowledge ever. Would recommend this above all auto shops. Just walked in Waited under an hour to fix check engine light, they ordered the parts and had them there within 24 hours fixed and gone no issues customer service at top quality. This place goes the extra mile to help find what is the problem with the car , without a sales pitch. By far the best recommend to all anthem and 7 hills residents. Go Mike you rock."
positive,"Masterworks is awesome! Extremely honest, Boruch and the guys do great work and are trustworthy. Ive had work done at Masterworks in the past. I recently had to take my car to their shop for a check engine light. They took a look at it, spent considerable time coming up with a plan that made sense for me. They didn't charge me a diagnostic fee, even when I ultimately did not get the work done due to personal reasons. My go-to mechanic in Cleveland!"
positive,"On July 7th of 2016, I had just moved to Las Vegas and was in the search of a better life for my 3 children, 10, 9 and 7, and I. We were living in Montana without a lot of opportunity to have a better life. I was in search of a home, and my children were staying with my mother in Montana until I had everything figured out. I was driving a 2003 Mitsubishi eclipse and decided that it wasn't the best vehicle for 3 kids, especially with the crazy drivers in Las Vegas, so I went to DRIVETIME. I knew I didn't have the best credit due to the situation with their father 5 years prior and I was working 3 jobs so I didn't have a lot of time to truly shop around. I came across this 2012 Hyundai Sonata and just fell in love with it. THAT WAS THE CAR FOR ME. I talked with Detroy Love and the paperwork was signed. I got all the coverage they offered thinking that I would be covered if anything should happen, that was the whole reason for getting a new car from a dealership anyway.

Within the first 5 days of the sale, I took the car down to one of their approved specialist. A Midas company located on Maryland Blvd. I noticed some hesitation when Idling, almost like a faint purr vibration. I talked with the guys at Midas and they told me the car was in perfect condition but if anything did happen, in the notes there would be in writing the vibration when idling so they could go back to it if needed. Cool I could deal with that, I got the warranty anyway and if there was an issue, at least it was documented.

I found a house and my kids were brought down from Montana from the help of my dad on August 4. We finally had the space we needed, and car big enough and my family was back together and we were doing better than ever. I was elated. This was everything I was working so hard for, little that I knew it would be short lived. On August 13th my check engine light came on. I called Averex and told them hey, yo, I've had the car for just over a month and the check engine light is on. They told me to take it down to American Auto and Tire, one of their approved specialist. They ran the diagnosis and came up with an error code P2191. This error code could have been anything from electrical, to fuel to anything. They told me that they needed at least a day to go through the vehicle to diagnosis it specifically.

I didn't have the availability to just leave my car and still be able to get to all my jobs and take care of my kids, so I called Averex to see if a rental vehicle could be provided under warranty. They told me I was more than welcome to get a rental vehicle but they would not provide it for me. If it was approved, I would be reimbursed accordingly. Well first of all, you can only get a rental car if you have a credit card, and I did not. I've never had a credit card and never even thought of applying for one with my credit being the way it is (the reason I went to DRIVETIME in the first place). Second of all, I could not afford to rent a vehicle and have it reimbursed whenever. Hey yo guys, single mom, 3 kids, all starting school, new house, new city, and doing it all myself, above anything I had done before, budgeting on the high side to make sure that the kids are in a safe area and in good school district, we're not on state aid in ANY WAY and not even child support from the kid's dad who started over, never looked back, and working under the table. I just couldn't take on more than I already was.

Well I ended up just hoping nothing would happen, that it could be fixed before the kids and I ended up stranded somewhere. About a week later, I was filling up gas and for some reason when I got in the car the check engine light was off. So I again was hopeful and thought it could have just been the gas cap, knowing they need a check engine light to run the gadget again anyway I just hoped I would be in a better situation when the light came back on.

On October 31st, My little sister came down to Vegas to help me. Things were hectic and I hadn't found a steady babysitter yet being new to the area and not knowing many people. That Friday, November 4th, the car hesitated starting as I was coming home from work. I came straight home and parked it. The next morning as I was getting ready to head to the store, the car wouldn't start at all. I tried to call Averex but they only are open Monday- Friday 8-5pm. I then proceeded to call DRIVETIME and talk to Detroy, who sold me the car and told him the situation, and then talked to about 3 different managers that said there was nothing they could do and to call Averex first thing Monday morning. Thankfully I got a hold of one of my co workers who was able to get me to and from work until then.

First thing Monday morning I called Averex and got the car towed to American Auto and Tire, and it was ready by Wednesday morning, I woke up around 7 and started walking to pick up the car, it took me 2 hours to get there from my house, but being as I am from Montana I have never taken a b"
positive,Nick and the rest of the group are amazing! Last time I got my car repaired they came back with a quote 1/3 of anyone else and when I went to pay  it was even cheaper than that.  As a female I usually get screwed with car stuff but not these guys! Recommend to everyone!
positive,"After being ripped off by a previous person (not from this company) to fix what I was 99.9% sure was wrong...Sun devil auto saved my sanity and car! I realize I am a female in a mans world walking into an auto place but I grew up around men who worked on cars. I don't know it all but I sure know enough! My car would loose power and make a rattling noise when I would try to speed up fairly fast or just enough to get up to speed on a highway. My check engine light was on which gave a misfire and catalytic converter code. Apparently the other guy said it was my spark plugs. Ok, that's fair because I hadn't changed them in 4-5 yrs. same problem happened a day later! Go back...mass airflow thing. Hmmmm ok. Changed that and a day later same issue. So you can imagine my frustration which I tried to contain walking into this company. I'm human though so I'm sure some of it spilled on them when I first arrived. Sorry if it did :-/ I was done being told guesses and my money being spent with no results. I was firm when I walked in here and explained why. The front desk guy (can't remember his name sorry but he has brown hair/beard w/glasses) and Bob were EXTREMELY patient with me and professional. I appreciated them being confident that they could fix the problem with no charges that weren't needed. It was the very thing I was 99.9% sure of. These guys found it and fixed it all in the same day!!! Bob also confirmed that if I drove off and had the issue again I could come back for no charge! The car has been running beautifully and I choose to be so happy with this company. I work across the street and bragged about my experience."
positive,"They don't just supply tires they handle all auto repairs.  They  repaired my transmission and replaced the air conditioner compressor for me.  They were very fast, fair priced, and very nice.  I like George he's a good guy.
I should have taken my car to him long before now.
You'd like George."
positive,"We have been Jiffy Lube customers for 15 years.  They are quick, convenient and they do a great job.  Why mess with a good thing, right?  Recently, we had some difficulty with our Suburban.  We thought it was just electrical problems relating to our 4x4 switch.  When we took it to our mechanic they said there could be a possibility that our transfer casing was tampered with.  There are only two shops that touch our cars: Jiffy Lube and Gruelichs.  We called Jiffy Lube and spoke to the manager on duty, Gus.  He was very open to listen and actually came over to the mechanics to inspect the vehicle.  Gus notified his supervisor and sent us to the Jiffy Lube Customer Service representative, as per their policy.  We thought we were going to get the run around.  Mind you, it was during 4th of July holiday, so it did take some time.  We eventually were contacted by the rep who was going to send out the District Service Manager to OUR mechanic to inspect the problem with us!  They did not try to attempt to deny responsibility.  They, in our eyes, were taking as many steps as they could towards accountability.  Just to be sure that there was no bias, Gruelichs asked a third party to open the transfer casing and inspect it.  If it was tampered with we would know immediately.  This morning, we all stood around at State to State transmissions as they opened the casing.  What we found was that JIFFY LUBE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE!  It showed normal wear and tear.  As hard as it was for us to swallow that we would have to pay for what is a common repair to older GM 4x4 vehicles, we were glad that the establishment that we had trusted for 15 years with our three vehicles was still reputable in our eyes.  They did everything right.  From the local manager, Gus, to Judy the Customer Service rep, to Darren the District Service Manager, they all listened to the customer.  They came to us, even with the possibility they may have to pay the bill.  They were kind and considerate.  I have to say thank you to Jiffy Lube for not dismissing us.  Thank you for years of good service to our vehicles and our family.  Thank you for putting the customer first.  Good job guys!"
positive,"I was a victim of a parking lot hit and run. My Ford Explorer suffered a large dent on the rear tailgate. Dave and his team were great. They gave me the number of a car rental place near his business. Once I arrived, he called to get me picked up. I was in and out for the drop off in less than 30 minutes. His team was able to get my car repaired (I needed a new tailgate) in a week. I got my car back and the work was great and the car was nice and clean. I would highly recommend."
positive,"If you need a simple exhaust or muffler fix, they got it here for cheap. For the low so to speak. If you need a repair that requires extensive labor requiring the engine to be removed or if the exhaust leak is close to the manifold, they will not be able to do it. You cannot make an appointment and need to wait in the waiting room. It reminds me of The Walking Dead. Pretty weird but life is weird."
positive,It might be the last good honest muffler shop in town.   The guys were straight forward and never trys to upsell me on anything.
positive,"Took my truck to a local Chevy dealership for a check engine light their quote for repairs was $8000. 

Not wanting to just fork over 8k I wanted a second opinion. 
I brought it to Nick at T&M, had them look it over and what a pleasant surprise $200 for repairs not the $8000 Chevy recommended . 

I have done business with T&M on numerous occasions they always do stellar work and as a female I have never felt they have ever tried to take advantage of my situation. 
Work is always done quickly and at a fair price. 

Thanks guys, keep up the great work"
positive,"Made an appointment.   Staff greeted me and was ready to work on my van.  Service was speedy.  Oil change, filter, engine flush, transmission fluid change, tires rotated, alignment - all finished within 90 minutes.  Solon did wonderful and additionally had free popcorn and free drinks.  Thanks Dan and Terrence and the tech too!"
positive,"I own an older Toyota vehicle and I needed the catalytic converter replaced in order to pass the emissions test, something that due to a new family addition, I discovered only days before my registration expired. 

I called Performance and they quoted me a replacement at just under $300 - on Toyotas such as mine the CC (as the experts call it*) is bolted on and no welding is required so it is a quick and typical job - I should have had it replaced at 150K mi, but that's the exact type of thing I don't know.

I dropped my car off that afternoon and picked it up the next morning, ready to go, with a few days left to pass the test and re-register the car - nothing special in the appearance of the shop, but these guys prioritize the customer and the work, even for a boring, non-custom, old-Toyota CC* replacement, and by the looks of the shop they do plenty of custom muffler work that I don't understand but clearly some people get very excited about. Very pleased all-around. 

*I have no idea what experts call it, I just didn't want to type 'catalytic converter' agai-- dang it now I wasted any saved space gained via that abbreviation, plus even more talking about it! So much regret."
positive,"Justin was so great! Supper knowledgeable and does not push /try to tell you your car needs any extra work!

They did FREE oil chabges for all vets on veterans day:)! 

Both me &my bf came in. His check engine light was on &they figured out that it was just because he didn't scew on the gas cap after gassing up hard enough so that was good bewa. 
I got an oil change there for a good price and they changed out my oil plug which was apparently the wrong one put on @a crappier place(i only paid $5for the new one), but its a good thing they did b4 it caused any damage:)

Great place, good service,  pleasant experience! :)"
positive,"When I was a teenager, our family took our cars to ""Nick"" the mechanic. He was in business for decades because he did good work and he was honest. These days, with most of your options being dealerships or corporate chains it seems this is becoming very hard to find. Matthews Exxon harkens back to the day when people took pride in their work and charged a fair price. Let me repeat that: the mechanics at Matthews Exxon take pride in their work. If you own a car that is out of warranty and you are looking for a mechanic that won't deceive you to steal your hard earned money, this is the place to find HONESTY. For those interested, here are a few cases:
1. I had a strange braking noise that was only there sometimes. They kept my car and used it until the noise popped up enough times to figure it out. It turned out to be a small part. If I had gone to a dealer, they would have replaced the whole brake system after bringing it in 10 times because they just don't make the effort most of the time to diagnose. They just replace things until they find the part that was bad. That's fine if you are under warranty but if not, its a horribly expensive way to fix cars. The whole thing cost less than two hundred bucks and Scott even had my car washed while he had it.
2. My truck had a check engine light come on. Scott sent it to another independent shop that had a more expensive computer system to make sure the codes he was pulling were correct. What? A shop that works with other shops to solve a problem? Incredible. Considering how hard manufacturers are working to make everything proprietary, it is great to see shops working together to make sure they do a good job.
3. I have Takata airbags and have gotten cards about the airbag recall. I had a coupon from the stealership for an oil change so I asked my teenage son to bring it there so I could finally get in writing whether or not they had a solution for the airbags (they didn't). They told him (thinking it was his truck) that he needed an oil pan gasket, transmission gasket and rear main seal ""right away before he has serious engine damage"" to the tune of $3,800. I brought it to Exxon who usually services it. They said everything was fine. Just a drip from the dipstick tube. That was two years ago. Nothing has blown up. Could he have said ""sure, I'll do it for $2,000""? Yeah, but remember that thing I said about being honest? Imagine - the dealer would have taken almost four thousand dollars from my kid because they thought they could get away with it!
4. Today, I brought my truck over to a national tire chain in Matthews with a small nail and slow leak. Right from the start, I knew they were going to try to bullsh*t me into a new tire when they made me sign off that I understand the tire might not be fixable. Instead, they said I might need FOUR new tires because they said the tire was not fixable and they could not order a matching one! I drove over to Matthews Exxon mad that I didn't go there in the first place. It took about 6 minutes and cost $16.05 with tax.

There is a reason some small shops are around forever and never need to advertise while many chains and dealers need to churn as many customers as they can because they can't keep repeat business. It's a lesson that corporate gigs in many fields just can't seem (or don't want) to learn. Thanks for taking care of my cars for many years. We appreciate you!"
positive,"Came here the other day for a check engine light and the person at the front desk named Mike fixed it for me. 

The place seemed very reliable and professional so I came back today to get a car I just purchased inspected and they explained what was wrong with my car and what my options were to fix it. The whole experience was very easy and made me feel better about driving my used car. I highly recommend going!"
positive,"Just needed to get my check engine light diagnostic and Ryan M. helped me out and helped me understand what needed to be replaced, didn't have the part in store but offered to special order it. Excellent customer service even at 1 am!"
positive,"I have not been able to find a trustworthy mechanic until I found this place! I usually come here for my oil changes but when my check engine light came on a few weeks before my registration was due and I needed a smog check, I panicked. I took it in and Joe took care of it right away. I was worried because I would have to do whatever repairs was necessary in order to pass smog.  A few hours later, they let me know that they found nothing wrong, they reset the PCM, did a drive cycle, and even took it in for a smog for me.  When I picked up my car, I had a passing smog certificate waiting for me. I didn't even ask for that.  They truly go out of their way to make your experience as pleasant as possible. They could have easily told me something was wrong and charged me a ton of money to fix  it and I would never know because my check engine light was on and I needed it fixed.  This place is honest, trustworthy, and reliable. Literally the best place ever. I would recommend it to anyone."
positive,Wow these guys are awesome! I've never had such a good experience at car places. But these guys are different. Super friendly and go out of their way to help you. Owner got me in the same day and was done the next. They did an awesome job. I will recommend to anyone that needs muffler work. Pricing is very affordable. Cant say enough good things. Thank you!
positive,"I am sorry to see some poor reviews at this location.  Chris, Mike and Sandy saved my pocket over $800.00 a few days ago.  I had been using Community Tire Pros on 32nd St. & took it in for diagnostics on check engine light.  Community Tire told me it would be 1K plus & then no guarantee it would pass emissions (due @ end of this mo).  I told them no & left.  On a whim I stopped at this location of C & R & Chris said he would diagnose @ no charge (Community chgd me 90.00 less 20.00 cpn).  They found leaky hose & gasket, fixed it all for under 300.00 & better yet told me I would pass emissions which I did today.  They will get my business in the future."
positive,"UPDATE: I've been here multiple times since and have nothing but great things to say about Joe's Auto! Great customer service and they do a great job explaining exactly what needs to be done and why.

So I had never been to this place but my dealership said I needed all this work done on my car and I was looking at getting it done someplace else that was a little less expensive.  

I called Joe's because I got a flier from them in the mail. I asked th e man who answered about pricing for a transmission flush (my dealership said I needed it at 30,000 miles). He put me on hold for a few then came back and asked how many miles my car had and for more info on the car. He looked it up and told me that I actually didn't need this service for a long time, and that the dealership was probably trying to get more $$. He told me to check the manufacturer's book but said according to them I didn't need this service until a lot later. He also gave me some great advice about what I would probably need to get done in the next year so I would be aware.

This man could have told me to come in,  done the service and taken my $, as I didn't ask if I needed it, I just asked for a price. Instead he went out of his way to not only make sure I needed it but also was honest with me that I didn't. 

It is rare to find someone in this industry that would give up money in the interest of honesty and they have just gained a loyal customer, when I actually do need service on my car :)"
positive,If your looking for a reliable transmission shop forget about all others locations busters transmissions is the only place you should take you vehicle here are some reasons 1 I you love your car and you want someone who gives a damn about your car there the guys 2 they make sure your happy with the work your car needs 3 they don't ever try to up sell you into fixing crap that's not broken 4 their mechanic is top notch he knows what he's doing and my truck for example had a leak in the transfer case in the rear of the transmission at first we thought it was the rear of the transmission it's self they said they're call me and sure enough they cleaned my entire motor and transmission and told me exactly what was wrong and what needed to be done and with no time at all my truck was done and it drove like a dream 5 and of course the most important thing to everyone they do warranty the work they do and you won't believe how fair the prices for the type of work they do and the service they provide I recommend you look no further and take you car straight to them and have them do a wonderful job and have your car or truck driving like a dream again with no worries in the world
positive,"After just 2 weeks of being in Arizona, I had another incident added to my string of bad luck. I was trying to register my car after having been pulled over and, luckily, let of with a warning, when my transmission lines blew all the way across town. I called my insurance for a tow and then a brand new Amazonian friend recommended Virginia Auto to bring my car to. I could kiss this new friend. Pascal answered when I called to let him know I was coming on a tow and he couldn't have been nicer. When I arrived, he got me checked in and offered me options to get home, since they couldn't look at my car until the next day. Luckily, though, I had a ride on the way. 

Via text the morning, he let me know what the problem was and the cost. Once I ok'd , he was on it and I had my car back at 5 pm. Not once did these guys try to upsell me on anything I didn't need or ask for. In fact, they washed my car before giving it back to me!! Who does that? These guys, apparently. 

I've never had such a good experience with a shop in the years I've owned cars. I will definitely go back to Virginia Auto if I have further issues with this or any future vehicle."
positive,"I'm their customer for almost two years - 3027 St Rose Pkwy, Henderson -(regular oil change & car maintenance service), the staff is ALWAYS so friendly, & their prices are pretty fair if not cheaper than the market actually (when I first dealt with them I used to shop around for the best price, before I decided to just call them directly if anything came up & set an appointment!) I never had a problem.
But what really made a huge impression, was when one of my friends who live in SF bought a car from here LV, he had an emergency & couldn't come to pickup his car so I offered to drive it to him to SF. The car had a break malfunction light,  some noise, plus for sure I wanted to check if it is ready for a 500 miles trip (oil, transmission oil, tires & its pressure ...etc), I called and set an appointment, and this is what happened:
- They checked all the oils & liquids in the car!
- They checked the tires & tire pressure!
- They checked the break levels!
- They did the diagnostics for the breaks light & he told me it is not an urgent thing it can safely wait till I deliver it to my friend in SF! (I'm their customer they knew it is not my car, I just told them what is going on)
- They checked the source of the noise & told me it is also safe to wait till it got delivered to my friend in SF.
Notice that for the last two he could easy tell me it is important to fix those & just charge me whatever he wants, & I would never know! but they ARE HONEST!
The surprise was after he finished, & when I gave him my CC to charge me, he told me I'm their customer & he didn't do anything really & he will not charge me anything!!!! (it took them at least 20 min to check my car!!)
I insisted to charge me at least the labor & his time, he insisted NO, because I'm their customer & this the least they can do!!! I swear I didn't know what to say!!! (I wish I know his name, despite they all are the same in the way they treat their customers)
When I told my wife back home she didn't believe there is still good people like this anymore, neither did my friend who didn't believe what happened too!
Really thank you so much guys for everything, for the warm friendly treatment, great prices, your coffee , and just everything.............."
positive,"Had to take my truck in for a transmission rebuild. Larry, who was the owner was very helpful and down to earth. They did an awesome job on my GMC Sierra and I also have a 24,000 mile warranty. Will definitely be back future fixes. Thank you guys!"
positive,"Let me start out by saying my review is all on my customer service experience at the time of my first visit. After seeing all the negative reviews, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical coming here. My husband's 2015 370z's check engine light came on so I decided to give them a try. I was disappointed to hear that one of the catalytic converters needs to be replaced and we're just outside the 80K warranty (car is at 84K) so it's going to cost just over $1400, (was sure wishing they had some sort of grace period but guess not).  I did not have time to leave our car, so my follow up appointment is this Friday. 
So let me share why I gave them 5 stars - when I called and made the appointment, I let them know I'd be coming there but will be waiting and need a place to be able to set up my laptop and work. Upon my arrival, Stu (Stewart Amrhein) greeted me, found a quiet place for me with a table & outlet for me to set up my laptop and plug in. He was very communicative and super considerate when I was on a phone call so as not to interrupt. I can't express enough how wonderful his customer service skills were - actually quite amazing and something very rare these days. I'll be returning this Friday, but this time to drop our car off for the service, *fingers crossed* it goes as well as the first customer service went and I don't have any other service surprises like some have posted."
positive,One day I intended to get a transmission fluid change. There was some miscommunication with the staff and me and it took longer than it should. A simple 2 hour or less job turned into at 5 hour job. The management listened to me and compensated with a free service. Never in my entire life have i seen ANY bussiness try to please their customers like this. I will definetly be going back.
positive,"Just left the shop and very satisfied. I was pretty worried about finding a shop that won't try to rip me off being a new resident without my soCal connections I once had.  After spending an hour calling around for pricing, I found performance muffler.  I just wanted my direct fit catalytic converters i bought from Canada installed.  I was quoted as high as $760 just for the install something that's a direct fit at some other ""reputable"" muffler shops.  I call Performance Mufflers and not only did he quote me the best price in town and he said I'll try to get you out of here as fast as I can do you spend only the low end quote.  My Infiniti was definitely a little more complex because of the tight space allowed for the mechanic to get to.  After what seems like no time compared to the task at hand, I was ready to go.  Asked me what price I quoted them and let me go with the lowest quoted price.  Amazing! Being a guy who is in the auto industry and a car enthusiast, why wouldn't I tell my friends and family to go here? Great work and even better customer service.  If you go somewhere else, you're losing out big time!"
positive,"Brian and crew were polite and went out of their way to make sure my truck got ready for emissions with a new muffler.  Second time I've been in, will go back.  Quite pleased with my experience."
positive,"BBS accredited since 2003! Great place with reasonable pricing. The labor they charged me at $80/hr which seemed fair, they explained what was wrong with the van and walked me through the repairs that were needed.  Got a transmission rebuilt with an after market transmission cooler added on to help out with my stop and go driving. They also paid for the tow to get it to them which came out to being about $70 savings.

I highly recommend this place. I will return to have a followup check."
positive,"The service here was amazing. They were super fast and very friendly. They won't charge for unnecessary work like some other mechanics or dears ships. I had a check engine light on for my airflow sensor and it was checked for free. They even showed me how to change it if I wanted to do it myself and cleaned my filter to see if the check engine light will go off. Amazing service, will come back again."
positive,"My husband had a minor accident and had to take his Xterra in for some TLC.
His family has had a great body shop in the Glendale CA area for 50 years and he knows the business and customer service very well.
He was hesitant to get his car repaired anywhere else, but since moving to Las Vegas he had to seek help locally.
When they repaired the Xterra he did not know what to expect but was completely satisfied with ABC's repair process.
They completely informed him of what to expect throughout the repair of his car and advises that he highly recommends this group if you should need auto auto body repair.
I am looking at the car myself this morning for the first time and it is pristeen and washed so beautifully!"
positive,"Gabe came out in the evening to look at our washer. It was making a weird noise. I initially thought it was a belt, but because of the age of the washer, it didn't have a belt. It was the transmission. This man ROCKS. He's easy to chat with, SUPER NICE, and very knowledgeable about appliances. Didn't try to take us, gave us a good deal on the repair, fixed it and was on his way...Thank you Gabe for fixing our problem washer. I absolutely recommend One Shot Installation for all your needs..Give them a call...We will call him again when we have another issue for sure..Thank you Gabe"
positive,"Great, honest estimate and repair. $120 while I wait, where speedy wanted $650 to replace entire muffler for a small whole in the pipe before the muffler because the stainless steel muffler was ""probably"" rusting from the inside. When pushed for a repair estimate speedy wanted $400."
positive,"UPDATE: Wilhem did call me today and went out of their way to help me and make this right! Their customer service was excellent, and I was very happy with the way things ended. Thank you Wilhelm for following through!

The car work may actually be good (that remains to be seen), but they are extremely underhanded and dishonest. I just got back from trying unsuccessfully to be reimbursed by Chevy since the work Wilhelm did on my car was under warranty, and I wasn't informed until after the fact. My check engine light had come on so I googled the nearest repair shop which happened to be Wilhelm on Indian School/Litchfield and was fooled by the reviews. They ran a diagnostic on my car and informed me it was the ""cam shaft and actuators"" and that the bill would be $738. This was the first time I had dealt with a car dealership as a single lady and maybe that played into this I don't know. I clearly  didn't know much about car repair and didn't get a second opinion- my bad!  I went to pick up my car and that is when I found out if I had taken it to the dealer it would have been covered under warranty. I was then told to go ""talk to Chevy"" as I had already paid Wilhelm. Not surprisingly Chevy told me they couldn't reimburse me as they didn't do the work, but that it WAS under warranty, and the shop ""would have definitely realized these were warrantable parts, but they chose to take advantage of me instead"". If you are looking for an honest mechanic this it NOT the place for you, and I learned a very expensive lesson!"
positive,My mother was taking an emergency trip to Flagstaff when her check engine light went on just outside of Boulder City. She pulled into the Big O Tire for some help to insure she would make the trip. And the staff went above and beyond to make sure she would be safe. Their thoughtfulness and concern for her safety went above and beyond!
positive,"Five stars and a bravo to Wolbert's! I came here for an estimate recommended by insurance and they seemed nice so I decided to have my car repaired here as well. I called and set up an appointment. When I came in to drop off, at 9am Thursday, they called the rental car place for me to pick me up. (Little story)As we waited for the rental we were surprised and amused by their electric powered train set and pond. My son dropped a couple toy cars in the pond and I went and retrieved them. Well upon doing so I brushed up on a turtle! They have 6 turtles I believe! Anyway... The next day (Friday) at 4pm we got a call that the car was done! Well the repair looks flawless and not only that, but they washed my car! And not just the outside, but the inside as well! My back window hasn't looked so clear in a long time! Very nice and friendly employees and great auto repair! Thank you Wolbert's!"
positive,"What a great help J.D was , such great customer service and great work on my car ! 10/10 recommendation . 

Took my car back to Sun auto needed some minor repairs with the transmission . What would I say , who needs a dealership when I have found friendly and trustworthy mechanics at Sun Auto . These men are servicing me in my best interest and not worried about filling their pockets ! The master mechanic Jerry was very knowledgeable about all makes and models of vehicles. Also Patrick was a pleasure to work with !"
positive,"Leo is seriously the best. He got us out of quite the pickle today.

It was our last day vacationing in Vegas when the key got stuck in my 2014 Jetta. Couldn't get the car to shut off. Shortly after, my check engine light came on, the transmission was clunking, and I couldn't accelerate past 50mph without the car buzzing and making all sorts of sounds. It looked like we were gonna break down. We knew there was no way we'd make it back to LA. I quickly searched for a mechanic nearby and all the ones in this plaza either wouldn't help us, or gave us some sort of schtick. 

On a last ditch effort, I walked in to Auto Xperts asking if there was anything they could do for us. Leo was courteous, compassionate, and willing to help. He got my car in without an appointment and they started trying to diagnose the issues within 10 minutes of me being there. He also offered us sodas, charging cables, and cut on a movie for us to watch.

He started out by giving me an estimate for the diagnostics and quickly got to work. He and his techs did not do any work without first asking my permission. Leo was honest with me when he said he could not fix the key ignition issue, which I figured. The parts would have to be ordered and he recommended I take it to my dealership to get that fixed because it is still under warranty. 

After they checked my car from top to bottom, they were able to fix my transmission issue in an hour flat and I paid a lot less than what he originally quoted me. Awesome! He then explained everything they did, bit by bit, and even explained some in-depth info on the car's internal computer codes. After a quick test drive, we were good to go, safe to make the 400 mile trip back home. 

Leo never once tried to haggle me and never talked down to me like I was stupid. He treated me and my boyfriend with respect. He runs his business with honesty and integrity, and I would recommend him to any of my friends in a heartbeat."
positive,"I did not know a lot about smogs since previous to coming here, I had never failed a smog.  So when I took my car there and before the diagnostic was done-- my car failed the smog, and I was really upset.  I had no idea that having a check engine light on was an automatic fail.  And my light was on when I smogged the car.  I was upset that the technician did not warn me so I did not waste my money and could return once the light was turned off.  So I called the manager and asked why the guy could not warn me so that I could have saved my money, and he explained that it is against the law for them to coach me.  That the DMV checks by sending people who try to break the law to ensure that the garage is compliant.  That I could call the DMV to verify this.  (And I did; it is true.) However, I explained that I did not understand this and was upset that the money for the smog was wasted when all my car needed was a $15 dollar part.  So the manager agreed that he would let me resmog my car at no extra charge once the car was repaired.  I went in resmogged my car and passed, and it was all done in under 15 minutes.  I gave this location 5 stars, because they went out of their way to make a new customer.  I appreciate that the manager allowed me to resmog my car for free due to my previous lack of knowlege of how smogs work.  I believe that 5 star businesses give you the excellent service you expect.  I believe that some businesses deserve a 6 star rating when they go above and beyond excellent service to earn your business.  So the main point of this review is this: 1) never smog your car with the check engine light on and 2) this is an excellent business with an superb manager.  I gave them 5 stars, but if Yelp allowed a 6th star for extra credit I would.  Great Job! Many thanks, Colleen"
positive,"my engine light was on in my car and someone told me it was my transmission. i looked aamco up on line and even though it was a saturday and they were closed. they let me bring my car in to check it .he told me what was wrong and when i asked if he could do it for me today he did without hesitation!!! they saved me from having to call off work for 2 days!!! very friendly!!! will definitely go to them for any more work for my car and ask for jim to do the work!!! kudos to you jim, april, and aamco!!!! def 5 stars!!! joann"
positive,My Elantra had lots of needed work and I chose Royalty. Had taken my cars there for other minor work and was happy with the service and prices. This time around I needed timing chain water pump and several seals replaced on motor and transmission. After talking to Armondo we nailed down a great price to have all the work completed. That price exceeded a savings of over 20% versus other estimates. My car is now running fine without issues. Beats buying a new car. See you soon with my van.
positive,"First of all I wanted to thank Leo for the respect and service he provided for me and my girlfriend. 

I would highly recommend all my friends, family and anyone who are traveling to Vegas with car problems to Leo. He was honest, fair, and communicated with us the entire time. Here is why:

We came in with something wrong with our transmission, it made funny sounds when we accelerated, buckled when we shifted and our check engine light came on. 

We pulled into this lot full of different types of shops. No one had time for us that day and one shop had real bad reviews. 

 We were greeted by Leo the manager himself. He listened to our situation and told us what he can do for us. Leo said he would try his best to get us back on the road. 

He gave us an estimated quote and said that it would go towards the total cost of the repairs if it came to it. He mentioned that one person was ahead of us and we would be next. Keeping us in the loop. 

Leo also said he would make sure we would know what was going on before doing anything and would want our permission FIRST.

As we waited, Leo offered us sodas, electric outlets, and turned on Amazon video while we waited. The bathroom and waiting room was clean. Leo refilled the water dispenser with bottled water.  

Leo would actually come close, literally sit down on a chair next to us and take the time to listen to us whenever we were making conversation. He always made eye contact with us and informed and explained everything to us about everything. 

We waited for a little over a hour and Leo and his team fixed our problem to where we were able to get back on the road. 

We paid in cash and Leo gave us a receipt. He even wrote down the computer codes that the car gave for our information to keep. Leo never kept anything to himself and communicated everything with us. ""A honest man has nothing to hide or be afraid of.""

His main mission was to get us back on the road and he did. The check engine light was still on but we did not have trouble with the transmission accelerating anymore. No buckling, sounds, or trouble. We could finally go back home!

Luckily our car was covered by warranty and Leo highly suggested we took it back to our dealership. He did not over charge us nor pushed us for more repairs. We could not take it to our dealership due to our time constraint, location from the nearest dealer, and us being tourist. 

Thank you Leo and his team at Auto Xperts."
positive,"The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the poor condition of the vehicle we rented. We had some mechanical problems on the road and the car itself was old and run down. However, they were great at taking care of us, making everything as easy and smooth as possible in getting the car repaired (they arranged everything, told us where to go, and paid for it over the phone). Even the repair shops mentioned how easy they were to work with.
And once we returned they refunded us a nice chunk of our rental fee, for the days lost and general inconvenience. 
We will definitely rent from them again, especially knowing that the model that gave us trouble is being phased out. 
Great concept and nice people. These vans make road tripping so easy."
positive,"Service Department:

I took my car in because the transmission had been slipping in lower gears and I was getting several warning lights on my dashboard.  Most mechanics in the area refused to even look at it, save for the overpriced transmission shops. I was a little wary of taking it to the dealership because they are known for higher labor rates and I didn't want to be solicited by salespeople.

I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only was my transmission issue a cheap fix, but they also noticed a leak in my power steering pump (once again, I was wary at first but they turned out to be right about that, too).

Elisha was extremely helpful.  I dropped off my car on a Friday morning and asked if I could receive updates during the repair.  I let Elisha know that my job is mostly over the phone, so we may have to play phone tag, but she was more than happy to text me the updates.  She also arranged a loaner car that I could drive over the weekend (which was an extremely nice late model Honda CRV).

All in all, it was more expensive than going to a typical auto shop; but the warranties, as well as the convenience, the welcoming atmosphere and the friendliness of all employees was well worth it.

I would consider it a great experience."
positive,"I have been to many many unreliable car shops in the valley and after the reviews and how close Crawfords was to my house I thought I would try it out. I was having problems with my transmission slipping for almost a year. It was not  super noticeable to everyone, but growing up with a father who restored cars and would have me help with with transmissions I knew there was a problem. I would have shop after shop turn me away and say ""we only notice it a little"" or ""I wouldn't worry about it"". I was shocked! My transmission fluid was burnt and I was determined to get to the bottom of this. I had a warranty that other shops said wasn't good anymore...I couldn't read the paper work well and I trusted them. I was about to trade my car in and spent weekend after weekend at dealers. Something wasn't sitting right with me, so I took it here. I told them I had a warranty but wasn't sure on the status. After they did some work they called to tell me the warranty was still good! I did need a new transmission and I needed my drive train replaced. They worked with the warranty company and got me a brand spanking new Acura transmission and the warranty paid for it. I was relieved and knew that I did the right thing by taking it here for one last opinion. It ended up costing about $7,300 something. I would most definitely recommend this shop and will be taking my baby here from now on."
positive,"Great place to great your car or truck worked on. 

I was referred to Ventrice by a friend that has been taking his Lexus there for years. Rocky and his son Greg are outstanding. They specialize in Volkswagens and Audis. 

Ventrice also specializes in diesel engines, transmissions, electronics, bottom and top end engine work as well as drivetrains with VW factory certified training and knowledge. 

In addition to their foreign expertise, Ventrice also services domestic models as well, and is a licensed Pennsylvania inspection station. They even do collision and body work. 

My car needed a complete suspension over haul to pass PA inspection. (springs, upper control arms, ball joints, outer tie rods, front and rear rotors and a front and rear alignment. Greg got all of that done in less than a week! 

If you are looking for reliable, friendly, and personal service Ventrice Auto is your shop."
positive,Took my car transmission rebuilt got it back In two days  very satisfied with the work and did everything they said they would do will return for any future work thanks
positive,"I won't ever take my car anywhere else. Ever since my previous repair shop shut down I asked around with my friends and they mentioned this place. They are extremely fairly priced and won't nickel and dime you for everything. They are also the kind of shop that will tell you if something needs to be replaced that's easy (I.e. air filters) instead of trying to get you to pay a premium for them to do it. Extremely honest shop and great work done! I've gotten my transmission fluid changed, oil changed and tires rotated multiple times and the prices are great. I've also gotten my blinker bulbs replaced twice and this shop was kind enough to do it for free both times, not often that you find a shop honest enough to do that! This is truly the place to go!!"
positive,"Have gone here a few times for an oil change, today went for an oil change and a transmission fluid change.  The guys working here seem to truly enjoy their work, could hear them joking around quite a  bit, which is cool with me as long as they get the job done.  Which they did.  I think happy employees are a good thing!  They got me in and out in about 45 minutes.  I expected to be there an hour.  So that's another bonus.

The prices are a bit highish, but I know that those prices are set by corporate and they have no control over that....so it is what it is."
positive,"Excellent service! This team is amazing. I recently had an oil change completed and am very satisfied. Have done a few mods (APR stage 1, transmission, and cold air intake) for my GTI and trust this team with all my needs.  Looking forward to more and will always bring my GTI here for mods and oil changes."
positive,When my new car needed a new bumper this place was recommended by Avondal Toyota. They replaced my bumper and soon after I was in a rear end collision which brought me back to have my car repaired. The quality of work is excellent and they stand begins their work. Another incident happened when I was caught in a dust storm and my car was damaged so I took it back for the paint and repairs. I have become a frequent customer and truly do appreciate all the hard work and excellent customer service. One benefit of using this body shop is they have rental cars so you don't have to deal with another vendor to rent a car while your car is being repaired. I highly recommend this place for any body work or paint job you need for your vehicle.
positive,"Best muffler shop I've ever been to. Fast, efficient, great price. My 1967 Mustang turned out perfectly. Would highly recommend"
positive,"I'm completely shocked and amazed at the level of service that I just received at this repair shop. Our 04 Jeep Wrangler out of no where was making a lot of clanking noises and was looking what looked like to be oil or possibly transmission fluid. I'm not car saavy whatsoever so I really am at the mercy of mechanic shops when it comes to the recommendations and repairs of my car. I had to have the vehicle to one auto shop in town (Sun Auto off of Stephanie Street in Henderson) upon arriving I waited almost five hours and had to call them to find out what was going on with my Jeep. At first estimate the mechanic Vince stated that my jeep was going to need completely new brakes/rotors in the front, knuckle that holds the steering column, and a brake fluid flush. I requested to not get a flush as I heard that type of thing is completely unnecessary. He didn't like to hear that I didn't want that service and proceeded to tell me that the entire cost of the repair was going to be $667. I couldn't believe that price as I have had bad experiences at other Sun Auto locations. I reached out to my Dad who recommended Bob and Dale over at Specialized Auto Care. He mentioned that when every other shop was giving him the run around and trying to overcharge that they would always give him a straight answer with what was going on with his vehicle. I then had my car towed over to this shop and the tow truck company was over an hour late. Dale stayed an hour and 15 minutes after closing to receive my vehicle, mind you, it was the one rainy day in Vegas. lol 
The next morning at 10 am Dale gave me a ring and let me know that there were a few bolts that had been stripped and they replaced those with one other part. He let me know the noise was gone and everything was working great! Magically, the Jeep was fixed and not for $667... but it only cost less than $200!! I'm still taken aback from the amount of great customer service I have received from Specialized Auto Care (specifically Dale) and am so thankful to not have to spend any more money on a car that we have spent thousands on already. Dale, thank you! You have a longtime customer in me!"
positive,"Mark, Dale and the entire crew at ADS are true professionals. ADS is not the least expensive, in fact, I went to another shop first and had a bad experience (After interviewing multiple shops). Gregs Japanese Auto (STAY AWAY) came highly recommended, after leaving a differential plug loose (leaked fluid all over my garage) and not putting the oil cap back on (LUCKILY, found it after I saw the gear oil on the floor) and drilling a hole in the fuel filter hose (ADS discovered this), I decided NOT to go back. 
Thus, began my experience with ADS. (Found them on the internet, read good reviews.)
I purchased a used 'Seahawk Blue!' 2002 Jeep Wrangler Sport in 2011 because I do not like the crappy new JK (Dodge - BLAH!) engines and wanted to build up a trail rig for Arizona, to my specifications...
Work to date ADS has performed:
- Replaced clutch kit. (Throwout bearing, pilot bearing, resurfaced flywheel.)
- Re geared from 3:73 to 4:88 to accommodate 35"" tires. (A MAJOR job, no problems - runs great now. Mechanic told me I could 'do wheelies' now. LOL.)
- Welded in a new Flowmaster Superflow Delta 40 muffler. (Talked me out of wasting money on a catback system/new catalytic converter. Thank you, actually sounds like a V8 and gets better pick up.)
- Added an electronic locker to the rear Dana 44. Recommended NOT adding to the front 35s, added limited slip instead. (YEAH, EASY BUTTON for tough hills/ruts/rocks!)
- Diagnosed and replaced leak detection pump. (Check engine light wouldn't turn off.)
- Installed aftermarket beefed up (Rubicon Express) upper control arms, adjusted lower control arms and added upper ball joints to adjust camber for alignment.
- Fixed towing electronics Greg's jacked up.
- Installed speedometer calibrator.
- Replaced fuel filter hose. (Greg's drilled a hole into it when doing shoddy work prior.)
- Replaced rear main seal and rear pinion seal.
- Replaced oil pan gasket. 
- Replaced serpentine belt.
While the Jeep's transformation is nearly complete. (Adding body armor, new wheels/tires, lowering body lift...) my Jeep will only go to ADS from now on.
I also recommended a good friend and they fixed up his Infinity G20 - he LOVED the work.
Again, you can probably skimp and pinch pennies and go to another shop, like I did initially. But you could pay for it in shoddy labor, lack confidence on quality of work and if you are doing MAJOR upgrades/projects like re gearing and clutch work, consider ADS. I often take my Jeep off road, I do NOT want to have to worry about breaking down because of crappy work.
I recommend ADS to all my friends, I have NO affiliation with them - but have gotten to know some of the guys over the last couple years and highly recommend them. They are very knowledgeable and spent extra time going over some of my detailed questions...
I know a lot about my Jeep, and double check any recommendations.(Paranoid) In fact, the previous owner left behind paperwork I keep in a file at my house. A couple items were pointed out to her previously and there was a quote - the ADS mechanics made the same recommendations and the quote was actually less. (Consistent, honest - not really impressive they outbid a MOPAR/Jeep shop from Colorado, but honesty and consistency are worth the price.)
ADS gets a rare five stars from me, when my daily driver comes off warranty it will go to ADS too.

positive,"I've been coming here for almost two years now, I had a bad experience at the Pep Boys near by and decided to venture here. They have been doing my oil changes every time I need one, they have fixed radiator hose, and my check engine light came on and they fixed my car for $80 which was a shockingly good deal compared to other research I had looked up prior. Will be back this week for my oil change"
positive,I have been to this shop for a muffler delete and a new muffler thrown on after a month. The shop has not let me down and has done good to my BMW. Very nice seating area along with a clean shop. Will be returning in the future for my exhaust needs.
positive,"I made the mistake of trusting a friend to replace the tranny on my Chevy Silverado. He got a tranny he said was rebuilt, but we could never get the truck working with the new one. So long story short, I spent over $2,000 and a month's worth of time to try letting my friend do it. -- I'm not sure if they just felt bad for me after hearing this story, but advanced transmission gave me a better price to rebuild the tranny than my friend cost me. They finished it within 3 business days, it now works great, and I trust that they'll be there should something go wrong. Was great working with them!"
positive,"After having an issue at another Midas store and wrote a review on Google, I was immediately contacted by the owner of This Midas and was asked to bring my car to the Summerlin (W. Charleston) location to have it looked at and repaired...I went in and was met with the nicest bunch of guys! They took no time getting under the hood and realizing what the issue was and scheduling me for the next day, as they had to order the parts. The owner Bob and the manager Ronnie(sp) went above and beyond to get my car repaired properly. There were a couple of minor issues that made the job time consuming, but the guy ( didn't get his name) working on my car got it done and did a wonderful job! Left my car in great condition ( no grease or dirty hand prints or shoe marks) I will definitely make this my Midas from now on!  Thanks for everything!!! Shawn Cancelli"
positive,"I had a great experience at this location. Sandra took care of me, got an oil change, transmission fluid change, radiator flush, ac service, cabin air filer replacement and overall inspection and fluid check. All good at reasonable prices given the quick service. Even got a discounted car wash. I will be definitely coming back for oil changes."
positive,"I have been coming to this dealership for my service needs since it was located on Hayden 8 years ago.   I recommend Hyundai to all my friends and family.   The service area never does me wrong, no matter if it is for a simple oil change or a check engine light, they are all top notch.  My service advisor for years recently left and so I was recently fortune it to start working with Mike when I had to have my car towed in.   He was amazing, kept me informed on what was happening with my car, and when it would be ready.  Thank you Hyundai and everyone for taking care of me and my car.   Hyundai customer for life!"
positive,"Brought in a Toyota with damage to the muffler, exhaust tip and pipe, in four hours the pipe and exhaust tip are repaired and the muffler had no damage as I had thought. WOW. Honest, fast, economical and it looks brand new. 

Should have reviewed a couple of years ago because Performance Muffler installed a flowmaster exhaust on my 2007 Tundra and I'm really happy with that, even five years later. Can't recommend enough."
positive,"I want to personally thank Ken for helping my husband and I out today. Coulter Nissan has told us multiple times that our car needed a transmission fluid flush. He explained that since our car has a CVT transmission, that it is not necessary and could be costly. He recommended us to AAMCO to have it inspected. We took our previous Sentra here. These guys are the most amazingly honest mechanics I have ever met. We will continue to come here. Highly recommended. 5 stars all the way."
positive,"As a woman I'm always skeptical about having my car repaired, however I was referred to Certified Collision by my insurance company and was pleasantly surprised.  First, the facility looks nothing like what you would expect, it was clean and new.  The manager and staff were professional and the repair that was done looked great.  I will definitely refer this business to my friends and family."
positive,"Because of the heat, my windshield cracked. So I called clear quality auto glass and they came to my house and fixed it. My original window had window tint on it and I was worried that the new window wouldn't match my car, but it came out amazing! They did not only do great on replacing my window but the tint was incredible. It's great to be able to have both my window fixed and get my window tint installed all at once. I definitely recommend as you will not be disappointed!"
positive,"Huge mahalo to army vet Mike M. @ Mello Motive for savn my bacn after my van's rear transmission seal blew out, spun the bushing and dumped trans fluid all over I-10 on the way to Travis AFB from Texas.  He reached out to multiple contacts and found a good used tailpiece and bushing for the trans and had me back on my journey before nightfall. He even worked past closing to wash down my undercarriage and back doors/windows which were coated with leaked fluid and road grime.  What are the chances of getting that type of quality service late on a Friday afternoon!!!  On behalf of J&J Worldwide Services and Travis I commend you for your competent and determined diligence in getting my company's van repaired.  You turned my weekend nightmare into a short delay and are a true credit to the auto repair industry.  God bless!"
positive,"I have bought tires for myself and daughter, had an AC compressor installed, had a side view mirror installed, tail pipe and muffler repairs, front end alignment, bumper repair, windshield replaced and flats repaired at Marco's Detailing.  I have been treated respectfully, always charged truthfully and I trust Marko completely with my car!

positive,"When I moved to Nevada, i searched for a shop that I could trust.  Unfortunately it took me a few years before I discovered Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment Center, and I felt like I was being taken advantage of at the other places.. its been about fifteen years, and I have only taken my cars here. Pete always listens to what i have to say when I am describing the problems, and will ask questions that help him get an understanding of what I an trying to explain. I always feel like he is being truthful with me, and never like he is trying to sell me something that I don't actually need.  I take my cars here, and only here, for everything, not just alignments. Although one time I needed a muffler, and Pete referred me to his favorite muffler shop, but other than that I only go to Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment Center."
positive,"These guys are super transparent when it comes to your car.  If there is an issue, they will show you what they found: for instance, if your transmission fluid needs to be changed, they will show you what color your fluid is versus where it should be.  If your battery needs to be changed, they will show you the test they performed and what your battery measured.  

I have an older car, 85K miles plus, and these guys do keep me informed with what needs to be changed when so I know ahead of time to budget for my next visit.  Luckily I haven't had to get any major repairs done, but this place would be my first stop.  

My only issue with this place is the waiting area.  It could be spruced up a little to make it more comfortable for people waiting for their cars.  I know I'm being nit-picky but I hope the owner will read this."
positive,"So my wife recently ran into trouble with her equinox, she tells me she is going to call her friend/mechanic to have him look at it. (I was worried) Unfortunately he discovers that she needs a new transmission. Out of curiosity I called around for pricing and my God the difference was obvious. Rob was straight up no hidden fees no delays in  availability and he didn't charge her an arm nor a leg. His price was more then reasonable and he was more then honest the whole way through. This is a reliable honest mechanic more importantly trust worthy. I recommend his shop completely."
positive,"I got my truck fixed here and it came back to me looking better than ever! They did an awesome job! Eric was great and kept me informed every step of the way! If you need your car repaired come here, you wont be disappointed!"
positive,"Thanks for being honest and straightforward, guys! They actually recommended that I call the dealership to find out if a repair would be covered under the transmission warranty, before agreeing to go ahead with the repairs. Turns out it's covered, and they saved me couple hundred bucks. :):) Can't beat that service!!"
positive,"This is my second excellent experience with Muffler Masters. They put a factory style muffler back on my Ford Excursion to bring the sound level back to stock.  They gave me some great options, completed the work quickly, and the welds and alignment are perfect. Will be back for more when I need exhaust work!"
positive,"Doesn't even feel like a shop; it's more like a lounge. The staff here are super fast and honest about any issues with your car. I had my transmission flushed, brakes replaced and Busy Buggy is where I have my oil changed every few months. They truly are a quality shop and if you want your car in proper working condition, take ur to Busy Buggy (bonus, the cookies are amazing)."
positive,"If I could give them 6 stars I would! On vacation the check engine flashed on me.  Because I was driving home on a long drive I looked up mechanics on yelp and I trusted the reviews. Got there early at 7am and they took my car in. They have an awesome waiting room with arcade games and a separate room with a TV and couches. They have Wi-Fi which was great because I had to do some work on my laptop. Now as a female I'm always nervous to go to a mechanic but the service was amazing. The check engine light wasn't on when I arrived at Rebel and the car was working. They asked thoughtful questions, checked the car and test drove it twice to make sure. Because they weren't sure about what could be the problem they didn't feel comfortable taking my car apart just to charge me. Wow! Even though they weren't 100 percent sure they gave me some recommendations about what the problem could be and some estimates for when I got home. They told me that if I had the same problem on the road to try a few things. Sure enough their recommendations worked and I got home safely."
positive,"I called about an unknown problem with my daughter's car that our mechanic thought should be looked at by a transmission expert. Aaron told me to bring the car right in and it was checked out and the problem determined within an hour! We had to wait for parts that needed to be special ordered, but we were kept informed of the progress and I felt safe leaving it with them for a few days because of the secure parking area they have onsite. I will absolutely recommend this business to friends."
positive,"Super fast work, removed stock exhaust (muffler and resonators) and replaced with Magnapacks and an X pipe. My Camaro SS finally sounds like a muscle car. Also noticed improved performance because the exhaust isn't being throttled as much. Thanks!!"
positive,"Super friendly and very reasonable. Called another muffler place and they were trying to charge me double the price!  Thanks,  Joe!"
positive,"I gave them a call they gave me all the information and pricing over the phone. Their services was excellent and exceptional. I even also asked them if I could get it done as quickly as possible because I had to leave on the same day to Colorado. They were able to do it. I had ask for a transmission flush & oil change. They told me it might take two hours. So they asked me if I had anyone to take me home and I told them no I'll just take an Uber. The gentleman that was helping me order me a lyft and they paid for it. They also asked me if I need a lyft again to come pick up the car. That was so sweet of them to do. 
They email me the information about my car they did a free check up saying they couldn't do the transmission flush because they didn't have the tools to do it. I told them that was fine and understandable. They were able to do Apple Pay because I lost my credit card. I would recommend this place and will be coming back!"
positive,The reviews are right. You won't find a better muffler shop in the country let alone Las Vegas!  My truck sounds amazing!  Thanks Perfomance Muffler!!!
positive,"I am giving my experience with Josh Bash ***** because of his diligence in making sure my needs were met.I am writing today to express my appreciation for Joshua Bash and the effort he put forth in making sure my needs were met. 
My 2012 Nissan Versa was recently towed to Larry H Miller from my mechanic's shop with transmission trouble. Josh was informative and helpful from the start. He also displayed great patience and understanding when I voiced concerns or frustrations.
Josh went above and beyond my expectations as a Service Advisor. I appreciated his communication, professionalism and willingness to keep pushing for me and my situation. I am very grateful that he was able to help me get the repairs that I needed done at a price I agreed with. I went into the experience frustrated and honestly, distrustful of dealerships. I am pleased to say that this experience has definitely opened my eyes to the fact that not every experience has to be like that."
positive,"I took my Ford F150 to get a muffler installed, Joe the manager and his crew were absolutely very hospitable, professional and very good service, I highly recommend this place they're good people."
positive,As always excellent customer service experience.  Robert was wonderful today and the guys did an excellent job servicing my check engine light.
positive,"I brought my Range Rover Sport in without an appointment on Friday, March 29, 2019 around 5pm because my check engine light came on. Chris C in service went above and beyond my expectations. Long story short. It took 13 days to get my truck back(no appointment, contacting warranty company, ordering parts and lastly a road test). I was kept in the loop as to what was going on at all times. What I appreciated the most is that I was not turned away when I stopped in on a Friday evening with no appointment and given a loaner. Chris C truly exemplifies outstanding customer service."
positive,"Great customer service, Brought my Car in today to see what if they could turn the check engine light off. I had already completed the repair and did not have accept to turn off the light. After about 5 shops. Stamps did not miss a beat. Got there scanner confirmed the codes. Then erased the code and light!! Customer service is harder and harder to find these days!! Thank you Stamps for taking time out of your day to help someone out without trying to make a sale.."
positive,"In auto repair I understand they have point checks and diagnostics.  And so goes the same for customer reviews.  For a business such as auto repair, I think its fair to base the primaries on professional and friendly customer service, quality, pricing, communication, and timing.

Since we first brought our cars into a USA Auto, the customer service at both locations have been highly superb.  This location is more convenient for us and we chose to continue our service here.  It's so convenient that when Matrix died, Corolla was able to nudge it under 10 minutes to this location.  

Most previous repair services I've brought my vehicles into was the entire day's wait.  I expected to wait just as long so planned the day with errands while Matrix was being revived.  It needed an alternator, battery, and transmission service.  I was also expecting to spend almost a thousand $$$.  Far from it!  And on top of that the diagnostic cost was waived since Matrix tested ""flat line"".

We slowly booted Matrix into a parking spot roughly 10:15am on a Saturday morning.  Cody always attentive and walking out to greet while still parking in the lot.  Salena awesome at making sure of service reminders.  Matrix was ready to go home in roughly 3.5 hours.  Dave and his crew - better than excellent!  Matrix engine sounds really good for 159,000 mileage :D

Dropping our vehicles off again for upcoming oil changes.  They raised the bar, I raised a star.  Our vehicles have happily chosen their new care takers!"
positive,"The BEST place to get your car repaired!  BJ Hummel was amazing and great to work with. He kept in contact with me to keep me up to date on what was happening and also when my car was finished.  The final outcome was stunning, it did not look like it did when I brought it in, it looked brand new.   Do not hesitate to use their services!!!"
positive,"Had a check engine light, stopped in and although the shop was busy Mike was clear about the length of time things would take. Due to the vagueness of the check engine light it took quite a bit of time and attention, Mike communicated with me throughout the whole process as to where things were and how it was going. Once they figured out the problem, as with most unplanned car repairs it was more than I could really afford, with some creativity Mike was able to get an acceptable part at a great price making this repair alot easier to stomach. This vehicle is a BMW so price of parts and cost to repair are always over the top expensive. Repairs were made and my car was returned. A day later I was having a similar issue and Mike went over and above to make sure I got the car back to him ASAP. He found a small issue and remedied the problem at no charge, this was a repair that could have fallen on my shoulders but because of Mikes integrity and willingness to do what it takes to not only get a job done but make sure the customer is satisfied. If you are looking for shop I recommend this Meineke."
positive,I'm so happy I switched from San Tan Ford to Berge! I have had so many problems with my car and San Tan Ford just plain sucked! They wouldn't let me have a rental car so I sat for HOURS and waited. Today I took my car in again to have the transmission fixed. Berge fixed it the first time and in general the Focus's transmission is awful so it's not their fault. Today when I brought my car in Tim Drake helped me out and offered to get me set up with a rental car. I was shocked because no one has ever offered me that. I don't need it because I'm using my moms car. They are awesome!!!
positive,"This place was absolutely amazing and very very affordable. I have a 1995 Ford Bronco that two other shops charged me an arm and a leg for, and they still could not fix the leaking of my transmission. These guys diagnosed it for me and gave me a quote that was much less than the other guys who did not even fix it. They were done in half a day and I have not had one drip of oil or transmission fluid on my driveway since. I would recommend these people at any time and they have earned my business for life."
positive,Good price. Professional service. Appointments are carried out at appointed time. No better muffler shop in Vegas.
positive,"Normally I take my van to an area tire chain store for regular vehicle maintenance, i.e. oil changes, tire balancing,  rotation & alignment.  During my last visit, the tech mentioned that because of the age of the van (13 yrs., 108K miles & OE suspension system) that I should consider replacing the shocks and struts.  While I never experienced any excessive bouncing or handling, his comment played in the back of my mind.  Fast forward several months, I started hearing rumblings from my exhaust system.  Having had a favorable experience with Monro earlier in the year fixing the exhaust system on my Toyota, I decided to take my van into them for the muffler and have them check out the suspension system. The manager, Robert Gaiser, assured me that they found no leakage or need to replace any of the suspension parts, but that I needed a new muffler. Not only do I feel that I got a fair price on the muffler, but I felt that I was treated like a valued customer as Mr. Gaiser was very cordial as he took the time to answer all my questions. Job was completed on time as promised.  Would recommend this shop for servicing and car repairs."
positive,"I've read some negative reviews about this shop. Frankly, I'm puzzled. If you own a German Car, most people realize that owning one that is 'out-of-warranty' for a number of years after the warranty has expired; can be quite costly. For those of us who find German cars not only appealing as a means of transportation, but also; as a hobbie - we value long-lasting relationships with competent mechanics and engaged owners of independent car shops.

Short-sighted thinking that after only (1) visit - you should attempt to destroy the reputation of a well-meaning and competent group of automotive engineers just because you didn't receive what you expected - is - well - short sighted.

I have 3 BMWs that are professionally and reliably maintained by Eurowise. I've seen good and bad mechanics arrive and leave Eurowise over the last 3 years that I've done business with them. Frankly - only the good ones are left. If you value long-lasting relationships as it pertains to the cars we love and drive - then I would suggest giving these guys a 2nd and even 3rd chance. After all, a small squabble over a $100 repair bill is nothing - compared to what you'll eventually wind up paying for more significant repairs to your German car over time (like timing-chains, coolant re-seals, transmission repairs etc ...)

Not only are the technicians and management team fair in their pricing - they absolutely stand by their work - no questions asked. And they are a great group of guys on top of their game!

So from a real German car enthusiast to the rest of you - remember - don't sweat the small stuff. These guys are the real McCoy - and I wouldn't trust a dealer to look at or touch any of my vehicles ever again. Talk to Marcel or Mike. They'll make your situation right."
positive,"Price: Unbeatable 
Wait time: Substantial
Work: Not perfect, but for the price it's great. 
The shop is first come, first serve. They open on Saturday 8am-12pm. I arrived at 7:30 and was second in line. My car was not finished until 10am but the crowd in the waiting room passed the time by chatting with one another so it was a pleasant experience. I brought a cat back system and had it installed here, I also asked them to cut the mufflers out and replace them with a straight pipe. I requested that they re-use the stock exhaust hangers and weld the system (which was in pieces) together but not to modify or attach anything permanent to the car itself. The welds aren't superiorly beautiful but they're functional and neat. This shop also does exhaust repair, custom systems, muffler deletes and more."
positive,It's so hard to walk into a place for a service you know nothing about...however my experience with performance muffler was great! The staff are Very helpful and quick to get the job done! Thanks guys for taking care of me!!
positive,"Where to start?  5 STARS!  Would give 6 if I could.  Nice guy with great temperament, easy to talk to, keeps long hours (all day SAT!), knows how to fix things, prices are lower than they should be, no wait, lots of space on the lot.  Can even walk across the street for coffee.

He says he's had the franchise for about a year, so older reviews are not relevant. Very, very pleasant young man, Jon, who knows his stuff.  The older guy also inspires confidence (a we-do-it-right sort of guy).  Other customers look like good company, nice clean shop.

I've had a LOT of great mechanics over the years on Porsches, Benzes, Alfas, Acura, Mazda, Jag...).  Fully confident this Monro can take care of my current 82 Fiat, 93 Alfa, 97 Maxima, 98 Subaru, and 02 Highlander. 
I'm an engineer who likes older cars, so I have to know the good mechanics wherever I live (my last mechanics did race prep for Carroll Shelby on his Austin Healys back in the day, signed photo on the wall).  

Jon's oil change is about $20 cheaper than everyone else, with full filter change and plug-out drip-drain (no gimmicks).  He did calipers, muffler sections, O2 sensors, and differential oil changes for us that were not cheap.  I looked them up:  the internet said the cost could have been 1.5x to 2x what he charged.  This shop doesn't upsell either -- just does what's needed or what's asked for.

Final word?  I'm writing this because I'm disappointed with the guys down the road who asked $3000+ to get the Nissan back on the road (Jon just did it for $541).  Those other guys charged $250 just to look at it, said they sent a video (they didn't, and I didn't ask them to), and the kicker?  Those other guys lost the emissions paperwork I needed to register the car.  Wow.  That's the competition.  This Monro (Dover Center Road, Bay Village) is so much better.

My wife agrees, this Monro is where we'll be doing all our work now, and it's right off Lake Road, très convenient.  We've tried several other shops in the immediate area, but this is EASILY THE BEST."
positive,"Ever since I purchased my cute little red Ford Focus, I had problems with the transmission​ and went to 3 different Ford dealers to fix it. I mentioned this to @Nick Wheeler when I brought my car in for a recall, who not only knew the sound the car made when it acted up, he told me the problem was really with the clutch, and he would fix it for free, as it was under warranty​​. It took a while to get the recall parts and the clutch so Nick got me a free rental and kept me in the loop every day. When I got my car back, it was unrecognizable! It's so much FUN to drive! Lot's of pep and energy. Charges up hills like a chap. I'm just thrilled to be back in love with my car again."
positive,"Thanks for working on my car. Got an engine oil cz, engine coolant flush, and transmission flush."
positive,"I haven't even got my car back (Lexus SC400) and I'm already giving these guys 5 stars.  Instead of ""throwing parts"" at a driveline vibration they put my Lexus uup on the rack, spun the wheels and SHOWED me a U-joint problem and a problem necessitating replacement of the differential.  When I said, ""How much $ for the diagnosis"" the answer....NOTHING!  So now they're installing a replacement diffie for me, rebuilding the drive shaft, and I have no doubt the car will come back smooth and quiet.   Too bad Arrowhead Lexus simply pointed their finger at the transmission mounts as the cause of all the problems."
positive,"I highly recommend Auto Specialists. I was traveling from Las Vegas back to Arizona and my transmission acted up near Boulder City.  My father had just passed away 4 days prior to my leaving, I was still in shock. 
So now the car! I called this establishment and talked with Lee, who made me feel better. She told me that they were going to take care of me and they sure did. Top knot has and compassion too!  The price tag was steep because of the vacuum valve in the transmission BUT well worth it. They really did make me feel better and I recommend them for fast  courteous service.  Thank you Lee!"
positive,"I just moved to Vegas and I found out quickly that there were a lot of shady auto repair shops around here, not to mention I heard a lot of horror stories of people getting ripped off and being told things were fixed when they weren't. H-Tech Auto is NOT one of those shops.

Pete is a great mechanic. He is honest and more than reasonable, and will take you into the garage so you can see any problems with your car. Normally I don't get too many things done at once on my car with a new shop, but I took that risk with H-Tech Auto and I was glad I did. I had the timing belt and water pump replaced (among other things), transmission fluid (and the axle seal), brake pads, etc. done in one sitting. On top of that, he solved my long-term emissions problem. 

Another positive is that they use OEM parts, not the cheap aftermarket parts that are likely to be ineffective. 

I have definitely found my go-to auto shop now. Thank you for saving me money, my car, and being completely trustworthy!"
positive,"I had a great experience at this shop. The expensive Borla exhaust that I brought to them for installation was ""slightly off"" in how it was put together. The tips were uneven to the bumper by about 1/2"". I could hardly tell but the shop manager was extremely detail oriented and would not stand for an imperfect result! I had already gotten my quote for the installation ($80) but he insisted on cutting pipes, aligning the muffler tips, and rewelding the exhaust until it was perfect. He didn't charge me another cent and really made me feel like I was doing him a favor by letting him satisfy his OCD. :-)
Want your exhaust done right? Bring your car here."
positive,"This summer I had the misfortune of speeding along the highway when a pallet fell off a truck and quickly proceeded to damage the front end of my car.  Still drivable, I limped home my 2011, Infiniti G37 and started chatting with my insurance company about the repair.  While they had several recommendations, positive word of mouth led me to USA Collision.  On my first visit to their shop I had the opportunity of meeting with their President, David Robinson and found his straight forward candor and desire to please the customer a refreshing experience.  When I gave him the challenge that if I was going to pay a $1,000 co-pay to my insurance, I not only wanted my car repaired, but I wanted to add some custom flair, he didn't bat an eye.  Throughout the process he helped me add unique touches to my G, as well as kept an eye on my budget and time frame.  The end result was a G37 unlike any on the road, that I am both proud of and confident that it was repaired well.  Thank you USA Collision for your attention to detail and professionalism."
positive,"Just want to say a big thank you to the gentleman who took care of my wife today as well as our 2008 Honda Civic which needed some special treatment to it, i.e. transmission flush as well as fuel injector service and a smog check.​ My wife said the vehicle rides and runs smoother. Our Honda needed it that's for sure.

I briefly​ spoke to you on the phone and you sounded like you knew what you were talking​ about so I o.k.ed the service and also thanks for the deep discount you gave us so now we know where to bring our vehicles in the future. You've convinced me that you're​ my go too for any service that I need. Thanks so much.................

positive,My car was unfortunately hit while parked. Thankfully I had full coverage and my insurance worked directly with abra to get my car repaired quickly. Steve was very professional and kept me updated on the status of my repairs. When I went to go pick up my car Steve greeted me in a timely matter and showed me the repairs done to my car. They even took the time to buff out the headlights (which I've been neglecting) and clean the interior. My car looked better than before it was hit. The repairs are even covered for life. Steve even said that if I had a problem with any of the repairs to contact him and he'll take care of it himself.
positive,"I went into this Firestone because my check engine light was on and I was thinking my oil might be low. I told them about my check engine light and mentioned it might be my oil. I asked if I could purchase a couple quarts to top off my oil if that was the problem. The manager, John, told me to pull my car behind one of the other cars getting worked on and he would have one of his guys see if my oil was the problem for the light. Hunter, was nice enough to see that my oil was low and topped it off for me free of charge. He also cleared my check engine light so I could be on my way. You could see the shop was pretty busy, but they still went out of their way to help me out and they were so kind to do this free of charge. It truly was appreciated and you don't see that very often with car shops. Thank you to John and Hunter and to Firestone on Deer Valley! Acts like this definitely don't go unnoticed!"
positive,"Our check engine light went on after idling in the Arizona heat. Being from out of town, we started calling all Subaru dealerships in the greater Phoenix area and got turned away from all but Subaru Superstore of Surprise.  Brandon W. (Service Advisor) was nice enough to take us at our earliest convenience to run a diagnostic test. Once we arrived, Brandon remembered why we can come in and was ready to check our car. Not only did he provide us with a full explanation of the issue but was kind enough to send us home with the error message and part number for our home dealership. We appreciated the peace of mind Brandon gave us knowing the car was safe for the road trip back home."
positive,After years of great service can't say enough good things about Greg and his  team.  Very fair and very good  Thanks advanced transmission  !! John and Darla B.
positive,"The best thing about coming to Chinatown district for auto repair is that it costs half the price of auto repair services anywhere else in the valley. 

This place is a little difficult to find because it's located behind the Tofu Hut restaurant. It's not very visible from the streets. 

What I like the best about BUSY BUGGY is that they answer questions, and they answer the questions honestly. They don't feed you misleading information like 99% of the other auto repair places do. For example, many of the other auto repair places will say things like: ""You must only use the specific Transmission Fluid that your car's factory produces or your engine will DIE. That's why we gotta charge you more because we can't use a generic brand."" Now everyone who does their own auto repairs at home knows that is bullsh!t. I've been using a generic transmission fluid for the last 90k miles and my car runs like it's new. Here at BB motors, they won't lie to you like they would at the other auto repair shops. 

What makes this place especially great is that they do every kind of repair.  When my  engine light came on while driving to California, I first went to a guy in Orange County(Larry's Auto Repair), and he quoted me at around $4000 to fix it. I drove over here and the guy comes back to me a few minutes later and tells me it was from a previous ""misfire"" and that the car's computer system was merely getting confused and that no repairs were necessary. HOLY SH!T!! Now that's one honest guy!!!! He saved me $4000!!! And he said that even if my engine was having the type of problem that the previous scammer claimed, it would never cost that much. 

I will admit that I hate having to take my car in for an oil change. I'm one of those guys who needs to do it himself. Changing my own oil at home is actually one of my hobbies, and I used to look forward to it every 3 months. But, I recently moved into a community in the Providence district of Las Vegas that provides no garage or space where I can jack up my car and change my oil. So nowadays I have no choice but to bring it in. The pros of bringing my car in to BUSY BUGGY for an oil change is that it actually costs less! If I purchased 4 quarts of Quaker State(the least expensive), and an oil filter, it would come out to around $18.00. Here at BB I think it was like $12.00 for 4.5 quarts of high quality Castrol, oil filter, and they even check your air pressure, rotate you tires, fill your wiper fluid, check all fluid levels, and check your air filter, all for free. That's a great deal!

Customer service is great. It's like being at one of those 1950's full service garages from the old movies. The workers are all dressed nice and clean, and everything in the shop is so well organized. I've never seen such a spotless garage before. 

I can't believe how fast they get your car onto the lift. At all the other auto repair shops, they let your car sit in the parking lot for a while, and then some extremely obese guy covered in motor oil, waddles out to your car all lethargically. Usually it takes him about 5 minutes just to walk from the entrance of the garage to your car. Here at BB, the moment you drop your car off, they sprint out, jump in, and jack it up for repairs. It literally looks like those Nascar maintenance guys working on your car.  

5-Stars and my favorite Auto Repair shop in the world."
positive,"Took my 2002 Jeep Wrangler there for issues I had related to passing smog and a check engine light.  From the time Shlomi took my initial call until my service was complete, everything went smooth.  Shlomi is honest man, easy to talk to and very knowledgeable. 

I recommend him highly!"
positive,"Made an appointment after perusing YELP reviews for local muffler shops.  Was surprised to see a ""not so nice"" YELP review of a repair shop that I had used in the past, so decided to try Monro after reading their reviews.  The exhaust pipe from my catalytic converter to my muffler had broken. As a former weekend mechanic, I got under the car to examine. I knew that all I needed was a piece of pipe spliced between the two pipes. After leaving the car at the shop, was wondering whether they'd call and try to ""talk me"" into a new exhaust system...well, they didn't!  Picked the car up and paid what they had quoted;  I'm now driving around and once again able to hear my radio  - thanks Monro!"
positive,"No one likes needing to get their car fixed. It's even less fun when your car is new.

A coyote ruined my day unexpectedly (I guess I ruined his day too...) and caused what looked like superficial damage to my one-year-old CRV. Inconvenient, but no big deal. I'm pretty new to the area and no one had any shop recommendations for me, so I scoured Google and Yelp and kept seeing great reviews for Orlando. I checked out their website and I was sold (really, go check it out!).

These guys know their stuff, and they're thorough. What seemed like a fairly minor accident ended up being pretty major - the coyote hit a lot of parts on his way out. A lot of them were only damaged a little bit, but Orlando found ALL the damage, and replaced Every. Single. Part. I also got updates from them along the way explaining what needed fixing and what the ETA would be.

Not only was everyone so nice, and not only does the work come with a warranty, but they washed and did a basic detail on my car. All my dog's nose smudges were cleaned off the windows (don't worry, she's replaced most of them already!) and all the dust and dog fur wiped and vacuumed. In and out it was cleaned with care, when the dealer doesn't even bother to run it through the wash when I go in for service.

At every interaction I felt like they cared about me, my car, and the quality and detail put into their work. This is how a small business stands out from the crowd. I hope I never have to get my car repaired again, but if I do, this is where I will go."
positive,"I was referred to this place because my regular mechanic couldn't figure out what was wrong. Every time I took off from a stop my car didn't want to get in gear. It would take a couple times of pressing the gas pedal then jump into gear. I was expecting a huge bill. However, the mechanic found three wires that needed to be replaced and I paid under $100. My car is running great now. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. This is the place to go for transmission issues."
positive,We've taken our vehicle here for some check engine light issues. Staff here is hard working and honest. They do their best to locate the issue and fix it. I'll definitely comeback. Pricing is decent too.
positive,"When one of our company vehicles started having transmission problems, I thought they would immediately tell us we needed a new transmission.  Not only is that expensive, but our money making vehicle would be down for a couple days.  To my surprise they recommended flushing first because they didn't want to jump to conclusions.  Not only did the flush work, my guy and truck was back on the road within an hour (I didn't even make an appointment) saving me thousands.  After the flush, they checked back with me & the driver to make sure everything was running smoothly, who does that, no one expect Advanced."
positive,"We were in an accident recently and needed to get our car repaired 
I looked up car repair shops in our area and found Chaneys
Today we came to pick up our car and I have to say, it looks like a brand new car 
Chaneys was very good about keeping us updated with everything 
I highly recommend it 
Hopefully We won't need to use them again but if we did, it would definitely be Chaneys"
positive,"On my way from California to Vegas my car stalled and lost acceleration. I pulled over and noticed the check engine light and that there was minimal oil. We kept driving in hopes and prayers going 25- 60 mph with the gas pedal all the way down. When we finally got to Vegas and let the car cool the following morning we checked the oil and it had the bare minimum. I had an oil change from Kia the prior week so I was baffled as to why there was no oil. 

I called Busy Buggy and spoke to Marco inquiring about a knock sensor because I had received a P1326 code and also let him know there was no oil in the car. He recommended we put oil in the car and to bring it over. So we did. 

Thankfully I did not need a sensor but only an oil change and he removed the check engine light. I'm still baffled as to where my oil went because he showed me that there were no leaks and the oil was not burning. 

I still had  about 2k miles to go for a new oil change. I'm not sure if the oil change was necessary or if he could of just removed the check engine light and I could of just added more oil. 

Marco is really nice and he did help but.... he also tried to get me to buy more from him. 

He stated I needed a new air filter which I bought.

And he also said my back breaks were ""metal to metal"" and If I wanted to get them done it would be $270ish. I told him no he said they had a guarantee of 12,000 miles. (I don't even live in Vegas and it doesn't make sense to me as to why I would drive to another state to get my breaks done after 12k) Also I just had them checked the week prior and was told they were good by Kia and which I went to Kia again after I got back home and told them that I was told my breaks were metal to metal. Kia stated they were ""not"" metal to metal and they were 6/32 and new are 10's. 

I will give both of them the benefit of the doubt. 

I was charged $50 to have my car looked at for leaks which I did not argue.. I did not have time.. although when I was on the phone I wish I would of been told about the charge when he said ""Come on in! We will check it out."" 

He also keeps the lobby and restroom clean and stocked. 

Overall I'm just glad my car was taken care of and good to go back on the road!"
positive,Ken and Bo found why my check engine light would not shut off after the replace the O2 sensor twice the found 4 broken wires and if I would of left it that way it could of took out my computer. They save me some money and they do a great job every time I bring a vehicle in.
positive,"Quick service, honored the workmanship warranty.

Our car was overheating when the A/C was turned on, our extended warranty works with Meineke, so we brought it here to get check. They found the issue and was able to replace the part the same day, used our warranty coverage and we left just paying a small deductible and sales tax.

Car worked great for a few days and it was overheating with the check engine light. So we had to tow it back to this location. They were busy and said it would be a bit, but we understood. Soon after we left, thinking it might need to stay overnight, they called us back within the hour. Said it was a loose connection with the part new part. Had it reinstalled and tightened, we could go back to pick it up anytime before closing.

Although there was a mishap in their installation the first time, in which they apologized for. they didn't try to up sell anything or tag on additional issues that needed fixing. It was an honest replace, repair, warranty honored!"
positive,"Called when I had an issue with my car they got me in that day and out in an hour and twenty minutes. They even checked my ac for free and checked my transmission after being told by another shop there was a leak. Customer service was fantastic and I never once felt as if I was pressured or talked down too. This will be my go to place when my car needs anything done. Friendly staff, great service give them a shot if you car needs a checkup."
positive,"Had my car repaired at Caliber and I couldn't be more happy with the work. Lindsay took great care of me. She made sure I was aware of the process the whole time and when I got my car back it was earlier than I was told it would be. I have dealt with collision centers in the past and the experience was not very pleasant. I am pleased to know that they are not all the same. I will never have any of my vehicles repaired anywhere else. If you are looking for a reliable, trustworthy place that knows what they are doing this is it. Go in and see Lindsay, you won't be disappointed."
positive,"Had my car inspected, 4 new tires and oil change. Quick, friendly and reasonably priced service. The updates done to the shop really make the building stand out and adapt to the new renovations of East Liberty. Highly recommend this Aamco location to anyone looking to get their car worked on, right! Not just a transmission shop! I will be putting the word out about the great service here."
positive,"My youngest daughter is in the US Army stationed out of state. She has a car but it's here in AZ and an older one so she wanted something new with a warranty. After a lot of research, she decided she wanted a Hyundai Kona. I called several dealerships to find the color and options she wanted, however none of the dealerships had exactly what she wanted.  We made an open appointment with Kevin and showed up Saturday.  Kevin introduced us to DJ who handled the salesman duties for us.  We drove two different models to see which engine/transmission combo she wanted. She picked the 1.6 Turbo that only comes in the Limited/Ultimate trim level. Kevin, DJ and the team worked hard to get us the financing and price that fit our daughter's budget. It took a little longer than they had anticipated so Kevin bought us supper that evening.  Our overall experience at Earnhardt Hyundai was a pleasant one and we definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an honest deal. Thanks!"
positive,Took my car transmission rebuilt got it back In two days  very satisfied with the work and did everything they said they would do will return for any future work thanks
positive,"When one goes looking for a low priced used car, one likely will find a dealer like Gasparr.  Recently I went looking for a used low price auto that I wanted for just sports like fishing and bicycling.  I came across Gasparr and decide to check it out despite poor reviews,  I met the manager and he showed me a few. The one car I knew about from an ad was not to my liking and I asked him what else he might have.  The manager was knowledgeable and there was absolutely no pressure.   He never tried to tell me the cars were gone over by mechanics and cleaned up like at the uptown dealers. This is to be expected at such places.   I suspect the bad reviews came from people who did not fully understand the place in the market such small low price dealers occupy.   So he showed me a great car, blemish free, new tires and (relatively) low mileage. He said  that to cover his concern that since it was 10 years old something might break he would pay for a warranty policy to cover major iitems for 3 months. Seemed more than fair.   I paid cash so I do not know about financing. But a few days later the quality of Gasparr was put to the test.   I began to have problems with the transmission. I called to explain and without a moment's hesitation the manager said to bring it back - he'll fix it.  I drove the car back and within a few days he fixed it no extra charge!   Another test came a few days later when the transmission gave me a second problem. Called again and once again without hesitation - and in a matter of hours - HE SENT A TOW TRUCK TO BRING THE CAR BACK FOR THE TRANSMISSION ADJUSTMENT.  This time the car was fixed in one day.   Look, it is an older car, full of old car surprises. Gasparr could have stuck me with it, He did not. He made it right without a hassle of any kind!   He far exceeded any expectation I had about how a small low priced car dealer would behave.   Could not be happier with my new old car."
positive,"My son, who is only in Arizona for school, took his car into All Pro Transmission because the transmission was acting funny. Jim said the wiring harness had been chewed by vermin, which caused the transmission to fail so needed to find the problem and fix it before driving it. My son knew before he left for school there was wiring issues. Jim had several mechanics/experts look at it and try to find solutions without the expense of a new wiring harness, with no luck. It took almost 30 days for this process, including the time it took to replace the transmission.  He then recommended Louie at Meet Your Mechanic. Louie found the problem quickly and was able to resolve the issue at a reasonable cost. Jim tried to resolve the matter in his shop, i only wish he would have recommended Louis/Meet Your Mechanic sooner. So far no issues and my son has been driving it for a few weeks. Jim was gracious to incur the expenses these others had charged, and also towed the car for my son to Louis' shop. Thank you for that, Jim! The cost of the transmission was fair and reasonable. I felt Jim was honest, caring and very much wanted to save us from more financial burden."
positive,"I went to Dave's Auto Service on Pflaum Road, Madison , Wi. Service advisor informed me to go online and register on Yelp.Com. To get a 20 percent discount on my service. GREAT advice saved 24 dollars on change transmission fluid. Each time that is applied great info. Free Wi fi , beverage and TV."
positive,"Just left with a 6.2l Yukob sounding like a v8 is supposed to. Did a highway run at 75mph.  The Magnaflow they recommended put the perfect amount of growl into wide open throttle with little to no noticeable drone at low rpm in 4 or 8 cylinder mode. This is the 4th or 7th time in 20 years these guys listened to what I asked for and nailed on the first go. 

Need muffler/exhaust work?  Go here everytime. 

Update:  did a 2800 mile trip and no issues with the tone. Quiet cabin, until you mat it. Then, yep, the appropriate amount of get-out-of-the-way growl."
positive,"I was in an accident where in my car was struck from behind by another vehicle. I took my vehicle to a Nationwide blue ribbon repair shop in my area. A month later they called to let me know my vehicle was repaired. I took my car to Pack Brothers in Belmont for a vehicle repair inspection. Long story short, Pack brothers discovered that my car had not been repaired at all...just covered up. They determined that my ""repaired"" car was not safe to drive. With help from Pack Brothers and Collision Safety Consultants, Nationwide insurance and their blue ribbon repair shop was forced to correct the problem. Had it not been for these fine folks, I'd probably still be fighting to get my vehicle fixed. I live a couple hundred miles away from Pack Brothers, but this is where I'll take my next damaged vehicle. Don't be strong armed by an insurance company who isn't interested in your satisfaction. According to NC state law, where you get your car repaired in YOUR choice. My choice from this day forward is Pack Brothers."
positive,"Best service... PERIOD...

I knew I needed a new transmission and Advanced Transmission was my 3rd call to get info... As soon as the phone was answered by Denise I had a good feeling about their business... She sent me to Bill... Not only did he ask all the correct questions he was able to answer all my questions... He explained there were 3 main choices for a new transmission... After a few minutes he didn't try and upsell me... He told me the most expensive would be more than I needed... Recommended the middle choice and it was over $800 less than the other 2 calls... At that point I was confident this was the place... Bill put me at ease about spending a good chunk of money... Greg also is top notch with knowledge and customer service... Their technitions went above and beyond what I expected... There was another underlaying problem and was able to trouble shoot it with no cost... They did the other repair and I checked other places out if curiosity... Saved another $200... Do not... I repeat DO NOT HESITATE going with Advanced Transmissions... From outstanding customer service to the outstanding workmanship... Thank you Denise, Bill and Greg... Along with all their technicians"
positive,"Recently brought my Tacoma in for an inspection after seeing leakage around the transmission oil pan during a recent oil change.  I also asked for a tire rotation.  They emailed me a complete inspection report/findings w/ pictures.  The inspection and tire rotation was free.  I then scheduled to have the tranny oil pan seal replaced a couple days later.  No hassles here, no up selling on things that don't need to be done.  I'll definitely be coming back here."
positive,I have found my new mechanic!!! I highly recommend Shlomi and his team here at A B-Z Auto.  I dropped my car off  at 8:15 with a failed SMOG and a check engine light on. Shlomi took me right in and he was done by 1:30! He went above and beyond to take care of me AND sent me on my way with my passing Smog ! And then called me the next day to ask how my car was running.  Thank you for the excellent service!  Oh! And did I mention how nice and clean the waiting area is?! WOW!!!! I will send all I know to A B-Z Auto! !!
positive,"I've had exhaust work done at other muffler shops it's been poorly welded and exhaust leaks within the first month :(.  So I decided to come to performance muffler by people's ratings on here and on Google and they are right, excellent  quality, and inexpensive work love the dual muffler setup on my 1993 Chevy 454ss. Thanks Joe, job well done my wife is really happy with her truck and the way it sounds really brought are truck to life.  star rating from us both.  keep up the good work. I will be referring a bunch of friends that are working on projects and are asking about a good muffler shop."
positive,"Excellent Service!

I brought my Land Rover here for transmission issues. Terry was at the desk and was super friendly. I am always apprehensive about new shops as we all usually worry about having people charge and charge us for everything and all the auto repair stereotypes. 

I found Huff to have given me honest advice and they quickly ascertained what the issues were and called me to give me options. 

A rare shop that gave good service!"
positive,Went to Dimaggio's with what seemed to be a loose muffler making a clunking sound. Dimaggio's took care of the problem quickly and fixed what was a loose hanging clamp. I was amazed that they did this and said there would be no charge for the repair. I will certainly take my vehicle to Dimaggio's for all future service.
positive,"Busy buggy. Been coming here for about 3 years. It's started with a simple oil change 3 years ago, came in and was greeted and offered cookies and beverages. Been coming here for small things ever since. But not until Thursday of last week was I fully thankful. Took my wife's car in. Turns out it was the transmission. Go figure. 2011 chevy equinox with less than 100k miles. They took about a week, waiting for the dealership to deliver etc. Finally picked it up today and I am glad I brought it here. Honest hard working owner and team. Will continue to come here as long as I'm treated fairly as I have for the past 3 years. Thanx busy buggy car is running like the first time I took it out of the dealership and wife is extremely happy. Owner Hamid I think that's his name is an honest guy from what I've come to know of him. Will continue to come here and send u more of my friends."
positive,"Took my car here to get some damaged repaired and from the first call I made to set up an appointment, to picking up my vehicle the staff there made it super easy. Dennis was amazing, he answered all of my questions and explained everything and he was really nice and listened to all of my concerns. The repairs were done quickly and my car was ready when they said it would be. I would definitely return here if I ever have a need to get a car repaired again."
positive,"Rotary Evolution is a highly skilled, very knowledgeable engine builder and mechanic.  I've owned several RX-7's (2nd and 3rd generation) and kept only two.  One is a low mileage well-maintained, unmodified street machine.  And the other is a track car repaired by Ben, the owner of Rotary Evolution.

As many in the RX-7 community can appreciate, these cars are aging homes to various gremlins that can be difficult to troubleshoot and diagnose.  My car had a phantom fuel issue for several years.  I spent two years taking it to various Mazda / rotary shops in the Bay Area, to no avail.  Many hours and literally $thousands had been thrown at the problem with absolutely no results.  I was ready to give up and ditch the car, but the online rotary community came to the rescue and recommended the services of Rotary Evolution.  Basically, I told Ben, ""I don't care how long you have it, what you do, or how long it takes.  Just let me know when it's done."" Ben literally spent a hundred hours over the following months tinkering with the car and finally sorted out the problem using some unorthodox procedures.

They charged a very reasonable rate and I couldn't have been happier with the result.  As I continued making modifications and improvements, I hired Rotary Evolution for two dyno tuning sessions.  With a properly designed exhaust and ignition + fuel map corrections, Ben was able to raise its power output by +33 hp at the wheels, which is pretty good for a naturally aspirated 13B.

The engine itself was rebuilt by Rotary Evolution for the car's previous two owners.  Ben was very forthcoming in describing some of the limitations that were holding it back from making the power that it should, and suggested further modifications for a future rebuild.  I recently sent him a set of rotor housing to resurface.  Upon receipt, he reminded me that, for track purposes, they need exhaust port modification, and offered to do it for a good price.

If I ever again come across an unsolvable problem with any rotary-powered car, I'd be willing to ship or make the drive to Las Vegas and hand it over to Rotary Evolution.

Las Vegas is lucky to have a world-class engine builder that knows RX-7's inside and out!"
positive,"I came here for the first time to get my oil changed. 
Marco came to me afterwards and let me know my starter was having issues & then quoted me for what that would cost to fix it.

I took it in the next day to get the service done & they told me it should only take an hour. Well...they had my car for 8 hours that day and didn't tell me what was going on with it. (This is the only thing I wasn't happy about) 
When I came to pick up the car, Marco told me they thought the issue had to do with my transmission control module & there was a code coming up on my car to get it fixed by ford as it was a recall. 
Marco promised me that if I took it to Ford and they told me it had nothing to do with my starter- that he would refund me.

Well, long story short- that's exactly what happened. Thank you to Marco who made sure I didn't get ripped off or have to pay extra money for something that was never broken on my car. I really appreciated his willingness to take ownership of the mis-diagnosis & for being so transparent at the end. 

He has my trust & I will come here for future work for sure!"
positive,We have been bringing our Mercedes S550 and our Range Rover Sport here since we moved to Arizona about 4 years ago. They have been more than fair and always a help to me and my wife even when I am out of town for months at a time. They always give us their full attention every time even if it's just for the check engine light being on. We are always confident that when we drop our cars off that it always comes back running like a champ. Thank you for all that you guys do for us.
positive,"Mike saved me from an imminent meltdown tonight. 

My cars transmission blew. I left my car at the auto shop, but forgot to take my house key off the ring. I get home after the shop is closed. I have a 4 year old with me. 

I look up locksmiths nearby and get ahold of mike. I kid you not, he was at my house five minutes later and got me and my kid back inside. 

He is professional, friendly, and incredibly fast. If I ever am this stupid again, I'll definitely know who to call."
positive,Such friendly people I had my transmission redone and they were very friendly and answered all my questions and even when I came in with my front bumper dangling a bit off they fixed my bumper when I didnt even mention it I was so happy and thanked them for my new transmission and for my bumper fix..thank you guys I appriciate it so much..
positive,Rebel has THE BEST customer service! My check engine light turned on and my registration was due in a few days. the guys at Rebel are so awesome they took my car in to get smogged for me the same day my registration was due because they knew they were going to need to keep my car to run the proper test to turn it back over to me. They called me to let me know I can go online and pay my registration before it was due before 5pm to avoid any late fees. thank you so much rebel automotive you make having to take a car into a mechanic a lot less stressful!!!!!
positive,"I have been using Advanced Transmissions for over 10 years -- my family and business, and they have always provided A+ service. My first major experience was about 10 years ago. The Honda dealership quoted $4,200 to fix my transmission and Advanced Transmissions did it for $2,200, and it worked great. This morning, I called them to fix my daughter's starter. They arranged for the tow and the car was completed by 1:00 pm. Their quick service sure made my day go much easier. The owner Greg has always been super helpful to me over the years."
positive,"I am always slightly skeptical about a business who has 5/5 Stars. Especially with so many reviews. How can this be?! Well, after witnessing the service level at T & M I can say that I get it now. 

I was set to drive from Las Vegas to Denver, CO but the week prior my check engine light came on. I checked my gas cap, opened the hood of my car to pretend like I knew what to look for. I did it all. I called around and the only place who could run a diagnostic was this place. Thankfully nothing was wrong but I was so impressed with their kindness that I made an appointment to get my oil changed the day I was leaving town. 

They were so nice and remembered me. While I waited they made small talk with me in the lobby and were calling customers to remind them about oil changes or parts updates. They knew almost everyone by name that came in. It was impressive. 

My oil change was under $60 and they were quick (with an appointment). I'm sure hearing from any repair shop that you're going to have to form over a bunch of money for a repair isn't fun but I'd rather hear it from and support a place I trust."
positive,"I've had 3 of my cars here for an exhaust work and every single one has been a great experience.  I have been to other muffler shops in the past and these guys do a better job with the overall work, customer service and professional conduct.  They really also warranty their work which is may not be the case elsewhere.  The owner is always around and ensures you're happy with the final product."
positive,"A+ work, honest and friendly. Far less expensive than any dealer!

If you have a VW or Audi, don't take it anywhere else. The owner, Derek has a love for all things VW and Audi and knows every detail from basic maintenance to building full boosted race cars. He has personally maintained my Audi TT and easily drafted up the plans for a full turbo build. Derek knows how to maintain the DSG transmissions, Haldex Quattro units and everything else quirky about the brand. If only I could bring all my vehicles to him!

Personal suggestion is to not call or email Exklusiv as they are always busy buried in car work. Just show up!"
positive,"What an amazing experience! I went there to have them test and print up why my check engine light was on. While I was there I thought might as well check my battery. Damian went above and beyond by not only checking my battery once but a couple times to make sure it was holding a charge, turns out it wasn't. He replaced it and printed out what was wrong with my car (it needed coolant). Thanks Damian! I will always go back here!!"
positive,"I had a great experience when I bought my car last year.  The salesman was friendly and helpful (as he should be when I spend that kind of dough on a car).  I was smart enough to get my trade in appraised by Car Max FIRST, before going to the Audi dealership.  Since they know that Car Max will honor that value for 7 days, Audi had to honor it as well, if they wanted to sell me a car.  They ended up giving me a little extra.  Let me say that, thank goodness the remainder of the warranty was included in the price, because I ended up having some major issues with the car (a 2008 A4 Turbo) about 3 months after I bought it.

I took the car into the service department, and they were unable to find anything wrong with it.  They suggested I just get the oil changed, which I did.  After a weekend road trip to San Diego, the car was barely running, so I had to take it back in.  Nancy and Brett were both really helpful, and I understand that the situation was not their fault.  They did all they could do.  However, the mechanics could not figure out what was causing the issue.  They started out by replacing some fuel pumps.  That didn't solve the problem.  Then they replaced the transmission.  Still no luck.  Finally, they brought in a specialist from Germany and ended up replacing the entire engine.  That fixed it, but they had my car for over a month.  Luckily, I was cruising around in a sweet loaner 2012 Q5 while they had my car.  It is just a bit disappointing that I had such major issues with a car I purchased just a few months prior.  They still never figured out what the problem was, but it is all fixed.  Recently, I have replaced my battery and scheduled some maintenance (for 35k miles), and Brice, who is the service manager, has been awesome.  The service department is very busy (can't help but think it's because they might sell lemons like they did to me, but whatever), so if you will require a loaner car, you need to make advance arrangements.

It may sound strange, but I work for a luxury hotel, and verbiage is very important to us.  That being said, I really think that the receptionists need to work on their verbiage.  Sometimes when I call, I feel like they are bothered by having to assist me. They aren't always so friendly, which is unfortunate for the cost of the product they are selling.

Service on Audis is VERY expensive in general.  If you are considering buying one of these vehicles, I would suggest the Audi Care package - otherwise you will be paying an arm and a leg anytime your car requires an oil change or scheduled maintenance.  I wish that I would have bought this option, but it was not offered to me when I purchased my car.

Overall, I think that you get personalized service (which is expected), and they do not just treat you like a ""number.""  I can't imagine buying anything other than an Audi in the future, even though I may not have had the best experience this time around."
positive,"My truck is at 100k miles and has never broke down.  My window motor recently died in two different windows, two separate months, I figured 100k miles is time for a checkup. They looked my car up and down, they let me know what needs to be replaced and what can wait. Turns out I needed shocks and hub bearings.  Some other parts were worn but not warranting replacement yet.  So i had them fix it, had my truck back the same day, now i go to them for oil changes too because honest mechanics are hard to find, but once you find one you will never go anywhere else. 

On a side note, a friend of mine thought she had a bad transmission, she brought her car here, turns out it was just a timing issue. So instead of forking out over 1000 bucks for a new transmission she ended up with a bill for around 50 dollars in labor. 

That being said, this place values the relationship they build with the community over the almighty dollar.

That being said, I'll be back for oil changes and preventive maintenance on my current car, my wife's current car and every other car we buy in the future. Because good honest mechanics are hard to come by."
positive,"I like Tim Walter so much, I almost wish my car would break down so I would have an excuse to see him. 

He is super honest, explains everything, gets the cheapest appropriate parts he can, and isn't the least bit condescending. Picture the kindest surgeon you can; Tim Walter is the same, just for cars instead. 

Also, the man has a great memory. He *still* makes fun of me for that Coke can I had strapped to my muffler 7 years ago."
positive,"My oil change and transmission drain/fill turnout to be cheaper then independent shop, and i got a free carwash and vacuum!  I'll be back!"
positive,"Found the truck online and called them on Labor Day. Went and saw the truck the next day. Met them and loved how down to earth, honest and welcoming all of them were, especially Kathleen. Walked out with a 15 day/500 mile warranty on transmission and engine. Day 7, mile 410, transmission clutch was slipping. Called them up, and true to their word they got me into a transmission shop and had the clutch replaced under their warranty. A persons word goes a long way with me and they honored theirs. I will definitely recommend anyone I know to buy from them and will check them out first when it's time to buy my wife a new car."
positive,"The manager and mechanics are kind, honest people who provide phenomenal service. I went in to have my muffler and center pipe replaced due to rusting issues. 

They saved me $600 over the dealership service quote, had the required parts delivered within the hour, and finished the maintenance itself in about an hour.  

I felt entirely comfortable trusting my car to them, and plan to have all of my future servicing done here."
positive,"Being a huge car guy, I thought I would try out Scottsdale Muffler.  Called, made an appointment to get a muffler that I bought installed on my Jaguar S Type R.  I showed up on time, and in a few minutes they took my car around.  Then they called me out to show me that it wouldn't fit.  I really liked that, because rather than give me some story, they showed me the issue and explained it thoroughly.

Fast forward a few weeks.  I buy the correct muffler, make an appointment, show up, and they take the car around on time.  A few minutes later I hear them working on the car.  In an hour, they were done.  Top notch welding, no BS, and they didn't mine working on my luxury car, all while respecting my time and busy schedule.  Very reasonable labor rate too.

I will be back in the future and highly recommended!!!"
positive,"I've been in for two services now, and these guys are top notch!  My 40K transmission service was about half the price the dealer wanted and also half the price of my former mechanic!  The price I was quoted on the phone with just the general inquiry was the same price I was quoted once I arrived, and that was the final price.  There was no upselling like you typically get with some mechanics.  

The reception area is neat and clean and modern, with USB and a place to plug in your laptop.  Very important to me, because I like to wait for my car and work on my laptop.  I was offered coffee/water/soda and taken back to the Keurig for fresh coffee.  

Let me say, I dread using public bathrooms, but they have separate men's and women's restrooms, and it was spotless!  The atmosphere is very family-like.  Eddie and Moe are super nice guys who seem to really like what they do, and they answered all of my questions thoroughly.  I like the fact that they have the two dogs too!

Another thing that pleasantly surprised me is a mechanic who is actually intuitive and reset the service alert without me mentioning it.  It appeared in between my transmission service and subsequent oil change.  I forgot to ask them if they could reset that.  Lo and behold, I get in the car...no annoying service alert!  It's something small but shows me that they are observant to more than just the service at hand and are looking at the big picture.

I will be coming back here for anything I need in the future for my VW GLI!  Definitely recommend CARS!"
positive,"I shopped around a bit for the check engine light I had on that was related to an evap system leak.  The other shop wanted $96 for the diagnostic alone. Pep boys charged me $45 for the diagnostic and when they'd found the issue they called me up and asked if I wanted it repaired.  Since I did get it repaired they rolled that $45 charge into the payment for the repair.  They gave me a quote over the phone and when I went to pick up the vehicle the actual charge was $4 less.  Its not a whole lot of a difference, but at least it was in my favor.

I found the customer service here to be especially good.  All of the staff was very friendly.  There was sometimes a wait for service but nothing out of the ordinary for an auto parts store or an auto service shop."
positive,Purrfect Auto has exceeded my expectations! Truly standing by their warranty with ace mechanics this place receives my most sincere recommendations. I had a check engine light that was very difficult to figure out but Purrfect auto worked to find the problem and made sure the issue was resolved. Thank you Purrfect Auto!
positive,"I brought my van to Scottsdale Muffler & Automotive at the recommendation of my very knowledgeable mechanic; he knows who is good  and who isn't!

I talked to Chris on the phone and told him my mechanic was recommending a catalytic converter for my van to help me pass the state emissions inspection. He asked me a couple of questions and let me know that they could have my van done in about 45 minutes and quoted me a price, which was less than half of any other shops I contacted!

However, I like to do as much of my own vehicle maintenance as I can, so I looked into what it would take to replace my own catalytic converter. Turns out, I would actually have to spend about $100 MORE to do the work myself!!!

I quickly called and set up an appointment!

While waiting in the lobby, the mechanic working on my van came in and said he needed to show me something (oh no, here we go!).

He showed me that my muffler had a pretty large crack in it. He offered to replace the muffler with a new one for $115, which I thought was a very fair price for my vehicle. I asked if the crack was causing any performance problems and he said no. I then asked if the crack could be welded and if the muffler would work ok with this fix. He said yes, and offered to do this repair for only $30! 

Here's the really cool thing: he could have easily told me that my performance would suffer if I didn't buy a new muffler. And I would have believed him. I know quite a bit about cars, but not everything. I was ready to go ahead with the new muffler if he said I needed it. But he was HONEST and let me know that a simple and inexpensive weld would take care of things.

As a small business owner myself, I really appreciate it when other businesses treat me well. I am happy to say that the folks over at Scottsdale Muffler & Automotive will have all of my future business!"
positive,We had a outstanding experience with Zain Engineer the service Manager. He went above and beyond to help us concerning warranty issues and transmission issues. He was extremely professional and helped to guide us with any questions we had. Highly recommend talking to Zain for any service issues you have at  Nissan AutoNation.
positive,"Scott and his crew have been beyond helpful to me during the last 9 months that I have used them.  Whether it is helping me find the right battery for my truck or doing a bumper to bumper inspection of a used car I bought they have always been accommodating and able to fit me in whether it's a scheduled appointment or an emergency.

Recently they were able to change out the 12v battery on my hybrid after I picked it up from next door and getting accident damage repaired.  During the course of the repair the battery died and they were able to get me in and help me change it out.  Normally I would do it myself but I was 7 months pregnant, recently in an accident, and couldn't lift the battery.  They even checked my check engine light for me but unfortunately it spit out some weird code even they couldn't figure out.

All in all Whitey's has been around since before I was born and has continues to be at the top of their game.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in the area.  I don't mind driving from central Phoenix to have someone I trust work on my car."
positive,Awesome experience. They got me in right away on a Saturday and gave me a fair price for a new muffler. The only place I'll go for exhaust work.
positive,"I dropped of my Audi A3 for 35k service, 2 days prior a check engine light came on which i paid no attention to. The drop off was smooth everyone at the dealership was friendly, there were people ahead of me but didn't wait long at all. Then the shuttle service took me to work. I think 2-3 hours later i got a call from my service advisor saying that the check engine light was on and it was caused by a high pressure fuel pump that was about to fail. The good news was warranty covers all the parts/labor needed, the bad news the part was not available and will come in the following day. I was little disappointed about that since i needed a vehicle to get around, which they offered me a loaner vehicle, i was able to get back to the dealership get my loaner car without any hassle. Got my car the following day, the service advisor explained everything that was done to the car, what parts may potentially need replacing. 

I just want to say what a great service Audi of Henderson provides. Audi makes quality products already but part of great car ownership and brand loyalty is the quality and honesty of the brands ""service departments"". Service departments are who customers deal with the most post purchase. The car buying process takes about 5-6hrs or so and the relationship between the sales person and buyer may continue or end with no consequence, but after buying a car you need to have a good honest, quality service department for its up keep for years to come. I really think that this is one of the most important aspects of car ownership. I hope Audi of Henderson keep their high quality standards in customer/car care. Audi Of America keep setting high standards for your car dealership/service departments, keep policing those that don't perform well."
positive,"This has got to be THE most HONEST MECHANIC I have ever been to.  Not only is it convenient (right at the corner of Bloor and Bathurst, with key drop option available), but they are ridiculously honest I'm actually in disbelief as I type this review.  The people who work there are super friendly too, they never make you feel stupid and as a woman with a truck I'm weary people will take advantage of me or talk down to me, but that never happens here.  The customer service is amazing and the people make you feel like family.   My experiences here have been as follows:

- First time I came here was because I felt like my alignment was off the night before a trip to Montreal - I needed to get the alignment and hopefully an oil change done first thing on a Friday morning cuz I had to be on the road to Mtl. by noon.  I used to go to Canadian Tire but they were unable to accommodate me for a morning appointment the next day because they said it takes several hours to do an alignment.  Feeling more desperate,  I called Midas as a last resort because I (wrongly) ass-u-med they'd be kinda expensive - but it turns out their cost for an alignment was actually CHEAPER than Canadian Tire and they were able to see me first thing the next morning!  On top of that, their website has coupons for $ off any work and oil change deals so #protip: make sure to check out the Midas website and grab your coupons before you go.  I dropped the truck off at 9am and by 10am I got a phone call from them - ""Truck is ready to be picked up, your alignment was fine, we have a printout of the specs to show you, so we didn't need to do the work after all, we did do the oil change, come on down and get your truck!""   My jaw literally dropped to the floor.  A MECHANIC TELLING ME THE WORK WASN'T NECESSARY, not charging me a dime, in the heart of downtown Toronto?  THIS IS UNHEARD OF.  Needless to say, I made it on the road in time, confident with my alignment, with the extra $ I had set aside to spend on the alignment still in my pocket to splurge on my trip!  Not only that, they did an ENTIRE vehicle inspection checkup/spec/printout sheet to show me free of charge when I went to pick up my truck.  Midas won me over as a customer right then and there. Canadian Tire who? lol 

-Second time I came here was cuz my muffler was making a rattling noise on acceleration. I got my brother to help me isolate the noise before calling the garage so we knew that it was coming from the exhaust system.   I was reluctant to bring my truck in anywhere cuz I was afraid of how much even just a diagnostic/estimate would cost me.  It turns out Midas at Bloor/Bathurst does the inspection and estimates for free!!!  Brought my vehicle in before work, and by 11am they were on the phone with me to let me know the ""damage"" - turns out it was just a loose clip.  They replaced it for FREE.  They told me that the vehicle was fixed and ready to be picked up, and everything looks great and I owe them NOTHING.  I was sitting here prepared to spend in the ballpark of $1000 for repairs and it turns out I owe $0.00.  If I could have hugged the guy through the phone I would have. 

Just also note it seems like I'm bringing my vehicle for all these unnecessary repairs - no.  I am not a rich woman so when I bring my truck to the garage it's cuz I'm trying to avoid MORE costly repairs in the future (i.e. having to buy new tires for driving w/ the alignment off for too long, and not just ignoring a noisy exhaust/muffler issue).  I'm not some nitpicky person when it comes to my truck - it's got lots of untreated cosmetic damage from when my mom backed into me (lol) and a crack along the bottom windshield from a pebble hitting the windshield during a bad storm -  but I do like to address preventable driveability issues before they get worse. This mechanic is so honest it's actually ridiculous and they are so friendly and nice I feel like finding them was akin to having a horseshoe up my A$$. PRICES ARE ENTIRELY REASONABLE - cheaper than Canadian Tire and service is way more personalized -  Please go to this garage, they are amazing!!!!"
positive,"I took my 2014 Nissan Altima here for the first time after the car had a complete transmission failure after a drive from Orange County.  This was an unexpected issue as the car is relatively new and has low miles. I was in Vegas on vacation, not to have the transmission replaced. However, I cannot say enough good things about Auto Nation Nissan, specifically the service associate Mike,100% professional.  His professionalism and service is top notch.  He was very empathetic to my situation and reassured me that the car was under warranty and reassured me that it would be fixed expeditiously. I am 100% pleased with my service experience here and appreciate Mike for keeping me up to date on the details and for going above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you Mike I hope the dealership realizes you are an asset to the team."
positive,"I just cant say enough about these guys.  I took my car in yesterday for an oil change and my check engine light was also on.  They changed my oil no problem and my engine light was on because I needed a new gas cap.  I was SOO relieved.  These guys are totally honest AND reliable.  These are the kind of guys that I KNOW if and when I need them to do a big job, I'm not going to have to call around to price the job with other competitors, these guys are the BEST!  My boss has been using them for years and that is how I found out about them.  I am divorced so I don't have anyone to work on my Jeep but now I have these guys.  They can never close up shop because I don't know what I will do.  I don't want to go to ANYONE ELSE.  They also put on my registration sticker on my plate because I didn't have the tool to get off the license plate cover.  They are just GOOD GUYS.  Thank you Al!"
positive,"This is the second vehicle that I have taken to Chris at Scottsdale muffler, and they did a spectacular job and my catalytic converter for my diesel passed with flying colors. Thanks again guys"
positive,"I've been coming here for the past few years and its always a good experience. They are compassionate and kind, always looking for the best way to help. I'm very sensitive to being talked down to and have never felt disrespected here. They've always taken the time to explain the work to me. Recently took my car in for a check engine and a broken muffler pipe. They fixed my check engine light issue but they could only replace my muffler and not fix it. Instead of just quoting me the price, they directed me to someone who could fix my issue (instead of replacing) it for half the cost. They also didn't tell me what to do but gave me all my options. Always will take my car here."
positive,"I was referred to Ultimate Collision through the insurance company of the person who rear-ended me so I was hoping to get my car repaired quickly and wasn't expecting a lot of personal attention.  Despite the fact that I wasn't paying for the repair, Dennis and the rest of the team provided a great experience. The repair timeline was clearly explained and I was constantly kept in the loop on the progress. Dennis was also nice enough to inspect and buff out an existing scrape I had (not related to the accident) at no charge. My car was repaired quickly and looks great. I highly recommend Dennis and team and will definitely look them up the next time I'm in need of a body shop."
positive,"I had an excellent experience with all three of my visits to Choice Transmission. Dennis completed 3 projects for my on my old truck, and none of them were related to transmission work. They really are a complete automotive shop. I highly recommend their services."
positive,I had an brake booster issue with my EDGE.  I contacted Santan and they said they couldn't get me in for at least a week.  I called them again later that day and spoke with Jesus.  Jesus insisted I bring it in the next morning and assured me he would get the EDGE in that day.  He agreed that there is no reason I should have to wait so long for a serious brake issue.  I met Jesus (with the beard) that next morning.  This guy was professional and kept me updated through the process (4 phone calls) also they found out there was another issues with my vehicle due to a check engine light being on.  The booster was covered on an extended warranty and the additional work was at a very reasonable cost.  I just wanted my vehicle to be handed back to me the way it was prior to the mechanical issues.  I am so please with the work done and as well as the experience I had dealing with this dealership. More importantly I'm happy that Jesus took the time to listen to my concerns and worked to resolve them.  This is how all customers should be treated.  Thanks again to Jesus and the Santan team for all your hard work.  You have earned my business.
positive,"I've been looking for a good shop to service my truck that I use for my pool maintenance company. I bought it about 10 months ago and it's been a challenge finding a shop that really looks over everything when you get the oil change. Last time I got the oil change at a shop I won't mention I asked them to please look over everything because the truck is new to me and I want to keep it running and do any necessary maintenance to prevent issues down the road. Came back to pick it up and asked the tec how it all looked and he said great ! And nothing was needed. I was super happy because we're pretty tight on money like most people and if I didn't have to spend any more it was a good day ! Leaving the shop I noticed the low pressure light for the tires was on so I stopped by the tire shop  that was on the corner and I had a nail in 2 of my tires. So needless to say they didn't really check over everything. 
So speed up to this week, it was time for a oil change and noticed my brakes where sounding really bad so I knew I needed to get it in soon. Every time I came to a stop the sound got worse and worse so now I'm afraid to drive the truck so I parked it. I talked to my wife who is the finance manager at our house about what was going on and we weren't in a position to drop a grand on breaks and rotors plus a oil change so she had to figure out something because this is my tuck I make a living with. She noticed that Sears had a auto center down the road and we have a Sears credit card so we took that as a sign. I brought my 2007 Chevy 2500 truck into the shop and as soon as I walked in the door I was greeted by a nice guy that asked me what he could help with. I explained that I needed a oil change and my brakes where sounding bad so if they could check that out as well and if they could just do a general inspection on the truck for any other issues. By this time a couple of the guys from the back came out and asked me some more questions about what I was hearing do they could trouble shoot the problems better. I wish I had the young man's name that diagnosed my truck because he was super courteous and very professional. We left the truck there to go eat dinner and within two hours received a phone call from the shop explaining the issues that needed to be completed on the truck. They explained that the truck needed rear pads and rotors the differential fluid needed to be changed and the transmission fluid needed to be flushed. They gave me the pricing on all those repairs and they were actually cheaper then two other shops that I called just for the brakes. This was the best experience I've ever had at any auto shop and will highly recommend Sears at superstition Springs to all of my customers friends and family. I really hope that Sears reads these reviews and they find out the name of the young man that did the work on my truck and give him a raise he definitely has a bright future in the auto industry and he turned me into a Sears auto center customer for life."
positive,"Service Advisor Ricky Clark was the best. We had a check engine light for Throttle Body on the Sentra. Ricky initially quoted us the same price as other dealers but went above and beyond to win our business. Ricky was able to find other avenues and help reduce the price of a replacement throttle body for our Sentra. After service was completed and time of customer pick up, Ricky was still able yo reduce overall price with other discounts! Vehicle works flawlessly now and Service Advisor kept working with customer with pricing! Excellent Service Department and Advisor! Thanks you again"
positive,"So my paid off Kia Sedona started clicking and the check engine light came on right after a trip to ""Jiffy Lube"" I suspected it was bad news but I didnt anticipate how bad the news would be. I checked google maps because I saw that All Foreign and Domestic Auto Service was in my neighborhood and they just did some renovations to make the place look great. The reviews were what I needed to see. Ive been to other West Park places and well. I had new brakes that squealed too at low speed. Anyhow took it to All Foreign and Domestic. It turns out my engine tick was a bad bearing on a piston rod. There is something comforting about someone delivering bad news with an Italian accent. This was on a Wednesday. He quoted me a price for a used engine that was about the same low miles as mine. I did the math on a new car or a lightly used car and decided Id fix the engine.  He told me it would be there on Friday and the job would be done late tuesday. On Friday night he called me to come down to see the new engine in the frame getting ready to be installed. I went up of course. Totally amazing seeing this major surgery on the car. On monday at around 5pm I got a call ""Your car is ready to pick up"" (Yes, that was a day early) So they did a full engine swap out in two days. I waited two days where I have driven 300 miles to write a review but things are working perfectly. The engine is so quiet I cant even hear it. Also the rumbling I heard in my suspension was some heat shield (So that is silent and WAS NOT a huge suspension fix) Also my brake job squeal was diagnosed as cheap brakepads and that was fixed as well. My car is back, it is in perfect shape and was WELL taken care of by All Foreign and Domestic. Oh yes and the quoted price in the beginning was SPOT on at the end. No surprises and what I consider a very reasonable price for basically giving my whole car a major overhaul."
positive,"The crew at Jiffy Lube definitely saved the day! In this case it was moving day!
My room mate and I just barely made it to Jiffy Lube in the hopes that they could fill our transmission fluid since it had been draining fast for some reason or another. Not only did they offer to fill it for us for free either way, but when they saw how bad the leak was, not only did they fill our transmission, but they gave us two spare jugs of transmission fluid so that we could make it home. Not only THAT, but they also gave us directions to take the safer back roads across town, considering the condition of our car.  Saying that they saved the day is putting it lightly. I will always recommend the crew at Jiffy Lube. Thanks a bunch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"Good place with quality work. They squeezed me in on a Saturday early afternoon with no appointment, welded up a muffler and got me back on the road in under 30 minutes. Ill be going back to get our Jeep's exhaust done."
positive,This is a nice local shop. They got our car in quickly when it had a check engine light. They determined it just needed an oil change. They got the job done quick and their prices are fair. They even gave my daughter a lollipop when we went to pick it up.
positive,"I WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE NOW THAT I'VE BEEN HERE!!! What else can I say about these guys but their shop is one of a kind. Fast, efficient, friendly, helpful, and definitely are NOT there to rip off their customers.

I had some work done by a previous mechanic at another shop and was having some check engine light issues after the work was performed. Looked these guys up on Yelp and thought I'd give them a try after seeing the great reviews. 

Spoke with Tamra who was extremely nice and got me in as soon as she could. When I first got there I was greeted by the owner Phil. I let him know of my problem and he ran a free Diagnostics check (which by the way I've never heard of any shop doing). After some searching he found out that my spark plug wires were bad, all of which I was told by the pre-mentioned previous mechanic were replaced. He gave me an absolutely fair estimate but knowing a little bit about cars I decided to change them myself. He told me good luck and sent me on my way, did not try and upsell anything to me (which as you know with auto shops is quite rare). Upon replacing the spark plug wires, one of them was so bad it fell apart when tugging on it. Needless to say got those replaced but the check engine light issue still remained. Called up Litchfield Auto and again Tamra squeezed me in ASAP. 

Got there the second time and Phil and his mechanics again started a free Diagnostics on the car, mind you they closed at 6pm and I showed up about 4pm. Upon further inspection, he told me that the spark plug wires were crossed and fixed them, handed me my keys, again at no charge and told me have a great day. I couldn't believe the great service at this point so I MYSELF asked him to charge me a labor fee for these guys working on my car for hours between both of the days I took it there. 

Long story short these guys are EXCELLENT. I have never been to a shop that is this clean and that is actually concerned about retaining loyal customers and not just how much money they can squeeze out of you. Like I said before I know a little bit about cars and Phil and his staff are one of a kind. He took the time to talk with me about the issues and explain how things work with the car so we could be on the same page and never did I once feel like he was out to get me.

I will DEFINITELY recommend this shop to anyone I know and will go there for all my auto needs.

Thanks again guys for being there for the customer!!!!"
positive,"I came here for a state safety inspection. They were able to fit me in the same day without an appointment, which was nice because I was working from home with a cold that day, so it was convenient.

The shop office is a little dated with floor to ceiling wood paneling - but in some weird way, I really liked it. All over were posted old photographs of family, friends, etc, and I could tell there were a lot of memories and history in this place.

The inspection went fine, they didn't try to sell anything unnecessary to me, and I was given the same price I was told. Unfortunately, no experience actually getting my car repaired here, but based on this experience, I'd be happy to give them a try."
positive,"There is new owner. Very honest.   I sat waiting for my oil change.  The 2 people that were waiting both had issues with there cars.  One was an AC compressor that was starting to go and another was a muffler issues.  They filled the guys AC with freon for free and said he could probably make to the cooler months and deal with it later.  The muffler guy he said was fine for emissions and it was only cosmetic noise issue and see him when it starts to bother him.

I got my simple oil change as usually.  No air filter upsell like in those other places.

New owner is doing a great job."
positive,"These guys just earned my business today. Drove in because my check engine light was on they did a quick check on my vehicle and it was only a ""gas cap"" issue.. no charge and I was on the road in less than 15 minutes!! Thank You!"
positive,"If you want honesty, transparency, and expertise bundled up with a tiny bow on top, Whitey's is your new spot.  

It sucks getting your car fixed.  It sucks even more to have to find someone you can trust.  They live up to their reputation big time.  It's hard to not give them a review when you leave so here I am.

My throw out bearing on my 2013 Mazda 3 went out and I had no clue what it was.  Tarrance hopped in the car and knew the problem within a second of starting it.

He kept me in the loop the whole time and gave it to me straight when he uncovered the real problems inside the transmission.  It could've been doctored up the wrong way easily, but he took his time and made sure everything was done correctly.  He told me what was going on and in the end it was my choice how I wanted to go about it.  

My car shifts smooth as butter now.  Thank you Tarrance and everyone at Whitey's!"
positive,I have taken two cars here for transmission repair and both times was very happy with the price and repair.  I called them for a referral for a non-transmission problem and they said I could bring my car by their shop as they did expanded work beyond just transmissions.  They resolved problems two other shops overcharged for and did not fix.  Very honest guys here!
positive,"We were thrilled with the work at Red Mountain Collision.  Dealt with Jessica and Bob and both were a pleasure.  Jessica kept us well informed throughout the process.  Bob wrote the original estimate and with the exception of my muffler which also had to be replaced due to the accident, the estimate was spot on.  
I was able to schedule my repairs while I was out of town.  When the car was going to take an additional 2 days Jessica had the rental car all set up for me first thing on the morning of my return. 
Not only does my car look great, the day I picked it up not only was it detailed on the outside it was meticulously detailed on the inside. I had told my husband it didn't look that good on the inside the day we picked it up from the dealership.  
Do yourself a favor if you need body work done, go straight to Red Mountain Collision."
positive,"I cannot say enough good things about my experience at National Transmission. I had brought my BMW to the dealership, who told me that I needed a new transmission and that this would cost me $7300. Wanting a second opinion, I take my car to Brock. He determined that it was a computer/sensor issue, not a transmission problem. He explained the problem to me in detail. Following up with BMW, I took it up to the Shop Foreman, who later admitted that they were wrong. Brock went above and beyond to recommend a better place to take my BMW to get this issue fixed and even set up an appointment. THANKS BROCK!"
positive,"Was treated like a king when I went into service for a check up and got a very honest answers and they got me out of there quickly. I got a transmission update and a steering check and left satisfied! The whole service crew seemed like really nice people, the guy that helped me is named Josh and he did a great job! I'll definitely be back and recommend Infiniti on Camelback and plus on top of that they gave my car a free wash couldn't be much happier!Service Department rocks!"
positive,"There are blessings in this world that come in various shapes and sizes.  For my friend, Kathy N., it came in the way of Ralph and Frank at Pro Collision Center.  Without going into too much detail, Kathy got into an accident and had to get the car fixed.  Everybody's got problems, so I won't go into a sob story of Kathy's particular hardships, but she was admitted to the hospital via the ER with chest pain.  With financial constraints, medical issues, and as a struggling newly-divorced, single mom, she's had much to contend with.  The day of her hospital release--today, in fact, she rushed to return the car insurance rental and to retrieve her car at PCC.  With the stress and problems that my girlfriend was facing, (I believe) it was Ralph that came in his invisible superhero cape to facilitate the return of her vehicle and the settling of her insurance case.  HE KNOWS WHAT HE DID, and God bless him for it.  Trust me, word of mouth goes far.  Ralph went above and beyond normal customer service.  

Go to these guys!!!!  There's a certain basic knowledge of cars that all auto repair places will have, but will they be fair with you?  Will they work with you?  Will they take care of you?   A good, fair, and honest woman went in looking to settle her insurance claim and get her car repaired.  She could have easily been taken advantage of, and nobody at PCC needed to invest themselves the way Ralph/Frank did in her.  They didn't owe Kathy that at all; they invested themselves in her because they cared.  A good deed is never forgotten, and please consider this anecdote as you all peruse through yelp reviews on where to go for your auto repair needs.

As a close girlfriend to Kathy, all I could do was cry and join in her blessings for the exceptional service rendered and peace of mind given to my dear friend.  Of course, I'm writing this review second-hand, because Kathy doesn't have the access to do so, and I would never doubt her word.  Please don't doubt it either.

May this review serve as good karma for this place of business."
positive,"I wanted a fuel-friendly car and selected a cross-over type car. Very pleased. Mark definitely gets his role...No pressure and lots of laid back confidence. I would have preferred a manual transmission, but I'm more than pleased​ with my purchase."
positive,This place answered the phone on New Years Eve at night when nobody else did.  On top of that they are honest and could have easily told me I needed a new transmission but after a quick look all I needed was an axle.  I left my car with them for a week because I live in Phoenix and I was anxious about leaving my car in a different city but their clear communication with me made it easy. They are trustworthy. They even stayed up late when I picked up the car because I flew in from Phoenix at 11PM.  All of that and they didn't even charge extra even though it was NYE and they are mobile.  Thanks again for being there.
positive,"We travel Full time in our RV and tow our older Jeep Liberty.  Our previous neighborhood mechanic recommended we go to a Jeep dealer to get our transmission serviced and we decided, since we were in Death Valley are that Las vegas was close.  We originally called a different dealer to be told it would be a week before they could get us in.  We called Chapman based upon other reviews.  we were not disappointed. They gave us 3 options for times.  We chose one then the day before they called to confirm.  We asked directions which she provided.  
We arrived early and were immediately greeted by Anthony, our service advisor who listened patiently as we outlined our needs and issues.  He gave us a price and estimated time frame.  Offered us a place to sit with Wifi.  It all worked out as we hoped.  Repairs made, vehicle transmission serviced and LOF performed.  We left very happy and would go again."
positive,"Matt was a pleasure to work with for a muffler repair on a work van.
Got me in quick. Price was outstanding. I will take all muffler repairs for my fleet to this location.
Thank you for the outstanding service."
positive,"I had taken my 2001 Ford F 250 into Dave's a few months ago to find an oil leak that once i pulled into their driveway decided to stop leaking. Dave's crew gave it their all but couldn't find it and told me to keep an eye on it and let them know if it came back. Well when the leak came back so did I !! And they found it this time. It wasn't a ""cheap"" repair but due to the complexity of the leak and the work involved in doing the repair i can say ""I'M A HAPPY CUSTOMER!!"" 
I have now passed Dave's name on to my mother who is in need of transmission service and who I'm sure will test his patience but I know in my heart she WILL be well cared for. 
Thank you Dave!! and I will send you a few more family members if you think you can deal with them :0)"
positive,"Big Jim's is great. I took my car there for a transmission repair last year (after the guy at the dealership tried to be super sketchy and offered to do an under-the-table deal where he wanted to get a used transmission off the internet to replace mine) and it's still working great, plus it's under a 2 year warranty. The best part was that Jim took out a big transmission book, flipped to the page with my model of car, and showed me the exact parts that were broken. A nice change from most mechanics that list off a bunch of mumbo-jumbo technical terms with no real explanation. I really appreciated the simplified explanation of what was broken on my car. The repair was expensive, but... transmission repairs are expensive.  Then a few days ago I took my car to Jim for a brakes repair, after going to a different mechanic (I had wrongly assumed Jim only did transmissions) that quoted me a ridiculous price and was clearly trying to rip me off. Jim quoted me a price $300 less than the other place and explained that the other place was going overboard, and my car simply needed new brake pads & discs. He finished the repair very quickly and so far everything is working great with my brakes. Overall Jim seems like an honest guy who is great at explaining why your car needs certain repairs... and he doesn't try to rip you off with unnecessary repairs."
positive,"After another visit to Calanni's, I was impressed once again. Firestone had charged over $800 for a piston servo seal bore fix that wasn't even done and wasn't even done properly as well as leaving transmission lines leaking after befing towed to a TRANSMISSION SHOP THEY USE!! (A small claims against Firestone is being filed). They made promises that weren't kept with a rental car and had an attitude that a franchise controlled the market. Charlie Calanni and his team came to the rescue for the best price once again. I DON'T TRUST ANYONE ELSE BESIDES CALANNI""S COMPLETE AUTO REPAIR SERVICE, PERIOD! You know what you are getting when you go to Calanni's, quality, safety, price, knowledge and trustworthiness. If you are new to Lakewood or a well-rooted Lakewood resident, trust your vehicle to Calanni's. 

Don't believe the negative reviews that people don't show their faces. If they actually had an argument they'd show their faces."
positive,"This review is for the service dept - service from Karla G. I have had terrible experience with this dealership in the sales department, and would NEVER recommend buying a car from here. 

I recently price shopped transmission fluid exchange for my 2006 Honda Element, and I was surprised that the dealer was competitively priced with independent shops. Concerned about the shops using the wrong fluid type or similar transmission issues, and that I had two outstanding recall items, I took my vehicle to Honda West with an appointment. The service from Karla was great, informative, and spot on. My car was serviced and completed prior to my estimated completion times. 

My only concern that I need to address is that they advertise on their signage when you pull up $39 Synthetic Oil change, but I noticed my service tag was for 3K miles with standard oil."
positive,"My entire exhaust pipe, from my muffler back to my catalytic converter, was missing.  The screw things (flanges?) had rusted at both ends as well! 

I couldn't afford a whole new exhaust system, at $1,500!

Hot Rod Scott was able to replace the portion of the pipe that was missing, and weld it at either end directly, without having to replace the flanges (assuming that's the correct term!) For $300....score!

The price was great and it should last me 5 years, since I don't drive that much.

They were very quick too.  Less than an hour!

They also do custom and performance muffler systems, and a lot of repair shops send clients here for exhaust and muffler work!

I highly recommend these guys!  Thanks for saving me $1,200!  SERIOUSLY."
positive,"This is a brand new Auto Repair Shop, I think it used to be called something else, but it's brand new owners and the staff here is WONDERFUL!!

We first got an oil change here a few months ago - $11.99 for your basic oil. WOW.

We came back to get our brakes done. I had received a quote from Pep Boys for $500 which included brake pads and new rotors for the back. Here they did it all for $300 and threw in an oil change with the synthetic oil. BARGAIN! And it only took an hour for everything.

We also have a check engine light on for a problem with one of the engine fans. They first ran a full diagnostic which is $49.99, free if you do the repair there. They were able to get the check engine light to come off, but in a re-cycle of the car's engine the light came back on; they felt so bad they didn't actually end up charging us for the diagnostic after all. They even called around to junk yards to try to find us a used part, but no luck. We are going to have to have the entire fan replaced, but we'll definitely be doing it here. The staff is so nice, they are honest and have the best pricing in town. I give them 5 stars all the way!"
positive,"Chris (service) was very nice. After driving my 2012 nissan altima from socal it overheated and caused major problems with the transmission. I called Nissan praying they could help me since my car was still under warranty (friday) I spoke with Chris who was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. They processed me in and out in 20 min maybe less, giving me a rental until they could figure out the problem. He called me to let me know they had to replace my transmission. I am really grateful they were able to do all of this in 24 hrs and the total level of service and professionalism from their staff. Good Job!!!"
positive,"CARS did work on our Jetta in the past and everything always went smoothly. More recently they did a quick repair (computer for the transmission) on our Porsche 911. The car wouldn't go into gear right after we had it detailed for sale. Someone was coming to look at it in a few days which put us in a bind. CARS diagnosed the problem, ordered the part, made the fix and got us up and running in time for the car inspection. We remain friends with buyer and he has had zero problems after the fact.

We will take our BMW M3 (see the German trend?) there when it needs work...although we hope that doesn't happen soon."
positive,"Just like everyone else, I was drawn to this place because of their cheap prices. It took me a while to find the place because Apple Maps directed me to Fort Apace and Peace Way. I called the shop and Marlene has been very helpful in giving me the exact location (behind Arby's on northeast side of Fort Apache and Tropicana). 

After getting my car checked, it turns out I needed more than just an oil change to get done. Chris took the time to explain what needs to be done with my car (transmission fluid, power steering fluid and coolant flush). Due to those, my oil change which is supposed to be $25 (5W20) came out free. They also offer free oil change or 10% off when you write a yelp review and it's good for use that same day :) 

Even though I came out paying for more than I was expecting, I am satisfied with the customer service, the prices and the short wait time. I definitely recommend this place and I am coming back for my next oil change."
positive,Wow! I will definitely be coming to this shop for all my car service needs! I drove around from shop to shop and everyone wanted to charge me $50-$100 to see why my check engine light was on after describing to them what was happening with my car. I went to USA and spent 10 seconds describing it to Chris. He said without doubt it was just my battery and the best part is he didn't charge me to do a 5 second test to make sure he was correct! I couldn't believe everyone else wanted to charge me almost $100 to tell me I needed a new battery! Chris and his staff were amazing and had 5 star service. It's a relief to be able to fix your car without the hassle! I will be back!!
positive,"These guys made my VW Eos fun to drive again. Had insane problems ( check engine light on, speedometer glitches, fuel tank showing empty when full, sudden gear shifts, etc.) which I had deducted were a problem with my ABS module. As of the time of writing this review I've driven to Cali and back. Mostly drove around for the heck of it, about 14 hours total... Drove right to California with my top down to ""test"" the work done. Wow. I cannot describe how great these guys will treat you. Eddie took me into garage and showed me all the gorgeous vehicles there. It was a cargasm. I was quoted an absurd price by the VW dealership and was almost ready to give up my beautiful little car. But, damn; these guys reminded me why I love my car so much. I would recommend going here if you love your car, and want to save money on the maintenance it deserves. I cannot wait to come back to get my dash system put in. I'm coming back Eddie and Moe!"
positive,"I just went to Tim as my check engine light came on on my recently purchased 2005 Toyota Corolla. Tim took a look at the code and told me what the problem was. Reset it for me and told me to call him if it comes on again, all free of charge in just 5 minutes. That is why I like Tim and will recommend him over anyone else, especially for old cars, the guy is very honest and will only recommend what is best for your car and your situation. Not making you spend money when you don't need to."
positive,"I could not be more satisfied with Pete's.  Unfortunately, my '06 Exploder had a serious transmission issue.  At first I thought that the needed repair was related to an insurance claim from a few months back.  While the needed repair / rebuild was not related to the previous claim, Pete's Transmission came HIGHY recommended by the repair shop and my insurance company.  While I was given the opportunity to have my vehicle towed to my own shop of choice - I took the recommendation.  

The repair was completed as planned.  My telephone calls asking for updates and follow up of the repairs and improvements were addressed with details and patience as I have just about ZERO knowledge of transmissions!"
positive,"Never had a problem with servicing my car here. Been here about 6 times for numerous things. I had my check engine light on and I pulled it up to the service bay. The guy came out and hooked something up to it really quick and told me that it's just cheap gas that had a high oxygen level. They didn't charge me and I was in and out in 5 min. My oil changes had no issues and when my tranny went out, they fixed it the next day and paid for the towing.  The tranny was under warranty but it still nice that I didn't come out of pocket for a thing."
positive,There is a reason I'm loyal to VW. And this dealership solidifies my commitment to staying with VW. I drove up today from LA and found that my check engine light went on. They were swamped but took me in to look over the car. Within 2 hours I was out of there with enough fluids and understanding that the car would make it back to LA ok. The professional way I was treated from start to finish was outstanding. Jeffrey was the service manager who not only went out of his way to fit us in but also was a joy to deal with.
positive,"Went in today for a smog, ended up getting a oil change, then got the transmission flushed of 121000 miles of nasty fluild. The 2 workers were so helpful, curious and I left with a smile because Jimmy and Alex being so helpful and caring about my issues with my car. I will be back the next and every time my car needs anything that they can take care of. I have never had a better experience having to do with my car and that means alot. Thanks guys you are the best!!"
positive,"WOW, what a difference from my awful experience at the last Transmissions shop (check my reviews, be very aware of that awful shop). 

Pete... was very helpful on the phone. Stayed late so that I could drop off my Bronco for a transmission rebuild. Price is great! Service Great! This is how you treat customers... 
Thanks again Pete for raising the bar for Quality Transmission repairs in the Valley!!!
J
Update...Feb 2016 great job. Very happy.
Update... Apr 2018 still running great!"
positive,I took 2 different vehicles here Toyota 4runner for rack and pinion and Ford transit connect for transmission. Both times these guys have taken care of me when others quoted high prices they always came in under and my first choice when taking a care in. Hats off to national automotive for their honest and dependable work.
positive,"Honesty is a rarity in this day and age so when I have dealings with an honest business  man/woman I wanna shout it from the rooftops.

In this case the honest man is Brock, owner of National Transmission on 14th street N.W. This man has bent over backwards and stayed past closing time to resolve our work truck issues.

He is as honest as they come and I consider him to be an expert in his field so if you have an issue with your transmission and don't want to pay a ton and have your tranny problems resolved Brock would be the man to see.

QUICK NOTE WHEN LOOKING AT SATELLITE PIC I SEE THE CORRECT ADDRESS BEING 343 - 14TH STREET N.W. LOCATED BESIDE THE REGAL BEAGLE PUB."
positive,"Was in from out of town and had a check engine light on my 2014 SRX.  Set up a service visit on the web site and received a call confirming a slightly different but acceptable service time.  Good communications from Jessica Hartman, she was responsive and professional.  Showed up at the dealer, was greeted promptly and courteously by Roy who listened to my description of the issues then got the vehicle in right away.  I stayed in the comfortable customer waiting area for about 2 hours while the techs performed scheduled routine maintenance on the car and replaced a part in the intake of the engine that showed faulty on the diagnostics.  The car was cleaned inside and out which was really nice given the long trip it had just been subjected to.  I don't get to praise car dealers very often however the folks at Earnhardt earned it with me.  I have no experience with their sales department but can certainly say the service department is top notch."
positive,"Bastone was able to get my car into the shop the very day I was out looking to get my car repaired. Carl, the man who assisted me, was very friendly, addressed all my concerns, and called me with an estimate before doing work (front end and alignment). Compared to the horror stories you can read online, their prices are very reasonable. I picked up my car a few hours later and the steering is tight, dead-center, and hasn't felt this good to drive since I bought it. I will definitely be returning if any other problem with my car arises. Nice work guys."
positive,"I just had some work done at this place on my town car - a 1997 silver Lincoln wih 110000 miles on it.  The first place I went to said the transmission was bad and it would cost about $1,750 to fix it.  Well I said forget that Ill just drive it until it drops.  Then I took it to Econo Lube / which is now a Meineke - and the car runs amazing.  I had it fixed for $150 and was out the door in 1 hour.  These guys are great.  I took my other car in for an oil change.  Excellent"
positive,stopped in while getting my car repaired very friendly place I had the number 4 combo taco and gordita combo.  Very tasty.
positive,This place is my savior! Nicest guys ever and they don't try to screw you. Nissan dealership tried to charge me 740 for a new muffler! This place saved me 600 dollars and had it done in 30 minutes first thing in the morning. My car is perfect! Very satisfied with the service
positive,"I have been her two times. The first time my check engine light came on, it scared me. I had a test done at Auto Zone to see why the light came on, they said it was something to do with my gas tank. I then took my car to Lindsay Auto and instead of charging me all this money to do test and look at everything, Sean the owner said most likely i had a faulty gas cap, he wanted me to try it out for a day to see if the light would remain off, and it DID! very thoughtful of him to think of the cost for others. 
       Just a few weeks ago my boyfriend ran over something and it cut a large hole in his gas tank, they looked at his car right away and said the whole tank needed replaced. The car was a 2013 so we thought for sure it would be a lot because of the year, but Sean then made the effort to find a used one and we didn't have to pay much, and didn't have to go through insurance.  I never had an auto service that treated me like a family member. i recommend this place to all my friends and family, very trust worthy."
positive,"All I can say is WOW!!!! Wish there were more stars I could give these guys! If you're looking for a place that you can trust to service your vehicle, look no further. We had been servicing our vehicles at Towbin for years and recently had an issue with the transmission in my daughter's Jeep Patriot. We tried another dealer who basically told us nothing was wrong with the vehicle so we went back to our friends at Towbin. 
JR and his team took exceptional care of my daughter. John, the shop foreman, drove the car with my daughter and of course it didn't make the noise we had been hearing. But instead of dismissing her like the other shop, he kept the car for the day and assured my daughter they would test the car a few more times to see if they could duplicate the problem. John was amazing and explained everything in detail. On one of the rides, he took the transmission tech who immediately diagnosed the problem.  Eddie who helped my daughter with a loaner vehicle was awesome. Communication was excellent, everyone promised they would contact her when they had an answer and she received a call before the end of the day.  Parts were in stock, repairs were started immediately and she had her Jeep back sooner than expected. Kudos to JR and his team - quality service on your vehicle and exceptional customer service. I highly recommend Towbin, they will take great care of you."
positive,"Just moved to Vegas and my check engine light came on.   Stopped at the dealership with hopes they could see me.  Lisa in the service dept. could not have been more helpful.    They got my car in to see what code it was showing and then set up an appointment to get it repaired.  I needed a new 02 sensor.   The service department was immaculate, courteous and professional.  The car has never been better.   Everyone here was so helpful from getting me a water to showing me where the waiting area was.   They all seemed to want to help and work together."
positive,I had an issue with this dealership in the past but I decided to give them another chance after talking to corporate. I went in the other day because my check engine light was on. Greg and his team were very helpful. They let me use a loaner car over the holiday weekend and resolved my dilemma.
positive,"I've been to CARS on two separate occasions, once with my wife's 2009 Volkswagen Tiguan, and once with my 2016 Chevrolet Colorado.  My wife's Tiguan's check engine light came on, and the mechanic shop I was visiting recommended CARS to me since they specialized in German made vehicles.  After talking to one of the owners (Eddie I believe his name was) on a Saturday (I just showed up and he was doing paperwork on the weekend, but the shop isn't open for business) he advised I bring the car back on Monday for a diagnostic.  After he diagnosed the problem, I did some googling and found that it was a known issue with the make and model of her car, and that VW would perform the repair for free.  While Eddie didn't earn my business for this issue, his correct diagnosis earned him my business in the future.  Points to them for their professionalism.

For my second visit, I brought in my 2016 Chevrolet Colorado to have a K&N cold air intake installed.  Moe said they normally work on German cars, but that they would gladly install the intake for me.  It didn't take them long to complete the installation, and the billing for their time to install the intake was fair; best of all, my truck sounds great!  This shop is honest, and fair, I will definitely be back to CARS again for anything I need for my truck, or my wife's SUV."
positive,"Dropped my car off for an oil change on the fly. Tim was very nice over the phone and was able to schedule me same-day. This location is very close to the 55 bus line so I was able to drop off my car and still make it into work on time! Great price, $26 out the door for my oil change w/ inspection and tire rotation. This location is open until after 7p making it ideal for office zombies in need of pick ups after 5. I'm very impressed with the friendly service I received. As a woman, I worry about the myriad of ""problems"" that will be found when I leave my car somewhere for a simple service. Tim called to express a concern about my muffler. After a quick chat and more detailed inspection all was deemed a-ok and he even left a hand written note to let me know all was well. I'll certainly be returning! Thanks the great experience."
positive,"When I take my car in to The KAR Shop I'm comforted in knowing it will be taken care of and this time was no different. At my last service, Kris recommended that my motor mounts needed replacing and boy was he right! Not only that, when replacing the motor mount they discovered that the transmission had one severed bolt and one on it's way out which they took care of. What a difference this made! My car now drives like it's new again!"
positive,"These guys did a fantastic job transforming my Infinity G37. They installed a new cold air intake system, high flow cats and exhaust, coil overs, larger wheels and tires and did a dyno tune. Mike did a great job helping me select the correct parts and made sure everything worked well together. Picked up 40 HP and the car handles and drives like a sports sedan costing many more $$ than I have into it. Had a small glitch with a check engine light and Rich was right on it the next day and took care of it. Would HIGHLY recommend this shop. For what was done to my car the pricing was fair and a great value. Maybe not the cheapest but you get what you pay for and these guys are worth every penny. I will definitely be using Dyno Comp for all my performance car needs."
positive,"I had my SUV  transmission  repaired at Litchfield Auto and they are the most professional & honest auto repair shop that I have ever done business with. They assessed the problem, gave me a firm quote and delivered the car back to me on time as promised. Highly recommended and if you ever what to contact me about the  quality of work they preform please do so @ smeekers@msn.com."
positive,"Service Department - Took my Prius in when the check engine light came on and was helped by Dan.  We had just bought the car from a different Toyota dealership a month before.  Dan was friendly and helpful, had a small problem with the gas cap fixed and even provided a complimentary car wash.  There was no charge and we were very happy customers!"
positive,"Great customer service but needed a push to get it. 

Not going into all the details. They ran into an issue with an oil change. Didn't take responsibility for the problem. Went home, did some research online and spoke with a auto repair shop owner, found out the issue was most likely (60 - 70%) was caused by the shop. Contacted Big O HQ on their website. A few days later, got a call from Ryan, the manager,  offering to take care of the problem. We arrived at a mutual agreement. They fixed the problem, even added Freon to my ac no charge, and my next oil change is on the house. 

One more thing: I didn't care for trying to push a transmission flush. I suggest anyone thinking about it research it first. It can cause more problems then it's worth. If your transmission is working fine, the fluid isn't real dirty, not slipping or acting up, you probably don't need it. I'm not a mechanic, just passing along what I found out. 

I'm very happy with the final outcome and how it was handled. Just wish they would've taken responsibility at the beginning, even partly would've been nice. Hence the 4 stars and not 5."
positive,"Phil (owner) is awesome. He truly cares about servicing your vehicle and not only that, but educating you on what services he performed and why he performed it. Labor cost is average and compared to other places you go, the service here is definitely worth the labor cost above all other repair shops I've been to. I used to take my old 2000  Camry down here that was just a ticking time bomb on when something new was going to go out. Whether it be a starter or just my check engine light. Phil kept that baby running all the way up to 275k miles until I made the personal decision to upgrade vehicles. Keep it up LP auto repair! It's not just the work you do, but the extra service and care you provide! Much appreciated"
positive,"I was in town for a funeral when my check engine light came on I called 2 other Honda dealerships that were closer and was told they could not help.  

Called Sunnyside went out of there way and scheduled my vehicle in the next day.  They found the problem fixed it and had my vehicle back to me in a few hours.  The service department did a great job.  If I lived in the area I would only consider using them."
positive,"It all started when my check engine light started flashing while taking my eldest son to school. Being the procrastinator that I am, I typically like to wait until I cant anymore but just with driving a mile round-trip, it was more than obvious something was *actually* wrong with my car. When I called The KAR Shop, Kris (the owner) answered & when I asked how busy they were & if it'd be possible to have my car looked at fairly soon, he informed me that the sooner I could get it checked out, the better (apparently flashing = BAD). Not once did I feel like I was being taken advantage of due to my lack of knowledge relating to cars (I'm sure many females out there can relate!) but Kris was extremely accommodating and drove me (& my other son) home so that we weren't stranded there until they were done! He also assured me that I'd either have my car back by the time I'd need to grab my older son from school or I'd be provided with a rental, which definitely helped alleviate some anxiety relating to the situation. Turns out I needed a new cylinder and I also had them replace my passenger window motor that had just started having issues a couple weeks prior (and it was all done before school got out!). If I ever have any issues again, I know exactly who I can trust to do quality repairs at a reasonable price with phenomenal customer service!"
positive,"Definitely a 5 star rating. I first went to Dave's Car Care about 6 years ago with my Isuzu Amigo. I had 3 other mechanics diagnose an issue that I had with it because it wouldn't pass emissions. My gut told me that they weren't diagnosing it correctly so then I took it to Dave's. I felt real comfortable with the diagnostics and the price. I went ahead and had them service my vehicle and it passed. Most recently I had a transmission issue with my truck. I had them install a rebuilt one in the vehicle. Unfortunately, it went bad after about 26 months and was no longer in warranty. Thank God I had it serviced at Dave's. They assisted me in purchasing and installing another rebuilt transmission at a fraction of the original one (even though the warranty had expired). I've since referred them to my friends and have been a loyal customer since. I will continue using them and highly recommend them to everyone."
positive,"My husband and I found this shop from yelp. My husband's car broke down on the freeway and he had to find somewhere to tow it to asap. We've both had mechanics here and there but never a place that we were really satisifed with...until this place. The owner Alex is amazing! Not only does he know exactly what he is doing, but we have never felt like we were getting ripped off. We now bring both of our cars there and have referred friends and coworkers to him. 

This is a mechanic who gives you his personal cell phone number. A mechanic who has actually driven to our house to look at our car when that lovely ""check engine light"" came on. 

We will never take our cars anywhere else. It's so rare to find a mechanic that is trustworthy in Las Vegas. 

(also FYI - the shop's address didn't come up when I entered it into my GPS....it's basically off of lakemead and 215 in henderson. Just call for directions)"
positive,"I brought my newly bought used car into C&S Auto, that I would use for my Ubering, that I bought from a seller that said ""Everything is like new""...they lied. The motor was loose and about to fall out the car. C&S fixed this but then AFTER I found out there was another hidden issue. The seller cleared the check engine light to fool me...I was burned by a local seller. I am not rich so this hurts everything I've worked for and effects my future. C&S understood my situation and made a deal to take money off the total price to help me out. They really care about their customers. I highly recommend them to anyone."
positive,"My car didn't pass the smog so took my car here to see what the problem was looks like my transmission needed to be replaced, I didn't have the money to fix it so he did what he can to buy us some time awesome guy really helped us out the lady in the office is super nice I will take my car back for any problems finally found an honest mechanic"
positive,Took good care of me and kept me in the loop with my transmission problem went above and beyond. Excellent service
positive,This is the place you have only heard of in dreams. A place that genuinely cares about the customer. We had taken in our 2016 Dodge Journey for a check engine light and when we explained the problem they suggested taking it into the dealer because it would likely be covered under the emissions warranty on the car. Just the fact that they told us that was awesome. I know we will be coming here again with any issues we encounter with our car. Thank you guys for being a stand up business.
positive,"March 2014 update:

I took my 2010 Escape to Whitey's for an oil change and have them check for a leak.

The tech did the oil change and found the problem with the transmission, which only shows up when the Escape is traveling.  The Whitey's tech asked if I had power train warranty, as I purchased the Escape at Auto Nation Ford; the Escape came with as Ford Certified which is power train for 75,000 miles of 5 years, so I was covered. The Whitey's tech told me there was a Technical Service Bulletin on this issue and that I should go to the dealer to get it fixed under warranty. 

The staff at Whitey's then printed out the Technical Service Bulletin for me to take to Auto Nation Ford!  

How many shops have this level of technical competence and then send you someplace else to get it fixed?

Auto Nation Ford  fixed the problem which was exactly as Whitey's found it.

I am happy with Whitey's. I would never take either of my SUV's to any other shop, unless they send me to the dealer. :-)"
positive,"So happy I found mechanics I can trust! I have taken my car to Superior for a new starter, brakes & tires in the past. They do great work & are honest, affordable & fast. Recently, I took my car in for what I thought was a transmission or some other major issue. It turned out to be a minor electrical problem that just needed to be reset. They took care of that at no charge. I could not be happier with their service. I highly recommend!!"
positive,"I can't tell you how wonderful Jack was. I had a $900 estimate from my dealership. A friend told me to talk to Jack. I needed a transmission flush and a tune up. $900!!!!! Talk to Jack, and after 2 full inspections (because he couldn't understand why the dealership wanted so much) he called me with an estimate for $350!!!! They were nice and very professional. Thank you so much guys!"
positive,"This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  

The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!"
positive,I have all the work done on my cars at lifetime automotive.  recently i had to take my truck in cause the transmission was going out.  The Owner went above and beyond to find me many affordable options to replace it.  this is just one of may reasons i love this shop and the people who work there.  they are honest and there prices are the best.  Thanks lifetime automotive for taking care of my vehicles and for the awesome service at a affordable price.
positive,"Chris Aizpitarte is AMAZING! He knew exactly what the issue was with my car as soon as I told him what it was doing! I had taken it to my local Nissan dealer in July when I first had this issue and they just blew me off! 
My transmission needed to be replaced and he had it all done very fast! Brought it to the dealership on Saturday morning and it was done late afternoon on Monday!"
positive,"We are very satisfied with our service here! We worked with Brian K - he took his time with us, explained everything in detail, called us with updates, patiently answered our questions, and got our car back to us much faster than we expected. I highly recommend this shop if you need to have your car repaired. The service was excellent, and our car looks incredible. I also really appreciate that Gerber offers a lifetime guarantee. I know it is unfortunate to have to have your car repaired, but this is a place you can really trust!"
positive,"I recently went to this Autozone because my check engine light was on.  While I was waiting to be helped, I had noticed one of the employees outside helping an older gentleman replace something, maybe a headlight.  When they were finished, I noticed they shook hands and the customer left very happy.  Then, it was my turn.  I told the employee, Randy, why I was in and he immediately came out to check the codes.  While we were out there, I mentioned to him that I wanted to address this issue so I could then fix the whistling sound I was hearing from the engine. Randy immediately asked me to pop the engine so he could take a look.  Within a minute, he identified the problem.  Without my asking, he said he'd be back & returned with a replacement hose, installing it for me.  It was then that I realized this type of service was just protocol for Randy.  He truly enjoys helping others.  A side benefit is he is the reason why customers will return.

Many times when visiting autoparts stores, it seems to me that the employees are disinterested in helping their customers really understand and resolve their concerns.  Their role is to solely identify the correct replacement part and sell it to you.  After this, you are on your own.  

If you are lucky enough to visit this Autozone while Randy is working, I am confident you will leave a more informed & satisfied customer.  Thanks, Randy, for putting in the little extra effort that makes a big difference!!"
positive,Have to say Pete knows his transmissions.  Had my avalanche in and out so quick for about half the price elsewhere. Friendly people who you can tell have been here doing this for a long time. Quoted a price over the phone and no hidden fees. The other transmission place I went to said they would have to actually take my tranny off to give me an accurate quote. They quoted 2000-3000$ which is a big gap. It was 1150 out the door here at Petes  It was the holiday and they still had it done in 2 business days. And I also had a complicated payment situation which they made easy and painless. Thanks again for knowing what great service means!
positive,"I needed an oil change and went back to Superior Tire since they did a great job last year w my alignment at a fair price for a lifetime alignment.  Thomas got my car in pretty quick even though they were busy.  After about an hour, he told me there was an issue he wanted to show me.  He brought me back to check out my transmission seal leak, but didn't pressure me to fix it that day.  He gave me an estimate to fix it and just let me know it needed to be done.  No pressure to fix it 'today' (and it seemed like a fair price).  While he also gave me an option to replace the front axle (since it was only a small addition in time and price), he didn't try to push me into fixing it (only pointed out the benefit if I chose to fix it ).  Thanks Thomas and the rest of the team at Superior Tire."
positive,"My 9 year old Hyundai decided to give up in a parking garage.  Big Jim was the recommendation of AAA once it was determined I was beyond their services.  Big Jim talked me through my transmission problems, found a used one that was a perfect match, and gave me options of investment vs. results. He was easy to talk to and kept me updated on progress.  He gave me straight answers when I asked about preventative actions moving forward (spoiler: northeast winters are an inevitable death sentence).  Vehicle drives just the way I'm used to.  I will definitely be bringing my vehicle back - exponentially better than the dealership I dealt with back in NJ.  THANK YOU"
positive,"My boyfriend and I decided to stay here for 4th of July weekend, and overall it was a great stay. Check-in was super easy and fast. Parking is $14 a night which kind of stinks but it is less expensive than other hotels in the area. They don't tell you that there is a fee; I only knew from reading reviews online so beware of that. I had no problem with the parking lot. You use your room key to get through the gate and there were plenty of spaces when we were there. 

The room was very clean, spacious, and updated. There was a microwave and mini fridge which was nice. Our view was of a rocky rooftop so that was kind of a bummer, but we weren't expecting anything spectacular. 
Housekeeping came everyday and were very good. We ate breakfast there twice, but didn't get there until 9:15 so there wasn't a crazy selection left but decent enough. There was cereal, oatmeal, sausage, eggs, bagels, english muffins, and cinnamon rolls which were delicious.

One of the main reasons why I chose this hotel was because they have a shuttle which drives you anywhere within a 3 mile radius (which is pretty much anywhere since everything is so close). We used the shuttle the first day to go to station square which is only 1 mile away. It was quick and easy. Around 10 pm we called the hotel to have the shuttle pick us up, and he told us that the transmission broke on the shuttle and it's not running anymore. Ok, no big deal, we just took Uber back. The next day we asked about the shuttle and found out that another hotel was working with our hotel and we could get picked up by them. They arrived quickly and we got dropped off at Point State Park. We called our hotel again around 10:10 pm (the shuttle is supposed to run until 10:30), and asked if we could get picked up. The guy was like ummmm the shuttle hasn't been running all day. So I explained that earlier on in the day we used the other hotel's shuttle. He knew nothing about that and again we were stranded, so we took another Uber. If the transmission broke then fine, but I have my suspicions that the transmission didn't actually break and the driver just wanted off for the holiday weekend because it just seemed like pretty convenient timing and the van was only sitting at the hotel after it ""broke"" for the holiday. But who knows.

The location of the hotel is awesome. There is a Domino's on the same street and and gas station/convenience store as well. You can walk 2 blocks down and you are on E Carson St which is where all of the bars and restaurants are, so you don't have to worry about transportation back from there because you can just walk. 

We were going to stay at the Wyndham instead of this hotel because it would have been convenient for the fireworks but chose this instead because it was cheaper, parking was cheaper, they didn't have a microwave and fridge in the room, and based on reviews the rooms seem to be cleaner here. I would stay at this hotel again definitely, I just wish there was more of a view of the river at least from the room we stayed in. But overall it was a very good experience."
positive,"So I have been to a few of these Firestones and Jiffy Lube type places with my company car because of the fleet services preferred vendors.  I have been to both this Firestone location now, as well as the one on William Penn Hwy just down the road a bit.  These two locations are not created equal in my experience.  If you want a good, trustworthy Firestone to go to, I say go here!  

I had just had my car into a Jiffy Lube for a check up exactly two weeks before I had to come in here... they said everything was fine, did what they had to (change oil and filter) and sent me on my way. I do not expect them to find every little thing but when they said they did what the Fleet company had asked, I assumed that they looked at some of the other basics.  My check engine light came on Thursday (just 13 days after this) and I had to get it in somewhere.  I remembered that the Mall had a location (at least I can go get lunch and walk around if it will take awhile, right?).  The location on William Penn Hwy was fine but after I had my experience with this one, I will be loyal here... they were able to fix something that the Wm Penn Hwy location could not and was not willing to (a terrible sound of a loose heat shield). 

They got me in right away, kept me posted on where they were at with things, looked at the whole picture of things, dealt with my Fleet company, and fixed something that I was told could not be fixed.  The few staff that I had interacted with were so helpful and nice too.  This made what was an annoying experience and unforeseen problem/stressor better. 

I will definitely be taking all of my service here now as I cannot complain about anything."
positive,This repair shop gets a+. My uncles suv is having transmission problems. Jim took my uncle out with him for a test drive to see what was happening. I'm so glad Jim is a straight shooter and my uncle is 80 years old and he didn't bs my uncle and take advantage of him like other shops do. I talked with Jim about the pros and cons of replacing the transmission or let my uncle just drive it until it breaks. The suv is a 2007 and the cost of a new transmission was almost the value of the value of the suv. We decided to hold off on the transmission    I highly recommend talking to Jim if you are having transmission problems. He's a straight shooter we need more repair shops like this one.  Kudos Jim
positive,"Had an appointment to get my transmission oil flushed 9am, dropped car off at 830am.. Got $25 off from Yelp! But also offered other coupons they offer..
Met with The store manager John Trent & he was great!!! I have an older car 2005.. Its normal to always be skeptical when going in to mechanic shops, bcuz they try to Rip you off... NOT THIS PLACE.. 
Ended up also getting my rear brakes, drums etc fixed cuz I had trust in this place.. Let you test drive car after work done, showed you hands on, no BS.. 
Highly recommended..
Also.... This store has the cleanest bathroom that I have ever seen in A mechanic shop!!!!!"
positive,"My review is about service, not sales. I have no information about the sales side of things. I was in town with my husband on a business trip. I had my car serviced at Carmax in Inglewood, CA before heading to LV. Carmax said everything was fine, they replaced some valve (that turns out probably didn't even need to be replaced), and the engine light went off, so we headed out for the trip. Well, it was not fine. The engine started racing at times and then would drag horribly to the point that 18-wheelers were passing us going uphill. We were worried about getting stranded in the dessert in 110 degree temp with little to no cell signal and towns miles apart. We finally made it to LV, and I called a Dodge dealership the next morning to have them check it. I happened to call Chapman and talked with David Richards.

David was awesome. He told me that I needed a new catalytic converter (which Carmax cleared the signal on and obviously didn't test drive it to find out if it was fixed and therefore it didn't get replaced) and that the Carmax service person installed the valve wrong, which is why the check engine light came back on. I called Carmax corporate and told them the nightmare of what we had gone through. It was a really long, painful story. She was helpful. She understood the seriousness of the problem that we experienced and got some managers on it. They called me, and they worked with David to take care of the check engine diagnostic fee.  Chapman replaced my cat (which most other dealerships I talked to in the days prior didn't even keep in stock) under the Dodge warranty but still wanted their diagnostic fee. I understood but I wasn't about to pay it since Carmax had screwed me. The big wig at Carmax in CA arranged payment to David (all they had to do was put a pin in correctly to seat the valve), and Chapman had the cat replaced in a jiffy. I couldn't believe it.

I'm grateful to David for all the support and working with Carmax and to Chapman  for all the rides to and from my hotel. We had no trouble on the way back to Los Angeles. I hope I never have to have service again while in LV, but if I do, I know where I'm taking my car."
positive,"Prices are industry standard $95/hr. The difference is if nothing is wrong with the car they won't charge anything. I've been going here since 2012. Several times I've got estimates for repair work and on at least two occasions check engine light was tripped for nothing and they didn't charge me. If your having difficulty diagnosing a problem and don't wanna spend the $ take it here. If you tell them about a problem and take it in for an oil change they will borderline advance diagnose your car for you to find the problem wo charging. They catch problems other shops don't. They explain in detail what's happening or why some parts are preventitive maintenance. It's been a nice place to frequent, the atmosphere is really friendly and unlike other businesses in the area everyone is welcome no matter where your from."
positive,"My check engine light came on a couple of weeks ago. I went to two autozones and they could not read it. Came here and they did.

I always thought that O'Reilly's had more experienced people working there in general. I still do!"
positive,"$7.77 cheapest smog check in town. They also check out your car for maintenance issues but there's no pressure to repair anything they find.

Wait is a bit long, but that's what happens when things cost less. Show up early or be prepared to wait about half an hour.

Tip: if your check engine light is on you will automatically fail the smog check. Take care of that first. Just clearing the codes at Autozone can work. Or take it to Panda at Desert Inn and Jones."
positive,"2 Cars/2 Transmissions in less than a year.

Brothers and owners, Brian and Kevin have replaced the transmission in two of my cars.  One done in Spring, 2012, the other, February 2013.  I've had 2 excellent experiences. 

I had never heard of them before but pursued them upon a recommendation.  The second time I needed their service, I met their dad who gave me a little bit of background about the shop he started years ago.

Brian and Kevin grew up learning from their father who started his Fairview Park transmission business back in the 40's. He had  to relocate and the shop has been in North Olmsted for years.

To top it off, Park Auto Clinic's price is excellent.  A family member had an estimate of 1,600 dollars from another shop.  I told them to go to Park Auto Clinic--a couple of hundred dollars cheaper-- great work--dedicated family-run business.
 
These guys have worked on transmissions all of their life and that's all they do.  They are experts.  

By the way, they had both my cars done within three days of dropping them off.   And, with both of my cars, they asked me to come back within 3-4 weeks to make sure that everything was working well.  

These gentlemen are some of the most honest, nice people I've ever dealt with.  I can't say enough about what a great experience I've had twice with Park Auto Clinic"
positive,"This place did a fantastic job.  Every single person I spoke to here was friendly, welcoming & courteous.  The process to have my car repaired was streamlined & it was ready 3 days earlier than they estimated.  My car was hit by someone with Geico insurance.  This was one of their preferred repair shops.  In house Geico inspector & Enterprise car rentals.  They fixed the damage, replaced my bumper, did body work above my fender & passenger door.  Repainted & matched the original paint perfectly.  This process couldn't have been easier.  Robert was great too.  Thank you!"
positive,USA Auto get the job done efficiently and they will treat you respectfully never have I been hustled like in other places I am coming back to do transmission and coolant services thank you guys
positive,"I was first introduced to Joe's Auto Avondale, AZ by a flyer advertisement that came in the mail. At the time, I needed to get a transmission service and a fuel injection service. They had some coupons in the advertisement for the services I needed. The prices were amazing compared to the GM dealer. I arrived at the location 10/30/14 to get the services completed.  One of the managers Taylor provided excellent customer services, he was knowledgeable to answer my car service questions, he was up front with the costs associated with the job and they are efficient and work quickly. This place offers such a great value at an affordable price. I was very impressed with my first experience. Joe's Auto is a simple family owned auto shop with 5 other stores in Arizona. The storefront is clean, they have some chairs to sit while you wait, a nice TV and free WIFI if you ask. 

On 11/4/14, I was back to get my check engine light checked out to diagnose the issue. Jeff had checked me in and processed my service. He provided awesome customer services, was knowledgeable in answering all my questions and it was a personable experience.  I ended up needing an intake camshaft actuating part for my engine since the hydraulic mechanism was non-operational. It was a dealer only part so they had the part delivered within 45 minutes and the job was completed in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Again, I was very happy and impressed with my experience here. I highly recommend taking your vehicle here for future services. Why pay more at the dealer when you can support a family owned business and get your vehicle services done at a reasonable price. Keep up the great work guys! To the owner - Keep your employees happy and take good care of them because they are clearly running your business very well. I will tell everyone I know about my experience here and share all around social media. Thanks!"
positive,"Ok. So, that tranmission thing is important. If you don't check on it every year, the fluids and all that jazz, it could go very wrong and if your tranmission blows, it can cost a whopper to fix. So we must be preventative. But I'm the luckiest girl in the world. My Dad maintains my car for me. He winterizes it. He has a solid relationship with a local mechanic when the job is more complicated then he can do (and my Dad can do A LOT!). My Dad's work is basically fixing up cars and selling them. He knows cars. And my whole family drives 90's vehicles (we're old school!). But we take a lot of pride in our cars!

My Dad uses National Transmission.
So I use National Tranmission.
Now that I'm a big girl, I take my car there myself.
I call them up and usually talk to the ever-pleasant Brock at the beginning of the week.
I say I need to have my transmission serviced.
Usually they do it on Wed, Thurs or Fri morning, I think. Or maybe that's when you can get fit in easily. Usually it'll be at 9 or 10 AM. They need it for a good 1-1.5 hours. So I drop it off, walk into Kensington for a coffee, return and Voila! Magic. Done. Reasonable. Friendly.

You certainly don't have to fear looking after your car with places like this. My Dad trusts them and my Dad knows cars so I feel good in recommending this location!"
positive,"Ewing has a customer for life in my husband and I. We went out to Red Rock canyon for what we thought would be a quick drive. Hadn't been off roading recently but we were going to check out an easy run. Pulled off to the side of a trail and husband tried to engage the 4 wheel drive. After a small struggle to engage the gear, we lost all tension in the 4 wheel drive and lost any gears in the normal transmission. We were afraid we had blown the transmission completely. As we started counting dollar signs of repair in our heads, we flagged down some park workers who said they would send a ranger out to us. 20 min later, a ranger found us and called in a tow. Based on where we were, a flatbed wasn't going to work. A four wheel drive wrecker was the only option...at an estimated rate of $275 an hour...and a 2-3 hour wait. Being 2:30 already...we resigned to being in it for the long haul. The ranger came back to let us know that they found a wrecker to be there in an hour. Thank God!

As we enjoyed the scenery of red rocks and big horn goats, we eyed the wrecker coming up the trail. Jon showed up with a great attitude and conversational spirit. He could have easily just strung the jeep up and pulled us back to town but...he problem solved with us. Luckily, a fellow jeeper stopped by and offered help. Turns out transmission was generally fine, we just busted the 4 wheel drive cable. Jon was able to leverage the cable back to the 2H position and we DROVE out of the trail...thousands of dollars saved. 

Jon will be getting a Christmas gift from The Bennett's this year."
positive,"Friendly guy @ the service dept. My check engine light was on so he made sure he checked everything out including recalls on my 09 Kia borrego and had them all taken care of. Dropped off the car b4 11am car was washed and ready @3pm, for dealership wait time that's not too bad. My car is under warranty so it was no charge but now I know a service place that is knowledgeable and reliable for any of my Kia needs!"
positive,"We drove to Las Vegas on vacation from Los Angeles, which is a 300 mile drive.  During the last 60 miles, we noticed something terribly wrong with our Honda Odyssey and drove slowly on the shoulder until we got into town.  We first took the minivan to Sears Auto Repair, but they said we needed to go to a Honda specialist.  We next went to the local Honda dealer.  The mechanic hooked the vehicle up to the computer and said the code indicated that we needed a new transmission.  They proceeded to write up a quote for $4,600.  The vehicle is a 2004 model with only 89,000 miles on it.  Based upon all the positive reviews on Yelp, we took our minivan to James at Hondatronics.  James told us that the code said that there was a gear problem, but that he did not know for sure whether we needed a new transmission or not.  He recommended that we flush the transmission fluid a few times since it was extremely dirty and gritty, which cost us only $226.  He then suggested that we drive it around town, and that we stop back before we leave Vegas to make sure the fluid is still clean (which we did and it was).  Should we need a new transmission, James quoted us $3,300.  James suggested we drive home keeping the speed under 65 mph and the RPMs below 2500.  We followed James' advice and made it home safely without any problems.  Now we can drive the vehicle around town and see what happens.  We may still need a new transmission.  Only time will tell.  But the problem may prove to be only that we needed clean transmission fluid.  Imagine spending $4,600 at the Honda Dealership for something we may not even need.  James was honest and up front, kind and helpful, and we really appreciated all that he did for us.  We were really lucky to have found James, given that we were from out of town and did not know anyone from whom we could have gotten a personal referral.  But thanks to Yelp we found this gem!"
positive,"This is by far the best used car dealership in Las Vegas.  It takes a lot for a dealership (or any type of business for that matter) to portray exceptional effort and go the extra mile to accomodate any and all used car needs that Cartwright does. They have exhibited true humanity by being able to acknowledge, rectify, and learn from all past mishaps and discrepincies that they, unfortunately, conducted in the past due to circumstances beyond their control at the time. 
In October of last year, I purchased a used Mercedes in what seemed to be in overall good condition.  I test drove it and had all vital areas checked out to conclude it all seemed to be in good working order. The signing and over all initial mandatory purchase paperwork was rather smooth. November I ran into a ""hiccup"" with some questions on the contact and a couple minor issues with the vehicle that wasn't disclosed.  Two months later (December), my car began to have major transmission issues. I took it back in (again) to see what could be done to fix this problem, since it had only been a couple months. I will admit, I went through Hell and high water for about three months with them over various issues. I won't get into the specifics, but literally had never been through such a stressful ordeal to this caliber. I had enough and couldn't take it anymore and was ready to pursue legal action. 
Low and behold, I had called one last time in February only to find out that due to, great misfortune, there had been a lot of scandalous people that manifested a plethora of havoc and issues in various ways and had just been caught. 
I was assured that every employee that had previously worked there had been immediately terminated and the new plan of action was to correct all negative experiences/ issues with past clients to the best of their ability. They have definitely delivered on that promise. I have never witnessed a company go so out of their way to make things right with a consumer. It's truly shocking that a dealership could be humble enough to admit that, unfortunately, they were a tarnished company for a minute duration; but have the determination to right wrongs and continue to persevere. They certainly have with me and I would absolutely purchase my next vehicle from them and, with great confidence, recommend them to EVERYONE."
positive,"took my van to here after finding them on Google. they were able to see me right away and give me some info on what was wrong with it as the check engine light was on. After about half an hour, they found what was wrong and said they needed to take it to the dealer for a warranty part to be replaced and were going to keep it overnight. The next day after it was fixed, they offered to get the emissions tested for me also at the state station. Ben was great to deal with and explained everything to me during every step. 

I would recommend them for any of your vehicles needs. They do everything there. I have a new mechanic."
positive,I had a super positive experience with Alex. Another dealership quoted me 2k just for the transmission. At Camelback vW i got quoted 848 + tx and the regulator on my window was repaired. They were honest to me and updated me via email and text. I am so happy with them! Ask for Alex. They totally turned around my opinion of vw dealerships!
positive,"We had my daughter's car repaired after it was hit on NYE , and we needed it back by January 13 for her to go back to college in AZ. Many shops could not get to this job before Jan 21. Maaco was friendly, accommodating, fast, professional, and courteous. We elected to have it repainted as there was some minor hail damage prior. The 2010 Mazda 3 looks fantastic, they did it within the time frame they promised and even gave me a ride all the way to Anthem when we dropped it off! I highly recommend them. Everyone here is very professional and respectful."
positive,"First off, I want to let people know that buying a used car is a gamble.  Most used cars are as-is situations.  If you buy from a private seller you really are taking a big chance.
Getting back to buying from Four seasons Motor Company.  I purchased a 2013 Ford Escape from them on a Monday morning.  The price was right ($10,500.) and the vehicle looked in excellent condition.  I took it home and realize that it had a whining noise coming from the rear of the car.  After listening to the Noise out on the freeway I determined that I needed to call the owner Tammie the same day.  She immediately  connected me to Larry, He told me to bring the car in the next day. 
I showed up at 930 am, I met Mike and we both went on a road test.  He determined that the rear wheels bearings were bad.  We went back to the office and the Owner Tammie had Keys for a loaner car for me to take while they got my car repaired.  At 430 pm same day I received a call telling me that the car was repaired.  They replaced both rear hubs with bearings at the cost off $409.00 which they paid. 

This is truly great customer service from Four Seasons Motor Company for  my purchase.  I want to thank the owner Tammie and the staff Mike for showing that they are a first class operation.  Buying a car from them was a great experience and I would do it again.

Thank you

positive,"Top notch customer service!! I'm new to Las Vegas and researched auto places in my area and this place stood out. I got a full tune up and more (oil change, spark plugs, ignition sensor, air filter, transmission flush and airbag service). I'm very satisfied and highly recommend this place. I didn't have to wait longer than two hours. Must go."
positive,"AMAZING! We were driving through from Salt Lake to LA when our check engine light came on. Found this place via Yelp and we pulled in after the repair shop closing hours. But the guys were still there and were incredibly nice and ran diagnostics and stayed late to fix the spark plug misfire and ran full diagnostics and got us back on the road that evening. And, here's the kicker, the price was super fair. I can't recommend these people highly enough. Pulling into an unknown car repair shop is a leap of faith at the best of times, but a few minutes before closing on a Friday night with an unknown problem is a setup for disaster. So lucky we found this shop!!"
positive,"I NEVER thought I would give Van Chevrolet a glowing review, but I am!! I had a 2012 Camaro ZL1 that I took into service years ago and was NOT IMPRESSED by the service or lack of it!! At that time the service department could not have been less helpful and non caring!! HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED!! I brought my 2015 Corvette Z06 with a problem with the car jerking when I braked normal. I was assigned my Service Consultant Kevin Martin (EXCELLENT)!! I explained to him the problem gave him the fob to my Z06 and left in a car provided by Van Chevrolet. I heard from Kevin MULTIPLE times keeping in touch and filling me in on the progress. He called and told me that they found it was a transmission problem probably linked to the multiple computers onboard the Corvette. They found the computer system had to be reprogramed to fix the problem. Once that was done, everything was fixed and they even realigned my Corvette. I have NOTHING but GOOD THINGS to say about Van Chevrolet and how they took care of me and my Corvette! But in my opinion NONE of this would have happened without the EXCELLENT attention to detail by my Service Consultant Kevin Martin!!"
positive,Recently had my transmission replaced in my Corvette. Even though this was warranty work their team communicated with me every step of the way. They had my car in and out within 5 days and handled all of the warranty communications for me. They fought for a replacement and not a rebuild which is what I got! On top of all of this my out of pocket for uncovered items was well below their estimate. This is now my families go to from now on.
positive,"I told my wife to go and get the car checked out.  In all fairness, my wife's naïveté precedes her.  I've found that mechanics always 'inflate' their prices until I show up and challenge it.  While Damon found a number of issues that absolutely need to be replaced, a quote from $710 to something just above $500 isn't.  

I never had Damon as my mechanic - Chris always took careof my cars.  This time around, Marlene seemed very cold and not the friendly person I'm used to.

Consistency, as you'll find in my posts, is important to me.  I no longer recommend this place.  

02/22/2018 - responding to Andrew A's note:

It's a shame, but I'm happy for Chris.  Being new to Vegas it was hard finding a shop you could trust.  Chris made an effort to try and salvage what happened with my wife and I just couldn't get over what that guy quoted her.  I'm in sales for a living and I always try to be a straight shooter.  Aiming high to negotiate is expected but 40%-50% over what it should have cost was messed up - how do you go from $700+ to $400 in the space of 2 conversations?  The guy even tried to do the fast math on me like I was buying a timesh

Chris and Marlene are a great team.  Marlene makes USA like you're Norm coming in to aisle up to the bar.  Chris gives it to you straight.  I really should have given them a chance to make it up to me, but I was forced to go out of the way to get it done.

If Chris and Marlene open a new place you can count I'll be going back, but not until they get rid of some of the people at USA Auto.


Update 05/25
Needed a smog check.  USA's smog deal at $7.99 is the best in town.  Met with Big Chris, who pointed out some issues with my vehicle that were a result of going to an 'independent' mechanic in North Town.  The hoses that were replaced by the mechanic was done sloppy - corrosion had seeped out from the connections.  

Big Chris showed me the condition of my transmission fluid and offered to clean it up.

Now, let me rewind here.  John Summers, the former manager, and Marlene had reached out to me after my last post to set things right, but I had become gun shy after. They're effort to win me back was a $100 credit to any service.  I didn't think I would ever need it, but I mentioned it to Big Chris who gave Marlene a call and got it authorized.

Even without John Summers as the current manager (he moved on), Big Chris kept their promise.

I'm back with my favorite auto experts and will definitely back again.  Thank you for the experience!

Another update 07/18
Damon's in charge.  I took up John on his offer to have a fuel purge sensor engine light checked out.  I knew what the issue was due to my Fixd sensor that I bought a few years back.  

He honored the $100 an threw in  tire rotation and an oil change.  Now, I checked around with the costs to compare and found that while he was on the high side, he 'ate' it on the labor.  Here's why - he goes to the dealer for parts and I understand how cash businesses work - he has to mark it up in order to show a profit.  Classic effort to reward.  Fair is fair.  He goes to the dealer because it's not a 'what if' or 'lets try this' shop.  Prices are a bit higher from the dealer, but we know it works.

Fast forward 2 weeks.  Check engine light comes on.  I freak out - I'm leaving town in 2 days and taking the car to SoCal.  It's great on gas - better than my beast Infiniti that drives fast, but guzzles gas like a thirsty man in a desert.  He cuts me a deal.  Says, I'll take care of it now and when you get back from vacation, hit me up and we'll take care of it - I'll charge you for the part only.

Done.  I honestly declare that this is the best auto shop in Vegas.  Honest, straightforward and they'll do what they have to, to make you happy.  

Props to Damon.  He's the best there is."
positive,I called these guys based on the experiences of the previous Yelpers- which frankly sounded too good to be true. Thanks Yelpers! Scottsdale Muffler and Automotive really is as great as you said! I needed my muffler and tailpipe replaced. I dropped the vehicle off before they opened in the morning. They called me with an estimate within a couple hours of opening and the price was awesome and much lower than I expected. They had the vehicle ready for pick up by the end of the day and...here's the best part ----***** THEY CHARGED ME EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID!***** I have lots of work to be done on my vehicles and I'll be going back Thanks you guys!
positive,"I first came to Atwood European 3 years ago after taking my 2007 CLS550 to a local dealership (who shall remain nameless) after having a strong smell of gasoline around my car inside and out - and in my garage - after fueling.  The dealership assured me the entire fuel tank had to be replaced at a cost of over $3,500.00.  I authorized some other work at the dealership regarding an issue with my trunk not opening and closing reliably and decided to seek a second opinion about the fuel smell.  Fortunately, I was talking to a co-worker whose parents had been taking their cars to Atwood for years with nothing but satisfying results.  I took my car there and after inspecting the vehicle, Andrew and his team determined that in fact, my fuel tank was fine and that my fuel pump was leaking and needed to be replaced - a $280 part - and that repair immediately (and permanently) solved the problem.

Six months later, I was still having problems with the trunk from the dealer's so-called repair and was due for routine service anyway, so I took the car back to Atwood.  I ended up needing full rear brakes and front pads as well, which I expected as I was starting to hear the usual warning sounds when pads are worn.  Andrew and team were able to determine that the issue with my trunk was actually a problem with wires in the wiring harness that were damaged due to wear (a design issue with this car) and instead of recommending replacing the entire harness, they repaired the section that was damaged, saving me hundreds in parts and much more in labor.

A year later, I had a front suspension strut beginning to fail and I took the car to Atwood.  Andrew was able to replace the strut with a part carrying a lifetime warranty (something a dealer can't/won't do), and he even refunded a day of my car rental due to timing issues with when he could get the car repaired.

Last year, I had a complete transmission failure while on a trip in Sedona (on a holiday, no less) and consulted with Andrew after leaving my car at another small independent shop in Sedona (Redrock Precision Motors - I highly recommend them as well).  I ended up having them replace the transmission with a rebuild carrying an unlimited mileage warranty.

Most recently, my other front strut failed as I was leaving for a trip to Flagstaff to visit my daughter at college.  This time, it was a more dramatic failure, requiring towing to the shop.  When we arrived at the shop late on a Friday afternoon, Andrew's lot was nearly full - inside and out - telling me that business is good, but also signaling that it might take a while to get my car done.  One of his crew drove me to the car rental place so that I could get a car to continue my slightly delayed weekend.  They didn't have to do this, but offered to because they knew the car rental shop was slammed and would take a while to come get me.  When I came back to town on Monday, I checked in with Atwood's answering service a couple times and was not terribly surprised not to hear back right away, knowing how busy they were.  As it turns out, their internet and phones were down on Monday and Andrew spent most of the night there with the service provider getting back online.  He called me back on Tuesday morning after getting all his messages and, much to my surprise told me that my car would be ready that afternoon if I approved the detailed estimate he gave me.  I arrived at the shop and everything was to my satisfaction - the work was done promptly and within the estimate we discussed by phone that morning.

I've gone a long way here to demonstrate a pattern - a pattern of dependable and honest service that I've received from Atwood.  I know cars very well - I have several (and have owned many more) and work on many of them myself and am not someone who could be easily deceived or swayed by a shyster.  Andrew and his crew have always been up-front and straightforward about all the repairs and service I've had done there - often going beyond the call of duty to save me time and money - and I will continue to be a customer for as long as I continue to own european brands."
positive,"The Key Tower stands at 948 feet tall in downtown Cleveland. The Terminal Tower is 771 feet.  People perch by the river valley in Tremont for pictures with the Cleveland skyline in the background. I encourage the reader to venture 10 miles south to Parma, OH and climb 500 feet in elevation to the highlands. There is a beautiful collection of television and radio towers there. Most are taller than the Key Tower and in my estimation it is a far more unique and interesting photo op. Wikipedia says that this grouping of towers is second only to Mount Wilson in LA. I stood at the foot of one of these hulking beasts today and almost lost my balance when I kept moving my neck to see the top. Maybe equilibrium was lost because of the tower transmissions burrowing a hole into my brain. I harken back to one of the greatest films of all time They Live by John Carpenter starring Roddy Piper. The mission of the protagonist was to stop radio towers from programming our population thereby destroying humanity. I am conflicted with the plot because I love these towers so much and would never want any harm done to them. Come check out the towers when you have a chance. Don't worry about RF radiation exposure. You will not be sorry.

positive,Great service and price!  Rob is a very straightforward honest guy!  I started going here awhile back and now I get all muffler work done here
positive,"Got my transmission replaced on my 02 Toyota Corolla. They gave me a great quote, and they even lowered it after talking to them more about my situation. They completed the rebuild very quickly and they communicated with me professionally and often, keeping me informed. They were so kind to me each time I was at the office. They definitely made a stressful situation a lot easier to handle. They have a good warranty, and are very willing to check anything if you think something is up or just for regular check ups on the new transmission. A bit out of the way from me, and not necessarily the best part of town, but I would definitely recommend them!"
positive,"Ok, I thought for awhile about what to say on Yelp about Hondatromics, and came up with a myriad of things.  I really want to keep this as short as possible yet be comprehensive about my feelings toward Hondatronics, and James and Nicole Bean, the owners.

I began taking an Acura RSX-S to Hondatronics (from here on out I will refer to this store as H.T.) when James and Nicole purchased it from Keith Doyle, who opened the store years before.  I was scared when James and Nicole took over as I had a few Acura and Hondas and was always pleased with Keith's work.  H was honest, professional, fair, and amazing. Since the new owners took the reins, H.T. His only gotten better.  On my 2nd visit I witnessed something which James said he honesty doesn't recall.  I lady was at H.T. To pick up her Civic. By the symptoms she outlined, James had prepared hermit the news that she, likely, needed a new transmission; and she was given an estimate of $1,800.  She had the cash in her hand when she entered the store, ready to pay. While waiting for a bit for James to come in from the service bay, we talked.  She said she was a 6th grade teacher, and was not prepared in the least for a new transmission, especially since educators are so seriously under-paid for the job they do. She was not happy, until James came in.  He told her that he was able to CORRECT the problem by seriously cleaning out her gears and changing out the transmission fluid, along with some kind of filter.  Her bill?  She owed H.T. A grand total of $78!!!!!  (And James had already begun apologizing that her bill was THAT much.). Remember that she had $1,800 in her hand, ready to pay!!!  After that visit, my feelings toward H.T., James, and Nicole were confirmed.  I WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, AND DEALING WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

Ok, that was a few years back, but the fact remain the same.  I have been back to H.T. probably 45'times since then.  I have always been treated with professionalism and honestly.  I haven't always liked hearing what James or Nicole have told me regarding what they found wrong or the price to fix it, but not once have I ever questioned their findings or the price to fix it.  They have always been straightforward with me, and always given me a price lower than EVERY other store that specialized in repairing Honda products.  I'm so happy to have found this shop and James and Nicole that I even asked him to repair my Honda lawnmower, but he politely declined .  

THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR SHOP DESERVE THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD, AND HAVE EARNED EVERY CUSTOMER THEY HAVE BY DOING EVERYTHING WITH HONESTY AND INTEGRITY AS THE FOUNDATION FOR THEIR  SUCCESS.  MY CARS WILL FOREVER BE HANDLED BY NICOLE, JAMES, AND HONDATRONICS.  

Recently I pondered the idea of a BMW for my next car.  I quickly changed my mind when James told me he doesn't work on BMWs.  Thanks for all the care and honesty you have shown me and my family over the years.  (And especially for talking me out of the Beemer.)"
positive,"The room is big, comfortable and well designed. Very spacious. I really like the buttons around the bed to open/close the curtains. Little green lights on each light switch so you know where they are in the middle of darkness.

The bed and pillow is a bit too soft for me but I still got a very good sleep.

The major issue is noise. I stayed on the 20th floor but I can hear car with big muffler or bikes cruising down the strip. My room is next to the housekeeping office and the staff likes to talk with the door open. I wish they can use better materials to sound proof the room.

I ate at the Tetsu Teppanyaki restaurant is the food is excellent. The Jean Philipe Bakery right next to the room-access elevators serves crepes, sandwichs, salads, coffee and everything you need for a quick meal. And the chocolate (though overpriced) is very nice.

I didn't play in the casino since I don't gamble but I feel this hotel has much less people smoking compared to others. $15 min for blackjack or roulette bet seems to be the norm there."
positive,"While driving on my way back home my car suddenly stopped in a place. I got out of the car and checked the exhaust pipe but found out nothing was wrong with it. I also tried checking the engine but could find nothing wrong with it. But when Leavitts Auto Care came, they told me in matter of minutes that the problem lay with the transmission machine and gave an instant estimate of my expenditures too. Since then, I have always trusted Leavitts Auto care for any work that involves maintenance and repair of my car. Their mechanics are really very good at diagnosing cars."
positive,Love the YELP check in $7.77 for a smog!!!!  I was in and out in less than 10mins. They were bz too!!!!  My husband brought his car here for check engine light and they told him which part he needed he bought it and they installed it for a decent price !!!! A+++++ service
positive,"We were on a roadtrip from New Orleans to Los Angeles. Vegas was our last stop and right when we literally got on the freeway to go home, my check engine light came on. This was scary because we were from out of town, and what if we went to a local mechanic and they rip us off because knowing we are desperately trying to get home!

Hondatronics saved our butts! We drove up about an hour before closing, and the super nice guy who was there (I forgot his name but I think he was the owner) said he would do the diagnoses of the check engine light. He came out the car and did the check (I drive a 1997 Honda CR-V with over 189,000 miles on it, and of course we had just driven all the way across the country). He said the engine was running lein, but we should be fine to drive all the way back to Los Angeles and turned the light off for us. He didn't mind that we obviously couldn't give him the business, he was just being an awesome nice guy and didn't charge us for anything. We got back fine and I've since had my local mechanic here work on the issue. 

This is a sign of a place you can trust which is why I am writing the review. If you live in Las Vegas and own a Honda, give this place a try!"
positive,I had a minor issue with my muffler. Needed to get it fixed ASAP and I am so ELATED that I stumbled across this shop. My experience was awesome from start to finish. Both Tamara and Phil were helpful and honest. I will not only be a regular customer but will refer anyone and everyone that needs auto work done.
positive,"This review is long overdue! I thought I had already written it, but apparently in the craziness of finals I forgot. Anyways, onto my review...

After driving back from California a couple months ago, my check engine light came on and my car was shaking like crazy. Upon referral from a friend, and after reading all the Yelp reviews, I decided to bring my car (Honda CRV) into Valley Automotive. Boy was I glad I did! I got an initial estimate from KC and his staff, but after doing some work it ended up that there was more wrong with my car than was initially thought. However, rather than me having to pay for the additional fixes, KC offered to foot the bill! I was shocked, but forever grateful! The thing that sets Valley Automotive apart from most other auto shops is they care about their customers and want to do right by them. As a graduate student with little money, I appreciate the honest business and work that KC and his staff do at Valley Automotive. I happily referred a friend to them so she could get a second opinion after taking her car to another shop. Valley Automotive saved her money and she was equally as impressed with the service she received!

Apparently my car doesn't like the Vegas heat (who does like 115 degree weather?!) and I noticed that it is leaking coolant. I will gladly be taking my car back to Valley Automotive and doing business with KC and his team again!"
positive,"I was surprised when I came here because I usually expect to be upsold. Im usually given the song and dance that brakes are bad, shocks are on their last limb yada yada yada. When I came in today Jeff was a straight shooter. Got my oil and transmission fluid changed And he was honest and told me everything was good. They have windows to the shop where you can see the mechanics doing the work. Coffee, donuts and a nice lounge area. I like finding a place I can get work done that's trustworthy and Jeff (the store manager) is friendly and an asset to Big-O."
positive,"Came in with exhaust pipes rusted halfway off, was prepared to replace the whole thing. Guy welded new pipes on just past the muffler. Pipes secured now."
positive,"We've been taken our cars here for years and they've provided excellent service every time. We've serviced our Volkswagen Passat and Jetta here and they've done an honest job. Recently we purchased a used Volkswagen Tiguan and took it in for a $130 full inspection and the owner Frank called me personally and encouraged me to return the vehicle to the dealer due to multiple issues including the transmission which we ended up doing. He didn't charge me at all because they spotted the issues pretty quick into the inspection. I've never seen a mechanic be so honest. 

On another occasion we had a set price set up for a secondary air injector to be installed on my wife's Jetta and it turned out they were able to get a cheaper price on the part needed and lowered the cost that we agreed upon. 

I couldn't be more happy with the honestly and high level of service that Desert Car Care Chandler provides."
positive,"Nobody likes getting their car repaired, especially when the damage was someone else's fault.  These guys did a fantastic job on my Jaguar F-Type.  Casey gave me a comprehensive quote and completed the work right on time.  They made sure to repair it right, replacing the parts that needed to be replaced instead of repairing plastic parts like the insurance quote felt could be done.  I also had them perform a paint-less dent repair while the car was there, and the results are impressive, can't even tell it was there.  Car was nice and clean for pickup.  If you need repairs, stop searching, this is the place."
positive,"These guys rock! Quickest most affordable muffler, exhaust, and service shop around! I've taken them all my vehicles for years and would recommend them to anyone."
positive,"Our Porsche's windshield cracked due to a stone on the road, so the Porsche dealership in Vegas recommended us Chris from AGR Windshields. They got the new windshield ordered (porsche windshield specifically for our GT3 model,) and Chris installed it on a SUNDAY on labor day weekend (talk about service!) we were on a roadtrip so Sunday was the only day we would be in Vegas, so he really did us a huge favor. 
The end result looks amazing, Chris is friendly, professional, and a real detail-oriented guy. We were very nervous about a third party fixing our windshield (although recommended by porsche) but we couldn't be happier and you couldnt even tell we did anything. 5 starts!"
positive,"I have a 1991 VW Westfalia, with a Tiico engine covnersion (water-cooled Jetta engine, installed ""sideways"").

About a week after getting it out of the shop after the new engine was installed, the the pipe that connects to the in-side of the muffler cracked through. I took it to Mesa Muffler and they welded it up. About a month later it cracked in the same place again, and they welded it again.

Later, when my girlfriend backed the muffler into a dirt bank, it cracked the pipe clean through in the same spot. So I took it to a Midas (was out of town - it was my only option), and they installed a new muffler. A few months later the pipe cracked in the original spot. I was back home then, so I took it to a different Midas, and they welded it up, and added a new support bracket. That lasted a couple months, the the pipe cracked in the original spot, and the bracket they added also broke off.

Took it to a different Midas, and they installed a new muffler / bracket assembly, for about $240.00. About 2 weeks later, the entire muffler fell off while I was driving down the highway. :)

So I googled ""high performance muffler,"" and found Scottsdale muffler. Thank god. I spoke with Chris - gave him the whole story, and dropped it off. He called the next day to pick it up, and the bill was $180.00. 

The new muffler / mounting hardware is absolutely a thing of beauty. They fabricated a big flat double-mounting bracket, which is rubber insulated. I could not recommend them more highly!"
positive,"You can't ask for better customer service! I took a transmission here to change it from a 2-wheel drive output shaft to a 4-wheel drive output shaft. The price was very reasonable. Here's where the GREAT customer service came in:  I made a mistake on the type of 4-wheel drive output shaft that I needed for my application. Pete changed out the output shaft at no charge because he had already charged me for the first exchange. With that kind of great customer service, you can't go wrong."
positive,"I am not from the area and needed a check engine light to be looked up before I drove home. These guys took me right away.  I sat in the waiting area for an hour while many happy costumers went through.  JR was very friendly, honest and helpful with everyone.  I heard him tell people when they really needed to get something fixed or when they could put it off.  I even heard him consoling a woman who had just broken up with her boyfriend.  She was most worried that it might also have ended her mechanic relationship. 
In the end he didn't charge me for the engine code look up, and said it was fine to drive on.  He also did a great job explaining why the carburetor wasn't an emergency situation.  I could drive home and just see if it comes back on. They did change my oil, which was overdue, for less money than I usually pay.   
Like the previous reviewer, if I was reviewing a coffee shop I wouldn't give it any stars but this place was the best mechanic experience I have had."
positive,"We were lucky enough to find Quick Muffler this past weekend (they were open on holiday Monday!). Our muffler was in need of repair, and had gone to a big name shop for a quote. It was very high, so we thought we'd check out some other places. That's when we came upon Quick Muffler. They were fast, friendly, polite and half the price of the large chain repair!!! We were in and out in an hour, and were so very thankful. Highly recommend this great place! We will be going back for any of our auto needs from here on! Thanks Abe! You're the best!!"
positive,"Feb 2013 - P.S.  It's almost a year later, and knock on wood, but my transmission is still running fine.  I have not needed a new one yet!"
positive,"We have a 2000 Volvo, check engine light flashing. It turned out to be a complicated problem. At the end of the day Sammy and team came through above and beyond. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is I felt they could have called and kept us updated when they didn't meet their time commitments and It  took 3 different trips to resolve the problem and they didn't ensure the check engine light was turned off after they completed the work. They took care of us given our time and troubles. I felt they went out of there way to make the situation right. Exceptional! We will continue to use them and refer to people to them. Thank you Sammy!"
positive,"I took my car in to repair a dead headlight. The car has some other issues, but I only had an hour and frankly wasn't prepared to pay for the bumper and transmission work that it should probably have. But a missing headlight means tickets from the po-po, so you gotta sort it out.

I left my car with them, walked out of the shop, and realized that I had forgotten to ask how much it would cost. I'm still new to this whole car thing and make amateur mistakes all the time. I came back after an hour expecting to be reamed, but was handed a $19 bill. I know replacing a headlight isn't a big job, but $19 was waaaaay less than I expected. Pretty sweet.

Two days later my girlfriend was being cheeky, asking whether I ever got that broken bumper fixed. Playing along, I told her to look for herself. She knew I hadn't taken it to the shop - she just wanted to rile me up. But then, to my utter disbelief, we found that the bumper HAD been fixed. When Woodies replaced my headlight (for $19) they also reconnected my sagging bumper. They didn't charge me for it; they didn't even brag about it.

What the hell, Woodies. You are too awesome."
positive,"After having a transmission noise that was very difficult to pin down, their tech Andy was able to square away a tough situation. I was almost out of warranty when I initially brought it in, but with the help of Dave Drouin(my service advisor) and Dave Bartlett(Service Manager) it was covered even though it ran well past my warranty expiration in getting it fixed. Dave B in particular was very empathetic and even gives out his cell for texting purposes. Dave D was very prompt in getting me the updates to how my vehicle was doing and I would definitely recommend the dealership. Even Taylor, the loaner vehicle gal was extremely courteous. Once again, can't say enough about tech Andy. He was phenomenal in trying to understand the problem with the trans."
positive,I would highly recommend this dealership based on my recent service experience. The check engine light came on my 2014 Limited and I was getting ready to ride from Phoenix to California. The service rep. (Joe) took care of me. He identified the problem and found the parts at another dealership. Had the parts transferred and installed them in a few hours. They provided me transportation to and from my home. Could not of received better service.
positive,"I hate shops.   I really do.   I have never had a good experience at any auto shop I have ever been to.  I trained myself to work on my own cars so I would never have to deal will shops again. I recently bought a beater truck (1996 Dodge Ram) for work and/or hauling guitar equipment and what-not.   The truck barely moved.  I maybe got to about 30mph and it revved to about 2000....    I couldn't figure out what was wrong, so i limped this green monster to Desert Car Care. I was expecting the usual...  a phone call about an hour later telling me I needed thousands of dollars worth of work on my truck.  Not the case.   They called about an hour later and told me I needed a new battery (which I did) and they gave me the option to buy one my self and bring it to them (the cheaper option) or put one they have there in it ( the easy option).  After that was sorted, they called back again and told me my Catalytic Converters where clogged and needed new ones.  nothing else.   I even made mention of a possible bad transmission (that gave them an opportunity to screw me) and he said no.  the Tranny is fine.  Wow.   I couldn't believe how honest they where.  The truck was done the next day and he called me and told me to come pick up ""Truck-a-saurus"".  When I got there, the mechanic that worked on it talked with me about later work on the truck getting it to 100% as he is proficient in Mopar vehicles.   I will definitely be taking Truck-a-saurus back to Desert Car Care to get him 100%.   Nice work guys.  Keep it up.  This is how a business is supposed to be ran."
positive,"Stop by here whenever I need supplies for my car. It's convenient because it's located near my house and they have plenty of parking. The employees are pretty knowledgeable here and will assist you in installing batteries, windshield wipers, and other easy things that you can buy here if you need help with it. You can also get your battery tested or check engine light scanned for free. Pricing is pretty reasonable on most things and if you shop here a lot make sure to sign up for the rewards card where you get a $20 reward after 5 $20+ transactions in a 6 month period"
positive,"Just a few days ago my transmission started slipping a bit. Then on the 101 it started making some very nasty growling noises. Got into a parking lot and every gear acted like neutral; my transmission was TOAST!

Looked into a lot of different shops and was really starting to question if I should even keep my van or just get a new one because of the high costs everywhere I called for rebuilt transmissions.

I heard about Pete's Transmissions from a trusted mechanic. Because of their reviews on Yelp and a few other places I decided to go for it. 

When I called, Erica answered the phone. She was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions to my satisfaction. When she learned that I drove a van she immediately asked if it was a work van. I said yes and she quickly figured out what it would take to get it done as fast as possible so that I can keep working. My van is my office, warehouse, workshop and lifeblood of my business!

I had my van towed to Pete's Transmissions on a Thursday afternoon. Friday morning Erica called me letting me know I was good to go! Very good turnaround time! My transmission repair included a 12 month warranty and was HALF the cost of most other places I called!

When you show up at Pete's Transmissions it is clear that they know what they're doing and they do it well!
My old van is driving better than ever before!"
positive,I honestly love this muffler shop. I have been to three others and Scottsdale muffler has been on the ball with everything I needed. Not only did they do a stand up job of replacing my piping to 2.25 inches and adding a muffler. I wasn't quite happy with the volume so I bought a new muffler and asked them to replace it. They were more happy to do it and they also continued to update me on the progress. Amazing prices with amazing service. Scottsdale muffler is my muffler shop!
positive,"Great place.  Got a Groupon initially for a year of unlimited oil changes for $35 and it was so worth it.  I go every 3,000 miles and have so far been a half a dozen times.  They are thorough with my car and do an inspection with the oil change.  They gave me free estimates for a leaky transmission and the prices compared just fine with other places in town.  I have subsequently bought a Groupon for my friend as well."
positive,"I found myself needing a new transmission in my 2002 GMC Envoy two weeks before Christmas. I called Pete's and their price was so much lower than other places that I decided it was worth the drive from Mesa. When I called back to let them know I was coming, the transmission they had for me was already sold. Erika had one put together for me. She told me it would be ready at 8. When I showed up at 8, I walked into an office full of random pictures and art. Pete wrote up my paperwork while someone else loaded up the part. The price was exactly what I was told on the phone. I was in and out in 15 minutes. I will definitely recommend Pete's to anyone with transmission needs. This place is a family owned operation that has been done right."
positive,"Very professional and they have fair pricing. They make recommendations that are needed but aren't pushy.  The last time I was in they were able to get me in same day and it was exactly as they had quoted. In addition, they usually are finished before the time they estimated.  I've just stopped by for questions and they were very helpful and even added fluid  or reset check engine light at no cost.  They are super nice there."
positive,"Love this place I needed a new cat for my cadillac, and places were charging me ridiculous amount of money, Jesus and his team took care of me and it was fantastic service I highly recommend this place for anyone with their exhaust or muffler needs!! I will be back!!"
positive,"I have used this auto shop a handful of times and they are always super nice, super helpful and not pushy at all. Last time I was there was for a check engine light, they told me it just needed to be fixed before my next emissions test, which was a year out. It was an expensive fix so I am glad I have time to save up for it. They could have lied, like may auto shops have done before and told me it had to be done sooner than later, but they are honest! Thanks Whitey's!!!"
positive,"I had my truck (2002 Chevy 1500 Auto transmission) fixed at petes, great customer service,  unbelievable price (super low )trust me you will not regret it, the shop looks awesome, 
And they aren't bogged down with other non transmission repairs,
 I will only go to  Petes from now on and refer everyone to Petes transmissions, he will give you a great quote and a great price, I can't say enough good thing about Pete, but you are the man, thanks to Pete and his creww....."
positive,"I'm new to the Phoenix area and had car trouble on the I-17 during rush hour. My check engine light was flashing, which I figured was not good, so I checked Yelp and found Dave's. I chose them because of the reviews and also the fact that it is near my house. They've gained a customer for however long I remain in the area! I took my car in around 10:00am, they said it would be a bit before they could diagnose it, so THEY GAVE ME A RIDE HOME! By noon they called me and told me what was wrong, how much everything would cost, and to my surprise-- that it would be finished before closing the same day. They were friendly and quick. I highly recommend Dave's Car Care! Oh and the actual Dave (the owner) answers the phone at the shop. I thought that was a nice, personal touch."
positive,"""Been here a few times for smog and oil change they seemed pretty honest, so when my check engine light came on in my pathfinder I decided to give them a try. Needed spark plugs. I got a great price with good service. They included my passing smog and free oil change with the repair. The lady at the counter was pleasant and chatty. Good job guys. ""."
positive,"I was involved in a DUI Hit & Run and needed my bumper repaired. Ben R. put me at ease. He even explained to me how paint works differently on metal versus plastic, which is why my bumper is a slightly different shade that my body. I had never noticed, and I had been starting at my bumper a lot in anger over this accident! I'm pleased with his professionalism and speed, I was in and out quickly and feel good about getting my car repaired."
positive,"Everyone from the young lady answering the phone, the gentleman that assigned the technician and the technician Phil that looked at my friend's car were awesome.
We were driving from San Diego to Phoenix to watch some baseball when the check engine light came on and the car began losing power. Did a quick Yelp search and found this place with a solid 5 stars. 
If we could give them 6 stars we would! They diagnosed the car and assured us we were ok to finish up our trip just be sure we have the car fixed when we get home.
Thank you everyone at Litchfield Auto Repair!!"
positive,"In Solon on business and desperate for good food, I had the good fortune to stumble upon ""Harvest Kitchen and Lounge"".  I went back the next night.  And if I hadn't flown out the next morning I'd have been back again.  

On a busy stretch of road lined with muffler shops and fast food franchises (read ""food like substance"") it would be easy to miss Harvest Kitchen.  (I did and doubled back.)  You park out back and enter through the rear (that's where the hostess is).  The high ceilinged dining room is decorated in soothing colors.  Very airy, very well lit, and not over-chilled - no sweater needed.  It's a handsomely appointed establishment

Harvest Kitchen has fish, foul and red meat; pasta and vegetarian selections, a long list of enticing appetizers and a above average wine list.  I would say the menu's organizing principle is something like ""north Ohio locavore"".  They collect as many ingredients locally as possible, they even found an Ohio made pasta.  It shows in the taste.  I had the saffron angel hair pasta with shrimp, chorizo and vegetables the first night; the tomatoes, spinach and shallots really dressed it up.  The ginger shrimp and sesame noodles (with peas, tomatoes, basic and curry) was equally enticing.  

Harvest Kitchen and Lounge is Hands down the best restaurant in Solon Ohio.  That's not saying much, but Harvest Kitchen would generate positive notice anywhere - in Solon (an unexceptional, distinction free suburb southeast of Cleveland) it's a real stand-out.  Next time I'm in Solon I'll eat there every night - no point in looking further afield.  

Harvest Kitchen would rate at least four stars in any urban center.  But it a distant suburb like Solon it's five stars for sure."
positive,"I was referred to T Jay's by a colleague after a fender bender and was very happy with the service. 

Very friendly and professional. Their customer service was excellent - going above and beyond most businesses to accommodate me. The car looks and drives perfectly.

if you ever need your car repaired, I highly recommend checking them out."
positive,"Have had my oil changed here for years now on several cars. Always a thorough fluids/filters check. Basic stuff is priced right, but upgrades and some bigger flushes and systems services are a tad pricey.

I just happened to stop in today for an oil change after coming directly from the Cadillac dealership. Had been having trouble with a check engine light, rough acceleration, and a nasty rattling noise. 

Somehow the dealership could find nothing wrong and it drove fine for them, yet it rattled and ran rough straight out of their parking lot as I was leaving. Decided to go for an oil change and fluid check at Terrible's. Was in and out in about 30 mins. Surprisingly, it ran so smooth on the way home and didn't rattle either. My guess is the tech must have reconnected something that fell loose - maybe a vacuum line or ECM connection?? 

Either way, great job today as usual. I also come here regularly for car washes. 
TIP: if you buy a car wash at the pump (which you probably need anyways), it knocks off .20¢ per gallon on the gas price. Hard to beat."
positive,"Awesome service and very professional employees that are very helpful, first time here with my bmw, had my srs light and check engine light diagnosed, and also my oil changed. Eddie really knows his stuff, thought this place was too good to be true with complete 5 stars rating but it lived up to its reviews as you can see, would recommend this place to everyone who has a German or euro car."
positive,"I brought my e92 335i in to BMW for a check engine light. Jesse has worked on this car before and each and every experience is outstanding: always knowledgeable, always prompt, and the job is done right.  I won't let anyone else work on my cars. Good, honest techs do exist in Vegas!"
positive,"I have to tell Yelp about CARS. I am grateful for their quick, professional service and their awesome prices. I recently had the transmission on my 2006 BMW M6 go Bye Bye the hard way (pics attached) and CARS was there to get my car on the road again. I also had a 2001 BMW 740i that had a bad engine that needed to be replaced as well as some suspension work. I had a complete suspension rebuild kit and BC Coilovers installed. That along with a new engine installed at CARS have made my 01 Silver Bullet just like new. I couldn't be more happy with the results. 

Armando was the lead mechanic ( to my knowledge) on both cars and I have to give him a BIG THANK YOU. Moe is one of the owners and the gentlemen I worked with most. He is very fair and understanding and I would encourage any one that wants A+ work done but doesn't want to pay Desert BMW prices to call Moe. Eddie works the front desk and is always a delight to talk to. The whole shop has a very warm and inviting atmosphere as you would expect from a professionally run , family owned and operated business. I almost can't wait for my next major mechanical failure to go back and see them again.  Thank you all."
positive,"I had my check engine light come on and took it here. But it just ended up being the gas cap. I should've taken it to autozone first for a free diagnostic test rather than being charged almost $60. I called them again on a different occasion for regular oil change, but was told nobody does the regular oil change anymore and everyone offers the synthetic oil change anywhere I'd take my car to (which is not so true...) the oil change price is a little more than what you can get else where. I recommend Groupon for oil change"
positive,"I unfortunately had to get my car repaired twice in three years when I lived in Cleveland. Fortunately, Excalibur did the job, which minimized the hassle. This auto shop was recommended by my auto insurance, Geico. They had great service, explained everything and kept me updated, and made all the necessary repairs efficiently. They also vacuumed the inside of my car, which was a nice bonus. It was good to have the piece of mind, knowing that they would take good care of my car. 

The only issue I ran into, a few years later, was finding out that they didn't replace the rear bumper quite right, so there is an area where it doesn't attach as securely as it should. It does not affect the function of my car, but if I ever need to get the bumper replaced again (hopefully not anytime soon), I'll have to find a shop to do it correctly."
positive,"My car is old and on the verge of death.  The muffler fell off and I needed to remain road legal, so I came in and was helped extremely quickly without an appointment.  The gentleman showed me under my car and explained all the issues I had clearly, and gave me options.  What's more, he didn't try to oversell or lie to me to make a few extra bucks.

The price was fair, and I only had to wait around half an hour while they replaced my muffler.  I left without a hole in my wallet, and with a clear picture of what was going on with my car and roughly how long I had.  Very satisfied, and would return here."
positive,"I don't know much about cars or anything car related. I know that the vehicle I'm driving is getting on in years and is getting to the point where I'm worried if it will last. Found Liberty through Yelp and I am grateful for all your reviews as they held true.

I took it here to see what could be done with the check engine light. I was taken care of by Rashid. His service was quick, courteous and quite educational. I was given a decent quote for the service but had to decline due to lack of funds. He made me a deal that I might take him up on next time when I come back. Instead I just got my oil changed - about an hour or so wait which was great timing for lunch at L&L next door. We had some good conversation and I enjoyed my experience. Will probably be back soon."
positive,"I purchased my Nissan at Planet Nissan and that location has no idea what they're doing. I've had my transmission replaced twice with them and it was no fun. After I got my transmission fixed I went to Autonation to get a second opinion and since then everything has been great. I'm not going anywhere else. My advisor Chris is awesome! He knows what needs to be done and he makes it happen! 
I will continue to go Autonation for my oil changes and car repairs! Great job guys!"
positive,"Schorier was great to work with.  They fixed my check engine light / replaced my fuel pump that another repair shop installed incorrectly. They even offered to answer any of my hubby's questions since he wasn't able to be there.  They explained everything, were friendly and not pushy.  Would definitely return again."
positive,They were super nice. And I love this place but the prices are really expensive. I know you pay more at the dealership but the transmission tune up will be 400$ that is more than my monthly payment. That is why more people don't have VW.
positive,Ethical and expert. CM owns the best transmission shop in Phoenix. Ask him to blow the horns on his custom Beetle.
positive,"Finally, an honest mechanic!  Had my car towed to this shop three weeks ago after having thrown a tire rod and was quoted a fair amount for further repairs. Took my car in today and watched them turn down working on a transmission because there was nothing wrong with it!!!  What?!  Also, a discount for veterans...yay!  Great staff, thorough work and honest pricing!"
positive,"I was impressed! I had a coupon for a part synthetic oil change for under $20 (great deal). I know my car, so I know when people are trying to sell you BS repairs, I didn't get anything pushy here, just a rec to change the transmission fluid (which is accurate) only downside is that they are very busy on a Saturday. No appointment, you are leaving your car there all day. But hey, being busy is a good sign right? Also, appts have to be made DAYS in advance, not the day before like I tried."
positive,"My ""change oil"" light was on and I knew that I have been driving around too long.  I dreaded going and having to wait a long time.  I was passing by and seen the ""now open"" sign.  I drove up and services was quick!  The staff was very professional and Conner was attentive to our needs and concerns about the type of oil we were wanting.  We will be back to have our transmission fluid change!  Thank you"
positive,"While I did not actually get work done on my vehicle, I can attest that these guys are trustworthy. My vehicle's transmission began slipping several days ago. With some online research of my car (ford exploder), I feared the worst. Sure enough, Kevin from Park Auto called me and gave the bad news that my trans had failed and explained why. While his price quote to fix the problem seemed competitive to what others have paid for this repair, I decided that the it was not worth fixing the vehicle. Kevin also did a full inspection of the vehicle and agreed that with everything else that was about to need repair on the vehicle, it was probably not worth keeping the vehicle. 

Perhaps the best thing to happen in this crappy situation was that Park Auto declined to charge me for an inspection because Kevin stated they did not believe that charging every chance you get is how you keep returning customers. So just with that alone, they have earned my business next time I am inevitably in need of car repair. Good work Park Auto Clinic!"
positive,"My grandfather is a Ford dealer, but his shop is 2 hours away. Needless to say, I don't trust many people to work on my car (as I've been screwed by other dealers in the past!), but sometimes I just can't make the drive.

So when my friend Les noticed that my car was leaking transmission fluid (!!!) this weekend, he told me to call Kayser for an appointment. They were very friendly (no dumb girl treatment) and got me in as soon as they could. Thankfully everything was under warranty and didn't cost me anything. They had my car ready in less than a day. I would definitely take my car back to them."
positive,"Allstate Transmission and Auto Repair Inc., is the only transmission shop I trust to have my fleet of Ford E350 vans maintained and repaired. 

They explain your options and work hard to get it right the - first time! They give you accurate estimates of the cost and the time it takes to work on your vehicle. I am glad to know that quality comes at a reasonable price!"
positive,"Tempe transmission went above and beyond to help solve my transmission problem and did it reasonably fast keeping me informed all the way.
I strongly recommend them for any owner of heavy duty pick up truck that has transmission problems"
positive,"I backed into my trash can and bent the muffler, I also needed an oil change. Henry was so helpful and they were very accommodating, had me in and out within an hour, and I was able to work on my laptop as they had a desk and free Wi-Fi. Exactly what a busy lady needs. I'll be coming back for sure!!"
positive,"Going to a new mechanic to get your car repaired shouldn't rank up there with public speaking and first dates, but it usually does.  Well not if you go visit Tim at Walter's.  They guys at Walter's are friendly, trustworthy, and treat you with respect.

They are a small shop so call ahead if you need major service, but where else are you going find a mechanic who actually suggests way to save money on the repair"
positive,"My family and I pushed my 2009 Nissan Altima pretty hard from San Francisco to Las Vegas and about 70 miles outside of Vegas, my transmission went into safe mode. Needless to say my family was beyond stressed out about this. The next day I took it into Nissan and Dario and his team were Phenomenal! I explained my situation and he really with the extra mile. I can't say enough great things about Dario and my overall satisfaction with the customer service, professionalism, and efficiency of this branch. My family and I thank you for making our experience in Las Vegas and enjoyable one and not a stressful one. Thank you!"
positive,"We tried it based on Yelp reviews, and are we ever glad that we did!  My husband ordered the Pad Thai and asked for level 3 and the Papaya Salad at level 5 - ""Thai hot"".  I ordered the sauteed vegetables with garlic sauce (came with rice on the side) at heat level 3.  We loved what we ordered, although I will admit that next time I will order heat/spiciness level 2 for myself.  I have to commend them:  the spiciness was not just ""hot for hot's sake"", but had real depth of flavor.  I will also say that the mango smoothie we had for dessert was the perfect calming point for my palate.  The restaurant was peaceful, lovely.  We were at a bench/table.  One really neat feature:  There was a large group dining in the side area and there are pivoting glass divider panels that the staff used that really cut down on sound transmission.  What a great thing to have.  I agree with other postings, it is not inexpensive, but I thought it was good value for the quality of food, service, ambiance and location.  We will return the next time we are near Bally's"
positive,"Honest mechanics and they do more than just transmissions. Jim has replaced my clutch, brakes and fixed a dying water pump. This is a relatively new location but they have been in business for over 30 years in Las Vegas. I send all my girl friends here because I know they won't get screwed over. Highly recommended!!"
positive,"Small family owned shop but great at what they do (dad and brother both retired so now it's just Kevin I believe). We've had Kevin work on our VW Beetle for a few things and couldn't be happier. Super, honest, great guy. We were having a transmission slipping issue and called/visited several places. Those that would actually work on VWs said I'd need a new/rebuilt transmission. Called Kevin up and have him there basics and he was like ""oh yeah, it's probably doing this and this right?... I know exactly what wrong. It's probably just a valve body that needs to be replaced. See it all the time. You shouldn't need a new transmission."" Ran me about $1750 instead of the $3500-5000 I was quoted for a whole new transmission by several other places. Had it done in like 2 days. Even called me a week or so later to find out how it was running and if everything was still ok! Had something else wrong where he looked at it, said he THINKS it's X which would run several hundred dollars, but wanted another day to take a second look if I was ok with it. Called me the next day, said he finally found the issue and it was small, only like $150 give or take. Extremely honest and trustworthy. The only down side is he doesn't take credit cards (or at least didn't when I had my work done). But I'll figure out a way to pay cash or check to an honest, good mechanic over credit to a questionable/unknown one any day."
positive,I was really happy with this restaurant! We stumbled upon this when we were getting our car repaired and decided to stop and enjoy lunch. There were about a half dozen folks in there during the lunch hour and everyone seemed to be a mix of business and local families. Initially the service was really slow I'm not sure they were fully staffed but further into the lunch hour more employees showed up and everyone was a delight. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it! I recommend the shrimp!
positive,I recently took my car to National for a check engine light issue.  I was on a tight timeline due to the fact that I needed to pass emissions and register my vehicle.  They replaced my computer and took my vehicle through emissions to guarantee that there were no issues.  I am thrilled that they completed my work on time and for a great price.  I will definitely return again.
positive,Guys at Cars NV are awesome heard nothing but great things about the shop.  Brought my Mkv Gti in because the check engine light was on and the car was running sluggish.  They located the problem and fixed it quickly and for a great price!  My Gti runs so good now!  Pulls like a freight train again.  What really won me over about Cars NV was the amazing customer service & price.  Thank you Cars NV crew for the great service and experience see you guys next month for my timing belt/water pump install.
positive,"Excellent work at a very good price from this clean,  professional shop. Jesus had me in and out in 20 minutes. Outfitted my 1984 F150 with a  new high quality truck muffler that I would be unable to find at the price I paid anywhere else.  Glad I traveled all the way from  Cave Creek to  this great  shop.  Thank you,  Jesus!"
positive,"Hey trust me when i tell you....you will receive 5 star treatment at this midas on Bell road. Located only about 1 min off SR51 here in phoenix...it is you one stop destination for everything that is ailing your car, truck, van, SUV, or motorcycle. I remember when I first moved out here in Feb..I had some serious issues going on with my 1999 Jeep Cherokee classic. My wife and sister-in-law drove our Jeep from Chicago Illinois, more than 2000 miles, and I have to say it made it all the way with no troubles to speak of. 

However upon arriving in Arizona, i noticed a few days later that the check engine light was on....and i knew i needed to rectify any problems i was having with the Jeep before i took it for it's emission test out here. Well to make a long story short...being new out here i didn't know who to trust to fix my Trucks....also own a 2004 Chevy Colorado....and i had heard some true horror stories about how car mechanics try to swindle you out of thousands of dollars out here.

So since i needed an Oil change i decided to go to Midas and at least get that done since they were offering to rotate the tires as well all for only 19.99. While i was there i had them check out the check engine light...and check for anything else that was wrong with the Jeep  again before i took it for the emission test. I have to tell you it was the best decision i have made for my trucks since i arrived here. 

Bob Ostercamp who is the manager at this location has consistently given my great deals on all my automotive repairs. He is honest, direct, straightforward, and most importantly he cares how your vehicle runs. He has a great staff of certified mechanics and you can trust they will always do the very best job. This location gets a lot of repeat business because of all these factors.

So if your ever in need for honest, reliable, and great service please visit these guys...i promise you...you won't be sorry. Take Care my friends!!!!!"
positive,"I took my Beetle in because the check engine light was on. I scheduled it in the morning and they gave me a lyft home. They ended up changing and sensor and when the car was done they offered to get me a ride back to the shop. That night the light when off again and I called them in the morning and they scheduled an appointment with me at my conscience. The second day they gave me rides, just like the first day. It turns out a second sensor needed to be changed and they didn't charge me at all. The people who worked there treated me like family. Car troubles can be such a pain but with them it went so smoothly. I would highly recommend them."
positive,"My late-model BMW had a couple issues, because it'd been stored while I was in Europe for a couple months.  The battery had died, and the check engine light (""Service Engine Soon"") was on.  You can't get a car registered in Clark County with a check engine light on.  I took it to the dealer thinking it was all pretty routine.  The service rep at the dealer quoted me an eye-popping price just to change the oil and diagnose the problem (I'm talking hundreds, just to change the oil and diagnose my electical/emission problem), and I told him no way and drove away ticked off.  

On the recommendation of a friend, I called Fred.  He gave me a next-day appointment.  The place doesn't look like much, but Fred met me in the parking lot, listened to the problems, offered me a bottle of water, and said he'd have his guys dig into it.  3 hours later, my car was perfect again, and I paid less than half of what the dealership wanted.  Oil changed, problem fixed (corrosion on a connection), and check engine light reset.

But here's the kicker.  There was an issue where Fred said, ""You might have X problem (electrical/emission), and if so, it's going to be expensive to fix.  But we did Y, and l think it's OK now.  So drive it a bit, and if the check engine light stays off after a week, it's fixed; if not, bring it in.""  

3 months later, the car is 100%, and Fred's honesty saved me hundreds compared to the dealer.  Check engine light has not come back on, and I passed the smog check.

Changing the oil on a late-model BMW is a PITA if you do it yourself.  And the dealer charges a fortune.  Family Auto Care is about 60% of dealer cost and only about 10% higher than DIY, assuming you have the little special tools.  Fred uses BMW-spec oil and buys it by the barrel.  You can't beat that when doing the oil yourself, because the oil is spendy.  I ran the numbers and decided it's cheaper for me to have Fred change my oil than to do it myself.  Needless to say, we're talking about half the dealer cost.

You gotta have a reliable mechanic if you own a car you want to keep.  This hole-in-the-wall gets my thumbs up."
positive,"My baby decided to have transmission problems the same time my back went out.  Big Jim (and yes he is as big as his name) was more than willing to work with me.  He came highly rated from my mechanic.  
Now my baby runs better than ever before.  And it was half the cost of taking my car to a dealership for repair. - don't go anywhere else.  I learned my lesson"
positive,"Well it is a Midas.  Both myself and girlfriend have had work done on our cars here.  They are pretty honest and fair about prices and trying to help you out when it will be a large job.  They actually show you the parts and why it is bad. Paul the manager works almost all the time, and you can tell he cares about the location.

Small cons are the oil changes seem to be routine given the price and what is listed as the ""checks"".  Also our car was taken in with a check engine light and a specific part that would have cost $400 to fix at Midas.  After looking on Autozone.com the part was found for $70 and installed with one screw.  They had it listed as an hour part.  I was not happy to find this out.

Overall though one of the more honest repair shops."
positive,"I took my Beetle in because the check engine light was on. I scheduled it in the morning and they gave me a lyft home.

Car troubles can be such a pain but with them it went so smoothly. I would highly recommend them. 

Update: I took my car in again for something completely different but just like the first time the staff was really nice. If I could I would write them another review because this is a genuine group of people!"
positive,"The 'check engine' light went on in my Jeep, and after taking it to AutoZone to have the code read they told me there was a problem with my transmission. I called Allstate because they had such good reviews and they definitely did not disappoint. They got me in the very next morning, and even though the problem was actually not the transmission they explained what was wrong and told me where to go to have it fixed. He spent extra time to make sure I understood what was going on so that when I went to the dealership they wouldn't take advantage of me. Such great service, and I really appreciated them!"
positive,"I was on a road trip to Las Vegas from San Diego knowing I had 1000 miles left. I had my vehicle serviced about a month prior and clearly was not topped off during my service. I failed to get it topped off before my trip my mistake. I had several warning signs my car won't start once I run out of fluid. I came to autonation in Las Vegas and Jeffrey Lopez service consultant was so helpful and kind. He told us exactly how much to buy and showed my husband how to fill the tank. 

Jeffrey made our day and gave my husband recommendations on golf courses. He provided superior customer service and turned a unhappy customer to a happy one! He deserves kudos from management!!!

Not often to find a pleasant, happy to be at work on a Saturday very often!!!"
positive,"I had my car repaired here through my insurance. Had heard horror stories about repair/rental places not keeping you updated so as to trick you into paying for rental longer and other hidden fees. As you can imagine I was on edge going in, but to my surprise everyone was extremely friendly and quick! It was no hassle for me whatsoever and they kept me up to date on the progress of the repairs and let me know as soon as it was done! Would definitely come back for future fixes! Everyone I dealt with was professional and very friendly!"
positive,Thank you Tony and Noe for your great service. I took my 2004 Ford Explorer to Tony with a transmission problem. He was able to fix it and was able to have it ready before I left to California as a special request.  He was such a great help.  So honest and respectful. I won't think twice in coming  here for my next car repair.
positive,So I got screwed buying a car on Craigslist and ended up having transmission issues right off the bat. I brought my car into allstate transmissions and they diagnosed my vehicle for free with no appointment. Turned out it needed a complete transmission rebuild. They completed the repairs a day earlier than expected and they did a great job. Sadly the light came back on the next day but I brought it back in and they corrected the issue immediately. Thank you Mitch Nicole and Jeff for all your help. I will definitely recommend your shop to anyone I know needing transmission work.
positive,"I have taken multiple vehicles here at the recommendation of Curt from Shadow Mountain Automotive.  I was extremely pleased with Bill and State to State.  I've also sent my secretary here as well, and she had the same experience I did.  Bill has never steered me wrong, and he always does right by me.  I am just about to leave to go take another truck to him to get a brand new transmission... It is such a good feeling to know that you have a transmission shop that you can trust, that will be fair with you.  Thanks Bill, for the old school service/business ethics."
positive,"Came here for the second time to get several vaccines for an upcoming international trip. First, the lady on the phone who I talked to when scheduling was very helpful. She explained how the process worked, and was very supportive in squeezing my partner and myself into a single appointment. 

Upon arrival the building is inside of a strip mall. The waiting room is quite large and very clean, with lots of informational brochures and an informational video on vaccines playing on the TV. We were directed to check in on the computers in the lobby (which for me, was a refreshing change compared to filling out five pieces of paper for the registration paperwork). 

We were quickly escorted back to see the nurse practitioner who was also incredibly friendly. She walked us through what our options were, and even was prepared to offer advice on prophylactic steps to avoid food/water and mosquito transmitted illnesses. This is a great resource for the average person, and I am glad it is offered, however, I think it should be an OPTION. I am one month from being a physician, and did my own research on what vaccines I did and did not need, and the transmission of diseases is not anything new...so it would be nice if you could call and get an appointment just for the vaccines you need instead of having to pay for an appt. with a nurse practitioner. Again, it's a great service, do not get me wrong, but it should be optional. 

We were then given our vaccines and prescriptions and sent on our way. Travel vaccines can be VERY VERY VERY expensive (it is not that they are expensive here, they are expensive in general). We easily spent over $1300. So make sure that you have good insurance to reimburse you before you go or be prepared to pay a lot of money out of pocket. They do not bill insurance/take insurance, so you must pay and then be reimbursed. 

Overall, a great experience, and I'd recommend this place to anyone with international travel plans."
positive,"We've had our 2003 Boxster S into Beck's twice for some major work, and I have to say I've never had such a positive experience with a repair shop! Their prices are extremely reasonable, and they do excellent work. 

When we had a problem with 2nd gear on our transmission, the dealership and another shop I called wanted me to replace the whole tranny (about $5-7k!!) but Beck's realized it was a common problem and not a difficult fix for their technicians (the guy who worked on my car had spent 5+ years as a factory tech in Stuttgart!).

Their office staff is friendly, the mechanics will come out and explain what they are doing, and the owner Frank is always good about calling if there are any unforeseen problems. Contrast that with the Porsche Dealer in town, I couldn't get the time of day from their ""service managers"" because I wasn't driving a brand new Porsche.

I've also referred a friend for his BMW M3, he said Beck's charged him much less than the dealership for a major repair, and did a great job. If you own a BMW or Porsche and don't take it to Beck's, you're doing it wrong!"
positive,"I don't have a BMW, neither do I have a ton of money to put into my Nissan Maxima, but I did want to get my check engine light, smog and brake issues resolved before giving up on this car I bought that I thought was a good deal. After having to spend too much money on an ignition cylinder lock at the dealer, and then told to not bother tying to fix the other issues, but buy another car, I had to find another way. Then I found Lee. I didn't think it would be practical to fix everything, but to my surprise, not only did Lee fix more than I asked (everything), he did it for way less than what the Nissan dealer would have charged (if they had the will to do it), and he did it pretty quickly. It's great to have a mechanic who knows what he's doing, and who doesn't lie or cheat, but treats you with honesty, respect and delivers top notch expertise."
positive,"Thanks to Alan and the crew for getting my truck running smooth! They fixed my transmission and drive shaft, you can barely feel the gears shift. Don't hesitate to bring your truck or car here, I was from out of town and went here on a recommendation. My truck now runs better than it ever did!!"
positive,"An update to my previous review-  this time we worked with Andrew in the service department, he took the time to really check out what was wrong and did a transmission program update and flushed the transmission fluid, and tried to really see what he could do to fix the possible problems. The car is running much better, and hopefully these problems will not present themselves again- so thank you Andrew. 
As a customer, this is what I think should happen in the first place instead of having to come back several times for the same problem."
positive,"I had some car issues, thinking it was the transmission, I dropped my car off on Sunday. They called me monday, with an exact diagnosis of what was wrong (throttle position sensor), they charged me nothing and told me how to replace it by myself. Saved me HUNDREDS of dollars. Thank you guys."
positive,"Broken down in Vegas...sounds like a good country-western song until you live it...towed in your RV.  Great staff, extremely competent and reasonably priced repair of a transmission problem in our Rialta that another car repair company had created.  Love the friendly atmosphere, and we'll be coming back for services in the future."
positive,I just purchased a 1970 GMC C1500 and I knew the transmission needed rebuilt. Bill and his crew took care of it at a decent price. Truck is running fantastic. They fixed everything the previous owner destroyed and even through in some extras. Thanks Bill!
positive,"State to State was recommended to me by another mechanic for my transmission needs.  (A trusted mechanic is the best guy to ask for a referral!)  I first took my 2010 Ford F150 to State to State for a leaky transmission.  Bill's guys fixed the issue quickly and affordably.  Next, I took my 1968 Corvette in for a total transmission rebuild and clutch replacement.  Again ...  All fixed quickly, perfectly and affordably.  I give State to State Transmission my highest recommendation for all of your transmission needs!"
positive,A blessing!  My check engine light came on as I was driving into work one morning.  I pulled off 485 and drove to the nearest garage and it was Manchester.  The place is very clean and the guys are super friendly.  The customer service is outstanding.  They even were able to drop me off at work and then picked me up once my car was done!  I really felt they had my best interest at heart.  Highly recommended.
positive,Tom Hal and Glenn these guys are rockstars they worked with me when my transmission went out on my 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe now I'm the proud owner of a 2009 Nissan cube I will definitely do business with them again
positive,On more than one occasion they have been helpful and honest. One time I went in with an airbag sensor issue. They told me they could fix it but that the vehicle had a recall and the dealer would fix it for free. Another time I went in with some transmission issues. I did tell them if it was the transmission I would not repair the car but instead put the money into a new one. They drove my vehicle and determined it was my transmission along with brakes and other problems. They agreed it was a very expensive fix and didn't charge me to look at the vehicle. I will now be purchasing a new vehicle that will have a warranty but as soon as it expires I'm headed back to tuffy for any service it will need.
positive,"Went to these guys because my check engine light was on and my gas gauge wasn't working. They said we needed a new fuel pump. They had my jeep for about 4hrs and called and said they found broken wires near the gas pump, which was causing the light to go off. Basically, our bill went from 600$ to 110$. They could've been greedy and not replaced it and still charged us the 600$. All in all, great customer service. Honest, hard working people."
positive,Was getting the run around from the insurance company I had to deal with to get my car repaired and these guys completely took care of those annoying phone calls and did great repair work on my car. Thanks so much for everything guys! Especially Derrick!
positive,"I had come down here since, my Honda CRV brake pads were spoilt and I had a noisy drive everywhere I went. Though it was a walk-in for the service, somehow I could get the car repaired after 4 hrs of wait. Anyways, appreciate for without an appointment and getting it done so fast on time."
positive,"Bill is honest & very knowledgeable. He helped me retrieve my transmission's error codes. So, I could make a claim to the dealership. Who repeatedly denied an obvious transmission problem. I was then able to receive warranty coverage. Bill saved me thousands of dollars & didn't even charge me for the diagnosis. Bill restored my faith in the auto service industry. His pride in workship should be applauded & an example to all who just want to get paid."
positive,"I had excellent professional work done by Underground Diesel.  They installed a new upgraded transmission cooler, Banks techo intercooler, banks automind tuner and a complete brake upgrade.  They truck runs amazing and the brake upgrade was better than expected. There labor and parts pricing was excellent.  Will be back for more work in the future.  Highly recommend!"
positive,"Whitey's is great. Brought my car in for a transmission repair in the morning and they had it done ahead of schedule that evening. The technician also went as far as to offer removing the transmission oil from the bill as they had forgotten to add it to the original quote. Great, honest company and staff that offers their services at a reasonable price. If your in need of auto repair this is most certainly my first suggestion."
positive,Everyone knows how difficult it is to find a trustworthy mechanic.  I just had my 2010 Camry serviced today at Precision Imports and I will definitely return.  I paid about half of what the dealer quoted and most importantly I trust the honesty and expertise from Precision.  They serviced the transmission and radiator using OEM fluids and did the job right. These guys are true professionals and were very committed to pleasing this customer. Thanks!!
positive,"After my car broke down in the desert and I faced a gazillion dollar tow charge, I had the wonderful fortune of finding Cars Complete Auto Repair online and rated well on Yelp. They deserve their rating. A wonderful group all around. Caesar was my mechanic. He immediately pulled the top off my motor so that I could see my timing chain and more were slack and screwed. The reason, it turned out, that my timing belt was screwed was because my previous mechanic hadn't torqued down a bolt and it had literally fallen off. Caesar not only made all repairs for a good price but saved all the bad parts for me so that I could confront the bad mechanic...then he called the bad mechanic and vouched for the problem. That didn't do any good, but I appreciated his help very much. Lastly, he referred me to Performance Muffler for a great muffler job.  The least I could do was write them a great Yelp review, and I will bring them my future business. Thanks Caesar! And all the other folks who helped out. (No, they are not the cheapest probably, but they are fair and do exactly what they say.)"
positive,"I have been coming here for smogs, oil changes & basic maintenance after my free dealership oil changes for 1st 2yrs expired with my current vehicle. 2013 Honda Civic. 3yr 8mo now. Obviously, the $7.77 smog check is the best deal anywhere in the city.  Marlene at the front runs a smooth operation. The wait area is fairly small. 5 chairs I believe? A coffee machine, restroom & TV.
I have had 5 oil changes done here in 41.5mo. And smog checks required for car registration annual renewals. So 10 visits thus far. My car uses full synthetic which costs more. USA's price is comparable to other places. I have the type of car that tells you when oil needs changing & other basic maintenance. Usually it says to get tire rotation same time as oil change. Which are typically complimentary. Since my car oil changes seem fairly consistent at about every 8mo. I was not sure if the car's just saying it at regular intervals, the wear has just been consistent or the indicator says 0% oil life before it gets really dirty. I decided to ask a mechanic here what the condition of my oil was. He said I probably could have gone a bit longer before a change. So I asked if it was dirty enough to require a change. He said yeah. You can interpret that how you want.
Like many of these auto convenience shops, they do a complimentary inspection of car for preventive maintenance. As you can see on the reviews, there's both good & bad experiences. It should be noted, shops are known to upsell unnecessary services. So one should do their own due diligence. You don't need to be an expert mechanic. But it's good to have at least a basic knowledge of car maintenance or know someone who does. I fall in the former category, emphasis on basic. Check your car manual or it's easy to google anything one does not know. Isn't the internet a great thing?
My experiences here have been mixed. Some services I have been recommended were needed and some were not or not yet. Which is the point of 'preventive' maintenance, with exception of services not needed at all or any time soon. A few like changing engine & cabin air filters are easy to do by one's self.(Filters which I buy at O'Reilly's: see my review for them). Watched YouTube, did it in under 5min. Had transmission fluid changed & fuel injectors/throttle body cleaned 2 visits ago May 2018. To be fair, the mechanic(can't recall name) did say they were not in bad shape but should be done in near future. I did not notice any problems, so it may have been early. But I figured my car was almost 5yrs old 45k mi without having either done ever. And I was offered a deal to get both done so I had them do it.
Last visit Jan 2019 for most recent oil change & tire rotation. I was recommended air & cabin air filter change(was near recommended change time), front brake pads low(started squeaking a few weeks ago), fuel injector cleaning(odd since they did that 8mo 7k mi ago, with no noticeable fuel economy change before & after the service. And I only use Top Tier fuel to boot). So they should be fairly clean. Side note: Top Tier gas at Arco & Costco happen to also be some of the cheapest places to fill up, at least in the SW. I said I could change air filters myself. Asked how much left on brake pads. They said don't need to be done right now, but soon for sure. So I replaced air filters myself later on. Will get the front brake pads replaced soon. Doubtful fuel injectors need cleaning any time in the near future.
Overall I would recommend USA. Especially for the smog check. Just double check on recommended services, as one should with any place you take your car to be serviced."
positive,"Took my wife's 2008 550i in today for intermittent check engine light and what I thought was suspension issue. I wasn't very thorough in explaining symptoms as I'm not a mechanic but Nathan was patience with me.  Kameron called me and explained the issue with check engine and provided recommendations for other items they found but did not push repairs on me.  I like the fact that part numbers and labor hours are clearly listed on invoice and estimate.  I only have budgeted for certain repair costs so I didn't do all the recommended items.  I was very surprised that they wash my car and cleaned the interior.  I will return to complete other recommended items.  First class service at reasonable prices.  Thanks Kameron and Nathan, you've gained another customer."
positive,"Synopsis :  Professional and affordable service. The people there are friendly and honest and will take the step further to make everything exceptional. 

I bought a 1998 Honda Accord from craigslist. My check engine light turned on about two weeks after buying the car. (Obviously I'm no car genius) Took it into auto zone to check the light and the guy there mentioned Mak Automotive Service. Didn't think much of it. Talked to an acquaintance that comes to my work and he too mentioned to take it here. Too much of a coincidence in my opinion to have two people the same day tell me where to go. So I did. 

Walk in and I'm greeted by a smile. Very professional yet still with a personality. (I say this because sometimes when I talk to people in a business type scenario it's like talking to a cardboard cutout.) Something that I noticed is that everything was clean and organized. Even the bathroom was clean. 
Left the car there to get checked over. Calls me back saying that it has a factory defect and that Honda won't cover it because it's over the warranty. Gives me a price quote. I lie and tell him to give me a few minutes see if I can come up with the money. So I check the internet, turns out he was right about it and my Honda did have a factory defect. Call in a few other top rated yelp places and Honda and get quoted at least 70 dollars more. I get the job done and my Honda purrs like a cat. 

He even changed out a light bulb that was out on my lights for free! I know a bulb isn't a huge deal but it means a lot when they took the time to fix it and even better he didn't even charge me for it. Actions like these are what make excellent service into exceptional service. 

Since then I've gotten brake pads done here; I got a free oil change out of it. Valve adjusted. Always been quoted less than other places and I know I can trust them."
positive,"This is the 2nd time I came here for my oil change and it's only $12.95 so with tax it comes out to $17.00 which isn't bad compared to other places where they charge $29.99.  They also did my transmission flush for only $69 the first time I came here which is also a good deal.

Service is quick, too.  They're conveniently located on Rainbow between Sahara and Oakey and not hard to find at all."
positive,"I would recommend this company to anyone!  I don't live in Arizona, but I was driving through and my check engine light came on.  Being a woman by myself in an unknown area, I was a little nervous- but they were so great and looked everything over.  It ended up being a simple $20 fix and 30 minutes later I was back on my way home without any other problems.  They really could have told me anything and I would have believed them and paid whatever it took to get back on the road, but they were honest and empathetic to my situation.  Thank you so much, I wish there was one closer that I could use more often :)"
positive,"This is a very true story of how Christian Brothers Automotive works.  They have done a front end alignment,  some rack and pinion work, a full brake job, and some misc other work on my Toyota.   After a long road trip, I noticed the brakes were causing a big shimmy on the front end, so also knowing I needed some tires, I had some 70K Bridgestones put on and had a brake job done.  I went to rotate my tires at 9k and the fronts were gone, with extreme wear to the inside of the fronts.

I went back to CBA and showed them my tires and they were aghast at the wear.  Put my car up on the rack and found my tolerances way out.  I had new tires put back on the fronts and had them realign the car again.  My check engine light had also come on and I was in need of an engine sensor.

After I had to buy $425 worth of front tires again, they took responsibility for aligning my car and replacing the sensor for me at no charge.  While many shops would have found an excuse to place the tire wear on me, they did the right thing and really worked with me to ensure I was taken care of.  They ate about $375 worth of work that they didn't have to.

Each time I go in to their shop, I am treated respectfully, am communicated with on estimate and finish time, but most importantly, they want to make you feel like a valued customer and want your return business. 

Thank you Christian Brother Automotive for taking some responsibility in my cars problem and making me a happy, returning, customer."
positive,"I recently traveled to Henderson from Los Angeles for a business trip. Upon my arrival my check engine light came on... so I knew I was in for a long few days. The following day after doing some research and reading some reviews on yelp I came across Valley Automotive. Before making my way to my clients home, my team and I picked up a Uhaul (which we needed for my client anyways) and dropped off my car. it was instantly in great hands with Casey and his team. After checking out my car Casey informed me that it was a good ole transmission problem. He communicated with me throughout the process and was VERY understanding and sincere about my situation. Since my car was still under warranty he contacted the Dodge dealerships to try and make arrangements for me to get it repaired prior to my return back to Los Angeles. He took care of everything. :) AMAZING. Once we realized that it was best to just tow my car back to Los Angeles, he let me store it at his repair shop until I was able to pick it up and haul it back on an auto transport with the uhaul. And if that wasn't enough when I arrived to pick it up his team helped me load it on the auto transport! 

I have never BEEN MORE GRATEFUL for the kindness, flexibility and amazing communication of Casey and his team. Everyone is always looking for an honest mechanic. A place that you can take your car and trust that you aren't getting ripped off... just b/c you are girl or might not know everything about cars. I found this mechanic in Casey and his team. I wish I lived in Henderson b/c he would have my  business for life. Amazing job! Thank you thank you thank you! When I got back to LA and had to deal with my dealership here... I felt prepared. 

You have my referral for life!"
positive,"Service department is great! My family and I just moved to this area and have already gone to the dealership for a routine oil change the in the quick lane and transmission service on our Ford edge. Hands down the best experience I've ever dealt with from a service department in the valley. Blows Berge Ford out of the water and makes me as comfortable and supported as my great experiences with Jim Click Ford down in Tucson. Quick Lane service is amazing and the whole staff is extremely knowledgable and hospitable even when I am not operating 100% before my coffee kicks in (which you can get right there at the little cafe while you wait). No hassle on pricing. Last visit was at no charge even though I had a handful of minor concerns to address. Had a rental car provided to my wife at 15$ a day for 3 days while they closely tried to diagnose the issues based on my descriptive sounds and suggestions . In that time they reprogrammed the transmission controls and added a quart to my transmission fluid (not sure why it was low, no leak) and back in a week for full transmission service. Also fixed blower/ vacuum leak in my brake system. Keeping my family safe on the road. I rarely buy from a dealership and I don't know how the sales side is yet at San Tan Ford so this review is purely regarding parts and service department. I'm very appreciative of the team there. So far I think everyone's name is Eric. I've dealt with two Erics and they were both excellent. Look forward to taking my vehicle back again and may even look for my Ford diesel there rather than private party or small dealership."
positive,"Above and BEYOND customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was referred to Allstate by Tucker Tire (another excellent automotive repair place!) for transmission issues.  I had just purchased a used 2002 Dodge 15 passenger van and had it die on me the weekend before heading up the I-17 in Cordes Junction.  Turns out that it needed a transmission cooler installed.  I took it to Allstate the next day and they were happy to give me a ride home (approximately 8 miles) while they worked on my van.  I was desperate to get the repairs done quickly and correctly -- as I was headed to Colorado the next day.  I'm a professional dog handler and was heading to a dog show with 2 other people and 5 dogs!!  I was nervous when I picked up the van...as I had just recently purchased from a private party that did not keep good records on the repairs she had done -- but I was assured by the guys there that it was a good van and could easily make it to Colorado now that it had a new transmission cooler.

Well, we got an early start on our trip the next morning and left Phoenix about 5:00 a.m. --- made a pit stop at Cordes Junction to get gas and snacks...and as I returned to the van from the store, I was TERRIFIED to see red liquid dripping out all over from the front of the van!!!  In a panic, I called the number on the business card from Allstate --- and I was shocked (but in a GOOD way) that Jeff Wilson (the general manager) answered the phone!!!  It was only 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning!!!  I explained the problem to Jeff as well as the fact that we were already an hour outside of Phoenix and with 5 dogs in the van -- it was getting hot and I HAD to get on the road.  Jeff was understanding and advised me to add some transmission fluid to get me up the road a bit to the home of the gal that we were picking up.  I had to hang out there for a few hours....but Allstate SENT A TECHNICIAN ALL THE WAY TO MAYER, AZ TO FIX THE PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have never heard of customer service like this!!!!  I feel terrible that I have forgotten the gentleman's name that came to help -- but he arrived on his motorcycle with every part they could possibly need to fix the van -- turns out it was a faulty cooler and he had to replace that -- which he did at no charge.  Although we got an extremely late start on our trip -- I can't say enough about how pleased I was at the way Allstate handled this problem.  I plan on using them for all future repairs on this vehicle!!!!"
positive,"I'm so glad I was recommended by friends to this place. This was my first time, and I'll be back! I asked in a VW group I'm in and several people said go here, so I tried it and I'll be back. 

I had an issue with my check engine light that another performance place couldn't figure out but London figured it out quickly and fixed it.  They even took my car next door to get the emissions test. They went above and beyond and for that I'll be back. I'm so glad I found an awesome trustworthy European car mechanic. 

Customer service was great. Prices are great for the level of service. They even have a waiting room with premium channels to help ya be comfy while ya wait. Thanks guys! I'll be back around soon!"
positive,"The best , most honest mechanic I've ever met . Hard working professional . Refer as many people to Narcisso as possible . I no longer dread having my car repaired ."
positive,Highly recommend this shop for muffler and exhaust work. I made an appointment and was in and out in only 15 minutes. Minor repair for a rubber exhaust hanger was treated with the same service as if I was getting a full system. Excellent service!
positive,"Imagine, driving down 15 south and see the Vegas lights and looked down to see a check engine light turn on! Bitter sweet entrance to Vegas... There was no change in drive quality but to make sure I researched several places around the strip. I decided to go to Liberty Tech and Tire, where I found very professional, trustworthy, and timely car repair. I found that the check light code was for a faulty catalytic converter. Rashid gave a very honest solution, where the parts would take 1-2 business days to arrive to Vegas because its usually not stocked and informed me that the best option was to carry on and drive my Subaru as is.  It turns out that some Subaru's activate check lights because of certain atmosphere conditions that Vegas have. I took his word and the next day drove back to the bay area and on the way back along interstate 5 the check light went away. Till this day, it has not came back. If you are looking for a down to earth mechanic that will give you your best option, this is the place to go to!. Rashid's advice save me from getting a costly, unnecessary repair done."
positive,"The check engine light came on of the BFs car so we came in for them to read the code. It's fairly simple, quick and free to do at Autozone. 

They read the code and then printed us out papers of what it means and items we might need and parts that they  have/ can order and those that they cannot. 

This was way more painfree than asking your stealership to read your car and get hustled for a handful of things that they tell you the car needs."
positive,"Good service, reasonable, and no hanky-panky on the deal.

I had the brakes, spark plugs, oil changed, and fluids flushed. Price was reasonable and Anthony even downgraded the cost when the transmission fluid didn't need to be changed.

Impressed."
positive,Great place when my Corolla had a problem in the muffler. Tony and Basil were great in helping me all throughout the repair by finding the cheapest solution and going the extra mile to make sure I left their shop happy! I will definitely return for other repairs as they are both certified by Toyota.
positive,CUT OFF
positive,"I am usually anti-dealership because I have always perceived taking my car to a dealership to be much more expensive than taking it to a random shop to be fixed.  I have a 2001 New Beetle, and my first experience with Camelback VW was a couple years ago, when I went in to get the car's window fixed.  All went well.  Looking to save cash though, I went to a different local shop when it was time to get my car repaired so it could pass emissions.  That place got me to pass emissions for around $350 by replacing the O2 censor on my thingy-ma-bob.  (Hey, I'm a girl, sorry).  It was certainly better than replacing the entire catalytic converter for around $900.  

This year, I've been investing in getting some work done on the car.  I went in for a wheel balance and oil change a couple weeks ago.  The service guy, Frank, found a bunch of stuff wrong with the car's suspension.  The dreaded catalytic converter replacement still needs to happen, too.  I decided to start fixing the suspension one bit at a time since a lot needs to be done.  Frank quoted me for around $550 for that day's work and sent me home with a nice, clean Subaru loaner car for the night.  

I came back the next day to a car that had new arm bushings (hope that's what those thingies are called) in addition to my originally-planned oil change and wheel balance.  They took a bit too long to get the car finished and returned to me.  Frank felt bad for making me wait and knocked some extra cash off the bill and didn't charge me for some of the work that was done.  So I saved around $200 on the overall bill.  

I plan to go back to have more work done on the car soon.  I prefer Camelback VW for oil changes because the quickie-lube places just don't have a knack for doing things right...but that's another review for another time!"
positive,"I needed to get my oil changed and I waited a couple days and did not have time to go to the dealership so I stopped in - plus it's only a couple minutes from my house! There were already two cars getting an oil change, but it was only a couple minutes. They offered me a beverage (actually a couple times, which was nice) and they pulled up my car. They told me my car is usually synthetic oil and asked if I wanted that one, I told them yes. After a couple minutes the young gentleman asked me if I ever had a transmission flush (or something like that). He explained it - even if I did not understand some of it, haha - and told me he can do a discount for it. I told him to go ahead with it. The whole process took less than waiting at the dealership, and I do not have to leave my car! 
Everyone that I encountered (about 4 employees) was professional and welcoming. I will definitely be back when my oil needs to be changed again!"
positive,"Sang took care of me today, changed oil, transmission fluid & tire rotation. Reasonable prices! Son & dad owned business, honest people. Had good conversation in the shop while car was being worked on, would recommend."
positive,"I was helped by Matthew K. I asked to get my check engine light checked out. He went above and beyond by giving me a print out of the diagnosis but not only that, he broke it down to me and explained what it all meant. He also gave me a print out of prices for each items to give me an estimate of how much it would be to fix them. He is awesome!! Thank you Matthew!!"
positive,I just took my truck to these guys cause my check engine light was on and I couldn't pass a smog check without it.when I first got inside I was recently greeted by the owner of the shop with great hospitality felt he was a really cool guy they look at my truck and found that the fuel pump wasn't put on properly from the other place I took my truck to for a new fuel pump well they fixed that and did a diagnostic check on the truck to make sure nothing else was wrong for free I tried to pay for the diagnostic but they said no charge I will be returns to these guys for any of my car repairs I recommend these guys for any of our car care needs oh May I add they have Netflix in the waiting room normally mechanic shops have dr.phil or some crap talk show on but these guys got a 5 star waiting room
positive,"I wish I could remember the name of the gentleman who serviced me during my visit, but really, every man I spoke to was kind and helpful. It was affordable and manageable, especially with their discounts! I was able to have my brake pads replaced; as well as transmission, brake and synthetic oil flushes. Granted that much work is going to be costly, I saved at least $250 by going to Brakes Plus instead of my Honda dealership! I checked! Even when it was difficult on them to pick me back up from work at the end of the day, they figured it out and I appreciated it very much. Those guys work hard! Well worth the time and money!"
positive,I will start by telling you don't go anywhere else for transmission repairs. I went to AAMCO first and they quoted me $2500 to REBUILD my transmission and Jim quoted me $1500 to FIX it. He explained everything to me very clearly. Indian land transmission never even called me back. Don't waste your time and go straight to Jim
positive,"These guys rebuilt the A4LD on my '93 Ranger six months ago, coming highly recommended by a general mechanic buddy.  Except for two minor issues, I'd give them 5 stars - the work was completed promptly and professionally, and they gave me a fair price.  The two minor issues:  1.) While the rebuild (bench work) was perfect and the transmission looks and functions as good as new, the install was sloppy:  the ground wire to my starter was stretched / left loose when it was reinstalled.  The connector burned / broke off two days later, leaving me stranded.  Happily, this happened at home, and I was able to identify the problem pretty quickly and repair it myself (crimped on a new connector and reattached the wire);  2.) This place is busy, and they have grown the business considerably in the past couple of years.  This showed in the communication mix-up between Clyde and Erika that delayed them starting work on my transmission for three days; when I called in to get a status, I learned Erika had been out sick and hadn't relayed my OK to proceed - so a two-day job took five.  Again, no major issue, but it would have been a different story had this been my work vehicle.  That said, I am still a satisfied customer and will return to Pete's when I need transmission work."
positive,"Had a leaking transmission line and they fixed it within a day, ready-to-go. They also do tune-ups, fluid flushes, brakes, regular maintenance, etc. so I know where to go whenever I need something done on my jeep that I can't do. Very friendly staff and Larry in the office is a great conversationalist while you're waiting! These guys know what they're doing and they do it well."
positive,It is never fun to have to take your car in for service when it is broken. My son and I had to our car in for AC repair and needed it done on a Saturday rather than on a weekday.  Gabriel was able to fit us in quickly on a Saturday morning even without an appointment and had the car repaired within a few hours as previously agreed in our estimate.  They even agreed to give us a very nice discount on the repair when we asked.  Thank you Gabriel for your customer service.
positive,"Jack and his team have worked on a few different vehicles I've brought in over the years and here's why I keep coming back. 

Jack tells you what you need and what you can do without. He is upfront about cost and time involved in doing a repair. 

I always take my vehicle here for an inexpensive quick oil change, but if you can't wait while your vehicle is being serviced Justine or someone else will give you a ride wherever and call you when it's ready to be picked up. They will come back and pick you up so no need to figure out how your going to get back to your vehicle. 

My boyfriend also brings his truck in for regular maintenance. Just recently he had some transmission issues and Jack was able to find the issue immediately and get parts ordered right away. The work this shop does is always in a timely manner even if it's a big job to be done. 

I support local businesses and that is just another reason why I keep coming back to this Napa. The staff is also very friendly.

Thanks Jack and everyone at Napa!"
positive,"This review is primarily for the service department, since I'm fortunate enough to work for an employer that furnishes a vehicle for me. Although if I were to consider a purchase in the future, I'd be more than comfortable here.

A trip to a service center is typically anything but simple for me. Part of my job involves managing a fleet of about 18 vehicles. While we use an on-site mechanic for most of our routine work, all of the warranty and heavy duty jobs go here.

For about a year now, I've been coming here with vehicles having a wide variety of issues. From a complete transmission replacement to a thermostat replacement, I can normally get things done here in a reasonable time. We've had things take longer than I feel they should take here and there, but overall the service department does their best for us.

Given the above, I'm well aware that my experience here might be different than most people. My best advice to anyone wanting the best dealership service experience would be to get to know one Service Advisor very well! Schedule regular maintenance through him/her every time, develop a good working relationship with them. I've found that talking to 'whoever' over the phone (at any dealership) will lead to miscommunication and ultimately cause headaches.

One note about the waiting room: They have a Starbucks coffee machine that grinds whole beans fresh for each and every cup, and brews it right there for you. The waiting game is so much more bearable here for that reason alone!

No service department is perfect, but these guys do a good job here."
positive,"I have never seen a dealership's service department close at 8:00 PM.  I can't believe these guys understand that the majority of the population has jobs that are 8-5.  They are AWARE of that fact.  Not to mention they serviced my Ford Fiesta & when I needed a rental they even called me to let me know when one was available.  Then when my car was ready & fixed, I was able to drop off the rental even though they rental guys were gone for the day.  And when I forgot to fill up the tank in the rental they even let me go to a fuel station nearby to fill er up so I wouldn't get charged jet fuel prices for them filling it themselves.  Wow.  Let me also mention that when I looked like I was waiting around for someone, whether it was the rental guy or the service advisor or even the cashier chick, there was always someone who cared enough to ask me if I was okay & if i was waiting on someone & when I told them I was & whom, they said the person would be with me as soon as possible.  Wow again.  No other Service Department at a Ford dealership (OR ANY dealership), whether it be in my hometown of San Antonio, TX, or elsewhere in Arizona, has been so courteous.  None other has left so much of an impression as San Tan Ford Service Dept.  Thank you guys.  

I haven't even touched the subject of how they repaired issues that were otherwise passed off as ""Normal"" with Earnhardt Ford.  I'm not trying to slam Earnhardt, but the very last time I went there twice in a row they said that transmission shuddering & hesitation are normal per Ford.  Now I can't verify that Ford Motor Company was the one telling them it's normal, but I do know that San Tan fixed the issue months after I had to endure a rattly transmission & they fixed it right the first time I told them about it.  Maybe Ford told dealerships to say those things to customers.  I don't know.  One thing's for sure.  No more rattles, no more shudders, no more hesitation from first to second gear.  Sweeeeeet.  The TCM was replaced.  Something I knew about from reading Ford Forums.  They identified the issue & now I am on the road with my own car again with zero issues with the trans.  Am I angry at Earnhardt?  No.  Do I live near San Tan now & want to go to a dealership closer to home for service?  Yup."
positive,"Again 2 Wrenches has been reliable, honest and incredibly helpful in evaluating my car and ensuring it is safe for a move up to the PNW. Will miss these mechanics as it is hard to come by ones that you truly trust. Always reasonable prices and dedicated work. In February 2017 I was told by another mechanic that I would need an entirely new transmission after failing an emissions test. I brought my car to 2 wrenches and they discovered it was just filthy transmission fluid (neglected by other previous mechanic) and cleaned it out and passed my emissions for me, saved me from getting duped into buying a new transmission or a new car. Have recommended to all friends and family. Would give 10 stars if I could."
positive,For some people going to get your car repaired is like going to the dentist. I travel to Montreal frequently. A relative suggested that I go to Canbec for maintenance and repairs on my BMW X5. Manon Pelletier was my service adviser. I needed to have some extensive work done on the car and Manon informed me that parts would have to be ordered from Toronto. Since I only had 2 days to have the work performed they had the parts fedexed and the car was ready ahead of time. Manon was true to her word. Great service professionally done. Best of all the car is riding better than ever. Merci Manon!
positive,"Let me start by saying that I am not a car expert in anyway and therefore cannot speak from a technical perspective about the quality of service they performed.  I can say though when I left, my car did not leak oil and that from a customer service perspective they got it right.  The mechanic was friendly and courteous.  He did recommend that I get my transmission fluid changed and suggested a couple options and the cost but no pressure at all.  I will definitely use them in the future for non-warranty work."
positive,"Recently I had the pleasure of working with, quite simply, the nicest, most professional used car salewoman, ever. 

Wait a moment.  Let's take a second to examine the outrageousness of the single sentence.  When has that last happened?  Never?  But wait...

We all know how painful the car-buying experience can be.  Gosh, that just wasn't the case here.  Susan Lupton, Sales Professional at Acura North Scottsdale, made the experience painless.  Lots of coffee, some pleasant conversation while the suits shuffled paper, and a reasonable deal for the nicest 2012 VW Beetle in town.

Susan was thoroughly professional and made me feel like my time was as important and valuable as hers.  The whole sales process took about 3  1/2 hours, and considering a trade was involved, too, not unnecessarily long.

This is my third Beetle, 6 model years newer than the last.  What great improvements to the car!

On last thing: Susan is responsible for selling me the first car I've ever owned that wasn't a standard shift.  My new car is an automatic.  I just figured, ""...it'll be ok"".  She told me I'd love it!  

The funny thing is, change does happen: the car has it's own version of a ""Tiptronic"" transmission, meaning, when you slide the stick over to the right, you can shift to any gear, 1-6.   This is not a compromise.  This is unbelievably fast and efficient!  I can take a curve, say entering one of the freeways, downshift to 3rd or even 2nd, hit that baby at 45 or 50, instead of 35 or 40...fantastic control!  I have MORE -more!- control / options / torque than on any manual I've ever driven!  
And now I take back every bad thing I've ever said about ""automatic transmissions"" and their drivers.  

I never thought I would be gladly writing a 5 star Yelp review for a car-buying experience, (see my previous post about Scottsdale North VW...) but Susan Lupton at Acura North Scottsdale changed my mind.  She is a no-nonsense professional who will not waste your time.  Highly recommended."
positive,"Ultra Collision far exceeded my expectations! I was not familiar with the step by step procedure of getting my car repaired after a driver ran a red light and smashed the side and back of my car. Steve (owner) navigated the insurance situation and the rental car for me. The workmanship was superior, the job was completed right on time, and my car was detailed in the process. You can trust Ultra Collision! I would use them again in a heartbeat and I will be recommending them to family and friends."
positive,"My overall honest review

So this is my second time buying a car off the lot, and I'm more happy with this decision than I was about the first time. 

I came in on a busy evening and was first helped by Chris
He helped every way possible. Even to renegotiate the payments as best as possible. The very first car I saw was the car I am now driving so I got exactly what I wanted with really bad credit. My down payment was beyond reasonable. The car is beautiful. It does have very high mileage but I love my car!! & I'll take what I can get due to credit and not having more of a down payment, they worked with me.

The process was very quick and easy even with it being busy. He made it a point to offer to fill it up as well ( he forgot so, I had to come back, but he still did it). He really helped me. 

Signing the papers with Luis was good as well. He explained everything to me and made sure I understood what I was signing before we moved on asking questions like "" does that make sense "" it made me feel really good & taken care of.

I was so scared and skeptical about this place because of the reviews. I was so scared of getting stuck with a lemon ( let me not speak too soon )
The only negative thing I have to say about this is
1) they do not respond when it comes to email. Not even to call back and confirm that it was read or even being worked on. So that kind of upsets me because I want to feel confident and I need to be reassured 
2) my USB in the car does not work like the fuse is dead and I feel like they should fix it. 
( i wrote this about a month ago so I'm going to update since having the car for about 2 1/2 3 months.

I still love my car and there are no problems. A check engine light came on and it went away. I have had some problems with my door and door handle in the back of the car, after coming up there three different times for this it was finally taken care of.

I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUTOUT TO LAMAR!!!! 
I PROMISE SINCE HE HAS HELPED ME WITH QUESTIONS AND MAKING SURE WHAT I REQUESTED IS DONE AND I AM SATISFIED, HE HAS CHANGED AN ALMOST 3 STAR TO AN ALMOST 5 STAR JUST WITH HIS CUSTOMER SERVICE.
I have been hung up on by so many different people here, Whoever the lady is that answered the phone was not very nice and all they like to do is transfer and hang up or have you on hold so long you just rather drive up there. Not everyone has the luxury to keep driving places. I work very hard and do overtime all the time and I would appreciate if OpenLot took this into consideration.

I know my review is super long & I WILL update this later and tweak and add a few things I know I am forgetting. Overall, my experience with BUYING the car was good after I had the car and minor things I needed just seemed a little annoying having to deal with certain people and not always being acknowledged when I walked in. 

If you are in the position I was in with not a lot of money and not having best of credit, I sure would recommend this place. I was so scared, but I am here to tell you I think this is a good choice overall with the fixed APR and low terms I was given. I went to a different dealership my family is familiar with and their exact words were "" We can't beat this deal. """
positive,"Absolutely the fastest easiest nicest tow ive ever had 
Took exceptional car of my 68 camaro getting it to the transmission shop. Great rate
Used him a few weeks ago to get my rzr back from the repair shop because i was short on time. 
Shane is the man!"
positive,"We had mostly a great experience purchasing a used car.
Gregg G 5stars...professional, personable, listened to what we needed.  Highly recommend Gregg...he also took care of a light that came on the next day...which leads to 
Service Dept 5stars....promptly took care of the check engine light issue (replaced all spark plugs) and also reprogrammed and set up another key without our mentioning it was part of the sale.
Financing Dept...0 stars....they were pushy on trying to sell the extended warranty, took forever to do paperwork, and were not professional.

I would buy a car from Honda Auto Nation again, but not work with their financing dept."
positive,"The counter, shuttle and return service were great. My only complaint is that I have requested a Kia Rio twice and both times ended up with a Ford Fusion (these have a very rough and jerky transmission) We did get pretty good gas mileage though."
positive,My truck transmission took a crap and AAA sent me Stans Towing. Not only did they get there faster than quoted they were professional and very helpful. Being disabled and stuck on the road is never a good combo but if you are in need dont hesitate to call these guys.
positive,"Easy to get to, easy to deal with. I only come here for my car repairs as I've never felt cheated on the cost or quality of repair. They provide all car repair; foreign and domestic, from air conditioning to transmission work. Only downside is there isn't a rental car place next door. There's several with in a few mile range and of course some will pick up you up at the shop. The staff are easy to deal with, customer service is definitely a priority, and I've always felt that they take ownership of my car problem. On average it takes about three days for major repairs and about a day for basic stuff. I wish they were open on the weekends, but they have a lock box for key drop at night and on the weekends I'll keep coming here and strongly recommend you try this shop."
positive,"Saturday morning, only a few service people at the counter and Ricky Paruch looks up and smiles as if he was waiting for me to walk in. He's not my usual go-to but the check engine light came on so I drove over there without an appointment, He was courteous and professional and had my car in and out quickly. 
While I was there waiting for my car, I decided to go talk to a salesperson about my lease options as my lease was coming to an end later this year. I was introduced to Lisa Chabrier, sat down at her desk and was immediately at home with her. I told her what I liked and disliked about my Beetle and she knew exactly what I needed. I know that car buying can be a long, tedious, exhausting experience. I was with Lisa for 4 hours and I had no idea. Being with her was fun and easy and I have everything I was asking for in a car!
Thanks Ricky and Lisa for a fun Saturday at Camelback VW!"
positive,"Service Department: I have a 2010 Lincoln Navigator that needed an oil change. I took it in to San Tan Ford for the first time to get it serviced. (as Robert Horne Ford in Apache Junction lost my business months before) Staff was very friendly, service was prompt. Then a month later, I notice my vehicle had a puddle of oil underneath right away I contact San Tan Ford about it and the first thing they say, do you want us to send a tow truck for your vehicle or do you feel comfortable bringing it in? I had hubby bring it instead. As he got there they were already waiting for him at the dock. Right away they inspected the vehicle and realized that it was not the engine oil, It was the transmission oil. The hubby got a rental car right away and they kept me in the loop of things as they worked on my vehicle to make sure everything was right. This by far this has been the best experience I have felt in a dealership on how customer service was handled- they could have blown me off like nothing saying that my oil change was done over a month ago. But they took care of my vehicle and clearly explained everything.... Thank you Mr. McKenzie in Service Department! You will be seeing us again, as San Tan Ford has gained my business with your excellent customer service & great communication!!!"
positive,"So about six month ago I got an oil change at a jiffy lube, they told me my rear main was leaking! and I knew I had a transmission leak. So I to my truck to a ""reputable"" transmission shop they had a five star rating and yes they where really nice and had wonderful customer service as they told me the rear main would be a thousand to repair and i need to rebuild my transmission for twenty five hundred dollars or something.
So I went to Midas aka Tony for a second opinion he walks me to my car shows me that the rear main is completely dry shows me the problem with my transmission and repairs it for about a hundred bucks.
Recently needed to pass emissions same story I moved so I'm a good forty five minutes from Tony so I went around the corner they quoted me three fifty to fix it so I dropped my car off at Midas last night left message that my check engine light is on I picked it today total bill 125. 
The staff is real nice genuine and HONEST!"
positive,"I had to choose from a list of insurance-approved body shops to get my car repaired after an accident. Mike's Auto Body was nearby and more highly rated than other convenient options. 
They did not disappoint. The turnaround time was quick (less than 3 days) and they did a great job! My car looks as though the accident never happened and I am quite pleased with the work. They had to fix a large dent and some scraped paint.
The neighborhood the shop is located in is not great (some interesting ""characters"" soliciting in the intersection nearby), but the shop itself is clean and comfortable. I did not feel unsafe going to and from the shop in daylight.
The customer service was excellent, as well. Everyone I interacted with was professional and courteous. I was continually updated with progress on my repairs and they were actually finished a day earlier than expected. I hope I don't need to go back to Mike's for repairs, but I would definitely choose them again in the event of an accident!"
positive,"This is going to be a bit of a bizarre review, since we didn't actually have any repairs done to our car, but we experienced some of the best, most loving customer service from the folks at S&S today. 

We were just driving back into the valley from California when suddenly our transmission was having major issues. Exhausted and flustered, we found ourselves at the nearest auto repair spot, which thankfully turned out to be S&S. Jeff took care of us, and graciously took the time to run tests on our car and even give us cold water bottles. Meanwhile, our crazy two year old was running all over their lobby, destroying displays and generally introducing a lot of noise, but everyone was so kind to him, and one nice man even gave him a hot wheels car. It turned out that the problems with our car were too major and specifically transmission-related for this particular shop, but they referred us to another shop and are even letting us keep are car there for the rest of the weekend before we get it towed to the new place. 

That's all very long winded to say, this place is family owned and operated, and you absolutely feel that from the kind people who work there."
positive,"I have taken my car to Purrfect Auto on two occasions. The first time was to fix the undercarriage of my car that had been dragging on the road and making a rather unpleasant noise. I took my car in to Mike and he got it fixed quickly at a low price.

A couple of months later, in a completely unrelated incident, my transmission became extremely infirm, bordering on death. This was something that I had been anticipating for several years, as I had felt it slipping, and so had many auto mechanics. 

Mike found me a used transmission and had his mechanics install it for me. The job took several days (this is standard for such an intense job), but it was completed ahead of schedule. The cost was not cheap, but it was about as low as you could hope to have a reputable shop perform such extensive work. And getting my car properly fixed saved me from having to buy a new car. Most importantly, my transmission is running great now.

Mike and Zade from Purrfect Auto are smart guys and excellent communicators. I plan to continue taking my car to Purrfect Auto."
positive,"Great service for our Spartan chassis in our Entegra motor home.

Josh was great to work with. Replaced a defective fuel sending unit. Changed oil in generator, Cummins 450 engine and the Allison transmission. 

Charles was our tech. A real pro. We stayed in our coach while they did the work. 

They are on a vey quiet cul de sac in Henderson just outside of Las Vegas. 

This is the place to go for Spartan service."
positive,"The place may not look like much, but Rob is a pro. 

My passenger-side exhaust pipe had rusted clean through and the muffler was hanging on by a thread. The pipe had broken in such a way that hot exhaust was pointed directly at a rubber fuel hose. In short, my car was nearly un-driveable. 

In one day, and with no notice, Rob was able to bend two new stainless steel pipes and fit them to my 2005 Mustang (the dual-exhaust was after-market, and about 8 years old), and he put two new mufflers on, too.

The place is right next to a bus stop, too, which made getting back home and there the next day a breeze. 

Highly recommended. 

One note for people who live in Pittsburgh proper; the bus driver expects you to stand up when you're approaching your stop, even if you've pulled the Stop Request cord. I had to walk a mile because I expected him to stop, you know, at the stop I requested."
positive,"-No Stress, No Haggle-

I've had the pleasure of purchasing my Hyundai Accent from here in the past, and it was a delightful experience.

Ron Marhofer does not pay their sales employees by commission, so you won't be haggling for price. They won't try and play games with you. The price on the car is what you'll pay. There aren't mind games being played here, and they won't waste your time. I enjoy this ideology, they won't keep you there for hours to talk to their boss to get the price knocked down and will even show you the Kelly Blue Book rating to ensure that you'll be paying the lowest price possible. I spent hours looking for a car and they were able to get me a great vehicle at a normal cost, alongside offering me a fair price for my old Honda Civic.

Recently, I needed to take my car in for service. My check engine light was on (I've had my car for a few years now) and I needed an alignment (I hit a pothole this year and it messed with my tire at high speed). I was able to place an appointment online and was able to get my car looked at and fixed in just a few short hours. I also noticed that the service staff follows the same principles as the sales staff, they won't gouge you on price, and  they won't make you pay for anything you don't need.

I will certainly be going back here when I go to look for a new car. It's a satisfying buying experience, unlike other dealerships that leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. I highly recommend this dealership over places that pay their sales employees on commission."
positive,"This is the best place to have your car repaired and or just regular maintenance.   Sean who usually answers the phone to set up appointments...is very knowledgeable and helpful to answer questions and give advice on what's going on with your car.  JP is my mechanic and he is fabulous!!!  I trust him with anything that's going on with my car.  I started seeing JP with my 2003 Volkswagen Beetle and now I have a 2015 Fiat 500 as well as a 2005 Honda Accord.  I try to bring them Key Lime Pie, as an extra thank you...I'm probably due to bring them one!!  I recommend JP and Whitey's to ALL my friends!!"
positive,"After being quoted upwards of $700 to replace a catalytic converter, I was referred to Royal Radiator after getting a second opinion from an independent mechanic. Not only did Royal replace my converter, but they also fixed my annoying, rattling muffler for a grand total of $360! I received two repairs for half the cost. They also had my car ready to go within two hours of delivering the quote. They have just gained another customer, and I am so thankful for mechanics like Ramon and his crew."
positive,"The place to go for exhaust work! Needed muffler replacement was under $100 was quoted over $300 at two other shops
Was quick inexpensive and was extremely satisfied highly recommended"
positive,"I first discovered these grease monkeys on Car Talk's website when I wanted to take my Toyota Highlander in for service at a place other than the Toyota dealership. Precision Imports had rave reviews on both Yelp and Car Talk's websites, so I figured I could trust them.  I have gone in twice and both times they were extremely professional, polite and have fixed my car issues quickly at a reasonable price. They are a little out of my way, but I'll happily drive the extra miles since I fully trust them to give my car the best care.

Here's one example from over a year ago. I took my car into a Toyota dealership for a 30,000 mile check up and they came back with a quote of about $4000 to fix issues with my car that I didn't think even existed, plus my car was running fine! I ignored the Toyota dealership's suggestions. A few months later I drove to Utah, did some off roading and my check engine light came on a day later. I took my car into Precision Imports and they discovered that it was simply some minor alignment issues and fixed it for $45! I asked about the issues Toyota mentioned and they said they didn't find anything like that. Let's see, Toyota told me my car problems about 25,000 miles ago and my car is just fine (FYI: I have over 180,000 miles on my car).

Example two from last week. I took my car into Walmart for an oil change and to check out a slow leak in one of my tires back in February.  They say they can't find anything wrong with my tire and suggest I get a new one. I put off buying a new tire and stick with just filling it up with air about once a week.  My check engine light goes on again. I took it in to Precision Imports for my next oil change and to see if they find anything wrong with my tire. Of course they do. They found a four inch nail in the tire, patched it up and the slow leak is gone. Oh, they plugged in something that Walmart probably left unplugged too. $72 for an oil change, patched tire and to check out and fix the check engine light situation.

I don't know much about cars, but these guys...these are good guys."
positive,"I cannot recommend Mike's Auto Body enough! My husband had his car repaired here earlier this year and told me there was no other place to go after his experience there. 

I got hit at the grocery store parking lot and I was shaken up and irritated. The woman who hit me insisted on paying out of pocket so I went to Mike's to get an estimate the same day and they were able to squeeze me in. I was able to get the estimate to the woman who hit me, she sent me a check, and I got an appointment for the next week at Mike's, and I was in and out in ONE DAY. They timed everything perfectly with ordering the parts and prepping everything before I even got there. I worked with Ben and he was friendly, accommodating, and provided high quality service. My door was perfectly repaired and when I got in my car it was clean and shiny and felt years younger! My job requires me to bring a lot of mud on my boots so my car was pretty dirty, but after the treatment at Mike's it was spotless! I am beyond impressed with my experience!"
positive,Russ came thru and did a diag to pinpoint the problem with my truck and why it was running too lean. He was able to fix the problem in less than 20mins and went over the causes of the problem with me and how I could prevent and maintain it. I definitely recommend him!  Fast and professional service. No more check engine light and the truck runs great now.
positive,This is the best place to get your car repaired. Damon and Chris changed my break lights for me. I really appreciate there service I arrived at 5:59pm and the shop closes at 6 pm. They could have told me to come back in the morning for service but they chose to help me. Thanks guys!
positive,"Prompt and excellent service. Took me under my car to show me my damaged muffler. I appreciated that! As a woman I am always concerned about being taken. 
They replaced my muffler quickly and efficiently for a fair price. I was in and out in 45 minutes including inspection. 
Thanks Midas!"
positive,"Being a Las Vegas Native, this is the first HONEST mechanic I've ever come across. I first came here before my car registration renewal because of their competitive price for smog checks. The waiting room was packed and full of loyal customers. My husband went back a second time to get the transmission oil flushed, an oil change, and have the battery terminal cleaned which they did all for $100. Keep in mind the last time I got a transmission oil flush, I got ripped off and was charged $200 (I won't put the company on blast). The receptionist is friendly and so is every employee I came across. It's a shame the only ""one star"" review I found below was from a fellow that didn't even get a service, he was just in a rush and not satisfied they couldn't accommodate his restricted time frame. USA Auto Service is definitely a company I will be referring all of my family to."
positive,I had Sahara Muffler install a MagnaFlow  muffler on my 2003 Gmc Duramax.  They did a nice install at a very fair price. They even took me home and picked me up!  I wanted the exhaust  tip a little higher. I went back the next day. They re adjusted it for free.
positive,"Recently, my car was involved in an accident with some damage to the rear right bumper and fender and needed to be repaired.  My husband decided to go online and read reviews on various shops in our area including the dealership we bought the car from.   It seemed Valley East popped up and caught his attention the most so he decided to stop in and take a look at their work before we did any repairs to our car.  

I'm so glad he did.  We got our car back on Monday and I have to say I am impressed with the job they did.  Not only does the car look as it did before the accident, they seal coated the entire car before returning it to us.  

The shop is run my two guys that definitely know what they are doing.  Their quote to us was also almost $500 less then one of the other places we received a quote from.  Not only did we save money using them,  you can't even tell the was ever any damage done.  

So if you had an accident and you need your car repaired Check them out before you go anywhere else.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
positive,". I called  2  or 3 other shops before finding them on my Yelp app. The other shops left me confused and worried about what to do next. My car had been in a nasty accident. It looked bad and I was really worried about driving it. Once I talked with Rob Jr. I felt 100x better.  Rob and Rob Jr. went the extra mile to make sure I understood the process of getting my car repaired and they helped to cut through the double-talk that my insurance company was giving me about coverage. They even helped me find a rental car while my car was being worked on.  When my car was deemed a total loss by my insurance company, they still kept in contact to make sure I understood what was going to happen next. They explained the paperwork my insurance company sent  to me and walked me through the next steps. I had never been in an accident that bad before and this one happened just before Christmas so I couldn't have been more stressed out. They made things so much easier.  Throughout the process, they were always kind, patient and honest with me about everything. I honestly don't know what I would have done without their help. Thank you guys so much!"
positive,"Brought in my 2011 Impala with a oil and transmission leak, non working headlights and brake replacement . Linton was able to fix my car within 24 hours and my car runs brand new! I definitely will be going to TC auto for all my automotive needs. Linton is very honest and didn't hesitate to answer any of my questions. I also appreciate him taking the time to show me the work
He did on my vehicle!!!"
positive,I took my car into the collision center and Patrick helped me out. He made my entire experience with my car quick and easy. I had my car repaired after an accident and they did such an amazing job. I didn't have wait or worry about paperwork or contacting the insurance company. Highly recommend!
positive,"Charlie is the man! Unbelievable service, quick, fair prices and extremely nice staff and management. Not really sure why they have low ratings. I've been to Charlie probably 4-5 times, including once for my girlfriend who also loves this place, and I've been amazed every time.

First time was a flat tire and they picked up my car in about 10 minutes and fixed it that same day. Second time was for a new muffler and I was in and out same day. Couple more times for small tire things here and there and every time I call he remembers me and asks when I want it done.

Highly recommend checking out Charlie and his shop if you need anything car related done!"
positive,"2010 BMW 535i - I really really like Vitali. I took my car in for a check engine light I'm sure it was something to do with an o2 sensor or something similar. Vitali is a super nice guy and very personable. He took the time to explain things about my car and that the problem might be covered under BMW's warranty and gave me the info to look into it.

I really liked that I was able to ask him questions about my car, he's very patient and knowledgeable. I asked him different questions about things I've seen on the car and he answered them all. Very nice guy... I decided to do my oil change that was almost due with them because of the service I received... Vitali did a good inspection of my car while he was at it. I did a lot of research on shops before I took my car in. I'm glad I decided to go here. I'll be back for sure."
positive,"Brought in my BMW again for Inspection 1 service as well as a complete change of oil, coolant, differential, and auto transmission fluid. The techs found a couple of other things which were addressed appropriately. As always, service was excellent from the moment I scheduled the appointment via email to the time I picked up the keys and drove my pride and joy back home.

Big thanks to Roy and everyone at Beyer Motor Works for continuing to provide outstanding service. :)"
positive,"We have been on the lookout for a particular car with a manual transmission and low miles.  We currently own such a car (2007) and would like to replace it.  I entered my wish list on Car Gurus some months ago.  

Two weeks ago I got an alert about a similar car at Prestige Auto Mall in Cuyahoga Falls - right around the corner from our house!!  I contacted Prestige via email and within an hour ""Mike A."" from Prestige had called me.

I have dealt with car dealerships for years and have NEVER had a more relaxing, friendly experience!!!  My husband (a mechanic at an area dealership) and I drove the car and we bought it!

Due to the Christmas holidays (weekend) it took a few extra days to get the money for our purchase... in the interim Prestige was amazing!!  They were patient, they pulled the car off of their website (AND the Car Gurus website) because they respected our offer.  They even let me spend some time driving our new car when I stopped by to update them on our financing.

My husband and I are duly impressed with the professionalism and personal service we received at Prestige!!  Thank you to Mike A. and EVERYONE at this business!!!  

We highly, highly recommend this dealership!!!"
positive,"My review is for the service department.  I own a 2017 Ram Promaster that had the transmission go out on a holiday weekend. I was able to have it towed to the dealer right around closing time on the weekend and they were able to get me an on-site rental car. They diagnosed the vehicle the first business day after the holiday and kept in touch all along the way.  Very professional and top notch in communication which is a huge plus. I can't speak for the sales Dept, but when I'm ready to upgrade my Dodge Ram truck I will be returning to this dealer."
positive,"Valley Automotive is the best Auto Repair shop around. If your check engine light comes on they take the time to explain what the code means for you they also try to make it as cost effective as possible. They know what they are doing and always tell you before proceeding.

If you are going in for an oil change and work crazy hours they will even pick your car up do the repair and drop it back off. They always go above and beyond!

Just recently I had a problem with my transmission, they did everything they could to get it covered under warranty or fixed by the dealership. 

I always look for the best deal when shopping around and when it comes to automotive repairs there is no one better!!!"
positive,"SO INCREDIBLY THANKFUL!! In this day of ""what have you done for me lately?"" My experience here was remarkable. I am in retail sales and I experience daily the stigma of that ""used car salesman."" When dealing with the public in an area that they know little about. So when my transmission began acting up in my 2005 Volvo with 168,000 miles, I could only expect the worst. Got the car to Gillece Bethel Park, left a note of what it has been doing and dropped my keys through the slot. Monday afternoon when my phone rang and I saw Gillece in my caller ID, I braced myself. Rob introduced himself and asked "" when I checked fluid level, was engine running?"" I said no, and immediately felt foolish. Rob told me that fluid level was down about a quart, he added fluid and drove it several times at length and it seemed fine. What a huge relief! I was expecting a $3000+ transmission replacement, and my cost was $117 for diagnostic test, labor and fluid. 
Bottom line is that he could have easily told me I needed a new transmission, and I would have to trust him. It restored my faith in this location and it's professionals, that they are honest. If you are ever experiencing tranny issues, do not hesitate to have them check it out.

Disclaimer: This is an unpaid, unsolicted and honest review."
positive,Gallo-Miller has help several of our customers get their car repaired; they take the time to make sure things are fixed right.
positive,"The five stars is for the service I receive from Dan Adams.
If you have to take your car into a dealership, then you need to ask for Dan Adams. Our household has 3 Toyotas and they require regular service and maintenance. I had been seeing another advisor and he retired. I went down service row and was extremely dissatisfied with each and everyone. My encounter with Tony was so appalling I had to enlist the help of the service manager. I was ready to try another dealership until I got to the last advisor, Dan. And yes, they do save the best for last. His work ethic is just like the advisor that retired. He's honest, up front and personable. He's very clear on his communication and keeps you in the loop. Their shuttle drivers are all very wonderful and they shuttle people to and from all over the valley. I recently had a check engine light come on and Dan did the diagnostic check for free and gave me a quote on how much the repair would cost. He never is pushy and trying to scare you into a repair. He told me it may be going soon with the intermittant part of it and could replace it later. I am waiting on the engine light to stay on permanently which means the part would be bad, the cost is a but much, but that's to be expected of an electronic part.

I would give minus stars to the sales dept. They are the epitomy of car salesman. Aggressive and cut throat. Thank goodness my car was in the shop and I could get my keys back when they were done. If the sales guy had taken my car to check on the trade in value, I am sure I would not be getting my keys back. When my car was being serviced, I walked around the waiting area and the showroom and that was when the sales people attacked. It didn't matter that I was ""just looking"" and waiting for my car to get serviced."
positive,My check engine light was on so my mechanic said take it to auto zone for a free diagnostic printout. They did it with ease in five minutes which show a large EVAP leak detected. Thanks Auto Zone!
positive,"Nobody enjoys needing to have their car repaired and always anticipates being ripped off by the mechanic in the process.. Everyone is free to shop around and DO THEIR OWN HOMEWORK, so for the negative reviews complaining about the prices - you can always go somewhere else AND you get what you pay for... These guys definitely do what they can to work with all needs and budgets under the corporate restraints. They take care of their regulars and give off that neighborly/community vibe in welcoming new customers. There are certainly worst places you could go! I know- I've been there."
positive,"When my vehicle was in a collision involving its rear bumper/wheel, I was super depressed in knowing that I would probably be looking at thousands of dollars in repair costs via upselling by some dishonest auto shop. Then I remembered a neighbor had recommended Christian Brothers and my worries dissipated! Dean assessed the damage and found that since most the impact involved the wheel, he was able to replace only the knee assembly while bolting the bumper back onto the quarter panel. I ended up not needing to take my car to a body shop which saved me valuable time and money. Two business days later, my car was back on the road and in good shape!

Just this past weekend, I started my car on the way to the grocery store and began feeling intense vibrations from the engine while idling and stopped in traffic. I immediately thought to call Christian Brothers based on the prior positive experience and am soooo glad I did! Mike, Bryan and the team were able to find that I needed all 4 engine mounts replaced, and were able to complete the job within the same day I dropped the car off! They did an excellent job showing me the damaged parts and explaining how they should appear. They also went above and beyond in bolting down my transmission mount, which curiously was missing it's bolt (*cough* shoddy work by a former mechanic *cough*).

I wouldn't take my car anywhere else for routine repairs and maintenance. These guys are truly the best! They use factory parts to ensure quality and do not try to upsell or overcharge you. I consider it a blessing to live so close by and recommend Christian Brothers to anyone in need of honest auto work!"
positive,"They really stick with their motto: ""We only fix what's broke.""  I took my SUV in with potential transmission trouble.  I very easily could've been taken advantage of, but John was very straightforward and diagnosed a very minor issue (likely caused by a previous shop).  Charge was minimal and vehicle is working great!  Appreciate the integrity - will definitely take my vehicles back if any further issues."
positive,"I was referred to Bill at State to State by M & M Auto. I have to say this once again. We have 4 vehicles. Our previous mechanic passed away in a motorcycle accident, and it is near impossible these days to find an honest mechanic that does good work and stands by it. We had been overpaying at a big name chain for quite a long time. Anyway, we found M & M, who in turn referred us to State to State. Bill knew right away that the tranny was no good, and he gave us the cost to repair it, which was fair. The vehicle is still running. He spent about an hour of his time thoroughly explaining our options, and what to look for if we decided to purchase another car for my daughter instead of repairing this one. He also said that if we find another car to bring it in and he would check it out at no charge! So....I have found a wonderful, honest transmission shop. You will never find this kind of service at a big box shop!"
positive,"I was in town for work when the check engine light went on in my 2006 Sonata. The service department here had the lowest diagnostic fee I found and was able to work me in on the same, before I started the long drive home. They diagnosed the problem, and started fixing it right away, but when it turned out the part they had didn't fit, they confirmed that it would be safe for me to drive home and then didn't charge me the diagnostic fee, which I had already agreed to pay. They were fast, friendly, and more than fair. If I lived here I'd definitely be using them for service."
positive,"I just recently purchased a new truck from a used car dealership and after taking it into their service department a number of times for warranty issues not being resolved, I decided to take it to a manufacture dealership. I took it in for an oil change and to have the transmission looked at since the previous dealership had no idea what they were doing. Brandon in the service department took my vehicle back and after being evaluated, told me everything that was going on. He was very helpful and straight up, which was a relief after being told things just to get me outta the garage. Coming back for future visits."
positive,Last night the engine got louder sounding as I was driving. Stopped to see what was going on and noticed that no exhaust was coming out of the tailpipe. Brought my car in this morning the have it checked out. The guy seemed pleasant and immediately put my car up to have a look. He then brought me into the shop and showed me the problem (flex pipe busted). He also showed me two other areas that were starting to rust out including my muffler. I decided against getting a new muffler right away and paid to have the flex pipe cut out and replaced. The price quote was consistent with competitors. Overall I was pleased with the way my car and I were treated.
positive,"I had to have a transmission replaced on a 2001 Ford F150.  While I didn't really want to do this it had to be done and I wanted it done right.  Dave's Car Care did what they said they were going to do.  There were no ""extra"" charges and it's been 30K miles and the transmission is still running great.  My truck has 250K miles on it and I'll take it back to Dave's Car Care for any other maintenance I need to have done!"
positive,"The guys at Scottsdale muffler have installed mufflers in several of my vehicles they do very good work and if there's a problem they will fix it, no questions asked , I recommend them very highly very good guys and they know what they're doing what more can you ask for. Plus they do other things that you need done as far as custom jobs on vehicles high-performance work fabrication whatever you need done , just ask them , most , likely they can do it . I love these guys and recommend them very highly !!!!!!!"
positive,I am from out of town. My van transmission went out. Got a fair price and great works. I compared price to my local town and his price was better than that. It has been a year and no problems with transmissions. Was back in Vegas last weekend. Took my sons car to get an oil change. Great price and quick service.
positive,"""No one wants their car towed"" Horse Hockey! I definitely wanted to get my car towed. To Wallys independent Honda Acura Service center. And they recommended quality towing. As you can see from my photos I really care for my car, and it is pretty low. I called quality towing a dispatch to request a tow to the repair shop. The lady that answered the phone was friendly and professional. I wanted a tow truck that could tow my car safely without scraping the front end off or shoving the muffler up under the car or any kind of damage to the vehicle. I wanted a tow truck driver that cared about what he was doing and about my vehicle and not be in a hurry and grumpy. Well the tow truck driver I got will call him Rob M. he certainly knew what he was doing and took great care to make sure my vehicle is loaded and safely secured without any damage to my vehicle.  He even used the straps that went around the tires when he could have used a chains and tiedown the vehicle with the factory tiedowns. That little extra care to not tip the paint on the factory tiedowns and to use tire straps was greatly appreciated."
positive,Good honest service. Didn't try to upsell with $10.00 off coupon paid less than $100.00 for a synthetic oil and filter change. He first suggested an transmission oil change due to mileage but later recanted because he saw that I had just had transmission work  done. He cleared my transmission trouble codes and they haven't reappeared in the 6 weeks since then. Will use their services again.
positive,"After a less than average visit to Findlay Honda, I came to Honda West to get ish done.

I was greeted within seconds by Kyle. He let me know a service advisor would be with me shortly. 
I explained to the advisor, Ryan, I had a 15% mailer coupon that I wanted to use for a transmission flush. (Hey, I'm a student. I need all the coupons I can get). He was very friendly, gave me the total for the service, and invited me inside to wait.

It was busy today and wish I could rate the wait, but I went in without an appointment. C'est la vie. All in all I was there for an one hour and a half.

Checking out was easy! No unnecessary recommendations. I definitely would go back."
positive,"My wife and I were visiting Sun Prairie from New York City and started to have some car troubles. Turned out there was an internal oil leak that was effecting the timing belt. Randy and his team squeezed our car in and we were able to get back on the road as we had scheduled. However, about 30 minutes back on the highway our check engine light came on and we immediately called Randy. He talked me through all of my options and said that if we turned around they would drop everything and take a look at our car. He was true to his word and as I walked in he just took the keys and got right to looking at the car. He took a lot of time talking with us and explaining exactly what was going on with the car so that we could feel comfortable making the trip back to New York City. On top of all of that he was generous enough to not charge us for taking a second look at the car. 

I appreciate the care that he took in explaining all of the issues to us and making sure that we understood what was going on to cause the issues in our car and also what they did to fix those issues. The car made it back to New York City and we owe it to Randy and his team! 

I highly recommend this Midas as your go to shop when you need any work done on your car."
positive,"Was there last week do get my car repaired and tuned up. Great customer service and knowledgable employees. Allignments are only $60 there!  Compared to $100 at other places. The place was busy, but I guess that's a good sign of regular customers. Ill definitely be going there again. And the total price was fair. I've been to many other mechanics before and sometimes they try to charge outrageous fees.

Update: August 2016

Have been coming here since I originally posted
my review. I've been doing all my services here and haven't been disappointed. Especially with the pricing and quality of work. And they even did some warranty work for me. And also installed my own parts that I brought once. I must also say that they're repeatedly busy. Even though I'm impatient, sometimes it's worth the wait. Other customers here seem to have a good relationship with them. 
Two thumbs up!!"
positive,"Woke up this morning, up at the rising sun. 3 little bird on my door step, singing sweet songs... On My Way to work happy as can be... Then my car Gives me a check engine light with the Red Triangle of death... My Hybrid Battery is dead.. CODE P0A80... F@*K... Called Green Tec Auto and they got my 6. I Purchased my battery there in July 25 2018. With 18 months Warrenty. They told me to go down to the shop and they will take care of me and they did... Customer care and customer service is amazing. I was I. And out with in hours. AWESOMENESS LEVEL 1000."
positive,"Today the mercury shot up to 103 degrees, but the incredibly friendly, energetic and helpful associate came outside of the comfortable air conditioned store, eager to help and provide fantastic customer service.  

The check engine light popped on in my car.  Within five minutes he had given me the free diagnosis.  He printed out a price and details for the part, so I could comparison shop with my mechanic.  

The check out process was the kind in which your purchases are itemized in the customer facing card reader.  This way you know exactly what you are paying for.  Maintaining a great attitude, I was rang out with a handsome, friendly smile and profoundly professional care. 
        Yes I wrote it.  It was a mercilessly hot day, but never too hot that quality, chocolate doesn't look good.

Seriously, there are a few ways to save:
They have a loyalty card.
They have a number you can text to earn $5 off any purchase of $25 or more.  
They have sales and rebates.

Auto Zone is clean, parking is plentiful...  And service is great!  In a sea of auto parts store, for every good reason they stand out."
positive,"I purchased a used 2009 Hyundai Sonata for my 71-year-old mother from Great Lakes Hyundai.  I bought it off the Internet sitting at my computer in Philadelphia--sight unseen. It was such a great deal.  My mother reports that the salesmen were kind, patient, and professional.  When she got home the cigarette lighter was missing, so they drove about 20 miles to her home delivery it.  Wow!  That's service!

The car ran excellent for about two years until the transmission died.  Since the Great Lakes Hyundai car purchases included a free ""Warranty Forever"" drive-train coverage, we tried to have the insurance company pay for the repairs.  I was extremely irritated to find out the coverage was declined on a technicality:  My mother was supposed to call an 800 number before each and every oil change required to maintain the coverage, but didn't.  They also said the coverage on the transmission was invalidated because, on one occasion, she had forgotten to change the cabin air filter.  Gee, what does that have to do with the transmission being broken?  Hyundai Motor Company did pay for the parts of the repair (as a goodwill gesture) and I paid the $1200 for labor.  I was pissed off.
The ""Warranty Forever"" program is bullshit.  I assure you it is impossible to collect on the warranty because nearly everyone that owns a car will miss a cabin air filter change by a couple months or an oil change by maybe 1000 miles or some other technicality.
But, then a miracle happened.  About 15 MONTHS after the car was repaired, I was contacted by Joey Huang, the owner of Great Lakes Hyundai.  He had just learned about the failure of the warranty company to pay for the transmission repair and about my extreme displeasure with the warranty company and his dealership promoting such a lousy insurance company.  He got in touch with me in Philadelphia and apologized for my parents' and troubles with the warranty and with the car.  He said he would reevaluate the dealer's relationship with the warranty insurance company.  He offered me $1200 out of his pocket to pay for my expenses 15 months earlier!  He thoroughly convinced me that 100% customer satisfaction was his goal and he was willing to do just about anything to get it.  On the phone, he was sincere, sympathetic, and determined to make things right - - with no strings attached.

In my 52 years, I have never heard of a car dealership so concerned with its reputation.  All my future car purchases will be with this outfit for their excellent customer service, excellent prices, and for the integrity of its owner, Joey Huang.  (You'll just have to buy your drivetrain insurance coverage from someone else.)"
positive,"I have been a AAA member for a long time.  For years I took my vehicles to Marshall Motors that is only 5 blocks from my home.  I got so tired of their constant failure to properly diagnose the problems with my cars that constantly broke down in the most inappropriate locations that required towing to that garage to try and fix something that they just couldn't find.  Usual remark: We couldn't find anything wrong with your car!""  I decided to use our Firestone Service Garage for a couple of years until one day when I needed a tow the driver suggested that I go to TONY'S Auto Service on East Thomas Road.  Boy, was that good advice.  First, the personnel were so darn friendly, ready to listen to my problem, and knowledgeable enough to voice a possible fix even before they looked at the vehicle.  I have taken my vehicles to Tony's three times now and each time I was treated courteously and my vehicles repaired the same day, paying for only what needed replacement on the car.  I was immediately given a ""New Customer"" discount with a constant flow of discount coupons in the mail, ""Discount on your next visit card"" which have been applied to my bill without even mentioning it to them.  (Something I never received from the ""award winning"" Marshall Motors, even after years of patronage.)  The other day I called Tony's for an appointment to have my car towed in because it wouldn't start.  I was asked to describe the problem, and over the phone I was given the solution.  I called AAA Battery Service (who arrived within the hour, great service) and installed a new battery and my problems were over.  Thanks to the friendly advice from Tony's my day was saved I only paid for the cost of a new battery.  Every mechanic at Tony's is great and I like the fact that they take pride in keeping my old pride and joy '95 Buick in tip top shape that seems to run better than my new Honda.  I would recommend Tony's Auto Service Center on East Thomas Road to everyone who wants their car repaired right the first time by guys who really take pride in their work."
positive,"Trusted auto repair is back!

Last year, when Airpark Auto Repair in the Scottsdale airpark area was purchased by a typical auto-repair-ripoff artist, at least one of the honest folks from there found a home at Tri-City Auto Repair. This is a division of Tri-City Transmission, to which the prior (honest) owners of Airpark would refer people for specialized transmission work.

You can rest easy that Aaron at Tri-City will honestly diagnose your auto issues, recommend any repairs or service (all at reasonable prices), and also let you know which of the repairs and service are urgent and which can wait - and if so, for how long.

Most of us are justifiably terrified of taking our vehicles to the mechanics for fear of being ripped off, but Tri-City is honest and fair. 

I have ZERO reservations recommending these folks!"
positive,I found this place with a Groupon coupon for a synthetic oil change and tire rotation for $22 which was an awesome deal! They were also able to give me a high mileage transmission flush for $20 under the standard price for the service. Then they threw in an air filter for free! After getting such great service we decided to also take advantage of their car lot... we had been looking for an older vehicle to go off road in and they had a 2003 Honda Element that was absolutely perfect... and had a below blue book price! they were very helpful with in house financing and with our very small down payment! They have been great and we will continue to use them for our maintenance needs!
positive,"I called and set up an appointment with Noe to get an estimate on replacing my transmission on a 2013 Ford Escape. The morning of my appointment I met Noe who made me feel like I was very important to him and he listened carefully to me explaining my issue and how my vehicle had been in another big name company for almost 2 months to have the transmission replaced not only having the transmission replaced 2 times at that shop only to pick it up when they said it was ready, and not only was I still having transmission issues I now have roughly 1000.00 worth of damage that they have caused and refused to fix even though they broke the other parts. While talking with Noe I ask him if he could give me daily updates on my vehicle and keep me posted of his findings. The other shop would never give me updates unless I called them and would get the same response, not ready today but will be tomorrow. This went on for almost 2 months. Noe not only gave me daily updates like he said but went out of his way to ensure that I was taking care of by my warranty company. Noe told me my vehicle would be ready on a certain date and he called me on that date and told me it was ready. I picked it up and Noe did a great job fixing my transmission. The transmission shifts as smooth as it did when the vehicle was new. I recommend I Am Mechanics to all my friends and co workers and will be taking all my business to them. When you hear customer comes first this is what you get from I Am Mechanics. Thank you Noe you are great...."
positive,"I took my sedan in for an oil change last week in the first. Very next day while pulling out of the driveway in my other vehicle, I notice the sedan is leaking oil. Every day I drove it since last week, I noticed a small leak. I take it back to Mike this morning before they open. He comes back about 15 minutes later and says ""you have a BIG PROBLEM."". Then he says he's I'm all set, everything is fine . He said the seal around the oil change bolt was bad and he put a new one in. No paperwork, no fees, just handed me my keys and said I'm all set. He has been doing ALL my auto work since last year (see clean engine pictures) when he put in a used transmission in my Honda and fixed the ACs in both vehicles. My step father wrecked my Honda the day after (?) the super bowl this year and it was deemed a total loss. I took it to Mike and got 2 replacement doors and the ""hood"" and pocketed more than half the settlement. He did one other minor touch up and I was all set to go to mvd for a salvage title restored inspection. I went in a couple months ago for struts on the sedan and he got me a barely used (just as good or better than the other 3) tire for $40. This guy is totally legit, honesty, trustworthy, and just a great guy to do business with. He continues to amaze me and my limited finances make his shop the place to go for my 2 paid off ""beaters""."
positive,"I have been looking for an auto repair shop in this part of the valley so I did my research and found Christian Brothers on Ocotillo. I had two vehicles that needed attention. I suspected my daughters VW needed a brake job and was convinced my old Suburban was going to generate a much longer list of repairs including extensive transmission work. I was wrong on both counts. They called and told me the brakes on the car were still good, everything else was OK, and that there was no charge. I don't remember ever leaving a repair shop not having to pay something. 

The call about the truck was also a surprise. It did indeed need a lot of work but it wasn't as bad as I expected and the tranny is fine. They gave me a prioritized run down of everything that needed to be fixed along with parts and labor cost estimates so I can complete the work in chunks instead of taking one big hit. I appreciate that.

Its a neat, clean, polite shop that did the work on time for the price quoted and they even run a courtesy shuttle that picks up and drops off. Whats not to like. This Christian Brothers location has earned a new customer. Thank you. Wade."
positive,Gene was very accommodating in getting my wifes' car repaired and double-checking to make sure it was at its best performance.  Would not take any of our cars any place else for maintenance.
positive,"I came to Big G Tire Pro this morning when my check engine light came on and my car kept overheating and stalling out a day before I'm supposed to ship it across the country- so its an absolute must that it be fixed today. The guys at Big G Tire Pros took my car right away and were wonderful about diagnosing the problem and telling me what needed done before they did it so I could decide with my dad if it was the right path to take. I'm still here waiting for them to finish up, but so far I'm incredibly pleased with them and am grateful for their efficiency, kindness, straightforwardness, and time sensitivity. Also for a diagnostic, a new fuse, and a replacement coolant tank I'm quoted $275. I'm not a car person but I was expecting that number to be a lot higher. I'll update this review if my problem's not fixed, but I'm feeling confident that won't happen."
positive,"I cannot say enough good things about this shop. Jim diagnosed our issue quickly and gave us a very fair price for the repair. We drove all the way from Blue Diamond to go here because a friend recommended them, and it was so worth the drive. We won't go anywhere else for transmission work."
positive,"This should really be a 4.5 star review.  I've purchased lots of cars from dealers over the years.  Some good, some bad.  NONE as easy as it was with Hertz.  I bought a 2016 Toyota Prius C with just over 20k miles on it.  First off, the price was around $2000 lower than book value and it was at least $2500 lower than any other Prius I had looked at on other dealer lots.  I knew the price was fixed and it was already the lowest so I went in with the mindset that if I drive the car and like it, I'm going to buy it.   The only negoatiation was on my trade.  I went in and talked to Allen.  We took the car for a drive and I liked it.  It was in the shape advertised.  Allen and I had a good talk during the process and I enjoyed my time there surprisingly.  It was so low stress compared to when we bought a car for my wife in January of 2016.  That's an entirely differenc story, and a frustrating one.

ANYWAY, admittedly my trade wasn't worth much so when the finance/sales manager made me the offer, I took it. I was up front with him about the repairs needed to my trade and I told him what KBB had calculated for my trade and we were within $100 when he calculated the KBB trade value.  He then told me he had to go by the auction value which was a few hundred less because he couldn't sell a car older than 2007 on his lot.  Makes sense and I appreciate him being up front with me on this valuation.

So really, the only other issue was the financing. I had pre-approved through Capital One Auto Finance, which is the way to go people!  They have set maximum prices for what I can be charged for dealer fees and I was able to get a 100,000 mile 7 year bumper to bumper warranty for almost $800 less than what they would've charged.  I don't usually believe in extended warranties but there are two things I do not fully trust on todays cars, hybrid electrical systems and the CVT transmissions.  That's another story but I figured one repair to either of these systems in the next 7 years will more than pay for the cost of the warranty.

The only reason I can't give a 5 star rating is because they only had one key/fob for the car.  To get another one cut and programmed requires a Toyota dealer to do it and it's almost $300.

So yes, I would definitely purchase another car from these guys.  It was an easy and low stress experience.  As another reviewer mentioned, definitely do your research on what cars on the lot you are interested in, it's a packed full lot and when I was there on a Friday afternoon it was CRAZY busy."
positive,"This place was great. Couldn't ask for anything more. I got a check engine light for a bad sensor. They replaced the part, light is off and the car is good. No hassle, no tricks, just honest guys that I did what I paid and asked them to do. It's hard to find a good mechanic shop. This may be my new go to place. Thanks mike."
positive,"Perfect local shop. Do not go here if you are looking for cheap. Go here if you want great service at a reasonable price. Don't go here if you are looking for a 10 minute oil change. This place does great work and they are busy so most of the time I've had to leave it. But they have always kept me updated and gotten the cars done before they said or right on time. Everyone there is very nice. I've gone there for some strange things and always no problem, I.E. window came off track, wiper / blinker switch needed to be replaced, transmission fluid change, etc. They don't upsell and they won't do work you don't need. I wanted an oil change and Kris said let's wait, you still have 1K miles to go. Appreciated the honesty."
positive,"Oscar repaired a sprinkler valve for me. Great communication, friendly service, reasonable pricing, flexible scheduling. Would happily hire him again and recommend to others! A++!"
positive,"The last thing you want to hear from a mechanic is ""you may need a new transmission."" Of course at this point, whichever place you use will tell you that they don't do them. Double dilemma, after I had a quiet  cry for a few minutes, I started my research and started to ask/ search for a place that does them. Out of 6, I narrowed my search to 2 & after a brief interview with them, I chose to go to Allstate simply because Mitch spoke to me and explained to me step by step what the issues may be and all is not what it necessarily seems. My Dodge Ram was not shifting out of 2nd and Mitch told me what they would do and would let me know if they run into problems. Fortunately what he recommended worked and I still saved what could have been a couple thousand dollars. The work is solid and after dealing with Mitch, I now know that not all mechanics are out to break you. If I had to complain about something, they aren't open on weekends, but everyone has to have a life.. Thanxs to you and your team Mitch, me and my cars  are always in good hands with you.."
positive,"Went in for a quick smog check, and this place didn't disappoint. The service was prompt and courteous. I also received a quote for an oil change, a transmission flush, and shocks and struts replacement, which will come in handy when I'm ready to deal with these."
positive,"I love this place. Rashid is honest and the prices are so reasonable. What he quotes, you pay. I recently had a transmission fluid leak fixed; after I had the car home for a week, I noticed fluid on the floor in my garage. I panicked a little and drive down to the shop. They immediately hoisted the car up, checked it and showed it to me. It turns out that it was just some overspill for which he apologized profusely. 

I highly recommend Liberty Tech & Tire!"
positive,"This is going to be a lengthy review, but it will hit all of the five star points, so sit down and grab a drink! 

I've always wanted to ride, so I decided to take the MSF Course at Desert Wind during one of their weekend courses this past February. I had never operated a manual transmission and had no experience with a clutch, so I was totally nervous about riding. Well, on the first day of the class, Mike told me not to worry. Then, the following day, Jim joined the course as a co-instructor, and once again put all worries aside. For the entire three-day course, I was becoming more confident as a new rider and happy to learn a new skill. 

If you have the opportunity to take a course with these two instructors, or even one, take it! The way the material was presented to me, the way they explained each scenario, and the way questions were answered allowed me to have a deeper connection. I have only had a few teachers in my life who have taught material that well! High accolades to them! 

Friday, one week after taking the course, I had decided that I outgrew the Honda Rebel my dad gave me because he no longer wanted to ride. I needed something with a bit more power that was a bit louder, too. The Rebel was a perfect starter bike! I browsed the clothing items and picked up a few things like gloves and a bandana while debating on whether I should step into the motorcycle section. The ladies up front were friendly and very helpful. 

I decided it was time to peruse the motorcycle selection. I already had my eyes on a FatBoy, but decided to take a look at the other options. Jerry was the first salesperson to meet me and help me out. He suggested a Heritage Classic, and I was about sold. After about an hour of sitting on bikes and getting the pros and cons, Marty helped me with some numbers. 

Unfortunately, I didn't walk out with a new bike, but was happy the team was willing to sit with me for a few hours to see what all the numbers would look like. 

Monday night, I was back. This time, I saw a pre-owned blue FatBoy Lo online. My husband and I looked at the new bikes, and I decided to test out the new Heritage Classic that I sat on Friday night. Man, that rode like a dream! It was still a bit too large for me, so I wanted to look at the blue FatBoy. 

After taking the FatBoy out with Kevin (I think that's his name? He has awesome tattoos and a sweet handlebar mustache!), I asked if I could take it around the rider course to really test her out. Sold!

After a few hours, Chad had the paperwork ready. What a dedicated guy! Friendly and hilarious on top of it- we even listened to some good music while we worked on the paper work. FINALLY, we were out of there at 10:30 PM!!

After picking the bike up the following Tuesday, the issues started. First it was the headlamp going off and on intermittently. Then, the bearings were completely shot in the front wheel. Then, the battery died for no reason. Then, today, it was making bizarre sputtering noises. It felt like a never ending list of ""then, then, then,"" and I felt like I was getting annoying because I called the service department more days than I actually had the bike. 

Now, here is where the service department's superhero comes in! Gregg is amazing - I honestly don't know what I would do without him. From his professional tone on the phone, to his availability via email, that man has been there for me every step of the way! He was understanding, and each time I called, he made sure I was taken care of as fast as possible. 

Today, when I took the bike in for a sputtering noise, the team had it figured out and he explained everything to me in a way so I completely understood what was happening! I was also amazed that he was willing to have someone pick me up at work and bring the bike and I to the dealer if I didn't feel safe riding it in. I decided to ride her in since the issues were only in neutral. A few hours after being home, I received an email from him asking if I made it home OK. No odd noises, no sputtering, and nothing out of place. 

I could write a novel about the Desert Wind team, but I think I would bore the rest of the readers. Just stop in for yourself! 

Once again, thank you! Words truly can't explain how eternally grateful I am for re-igniting the passion I've had since I was little to ride and own my first Harley. From instructors, to sales, to service, I have not been disappointed. The entire team is awesome!!"
positive,"Do you know how hard it is to find a decent, honest place to take your car when it needs service?...of course you do!! I'm so glad I found Moe at CARS I had to share. I had some fluid leakage problems and after asking around and several people suggested CARS I took my car there to find out I needed a new water pump  (a very costly repair). Trying not to get ripped off and pose as a girl who knows cars I called several repair places and dealerships to ask about the price of water pumps with labor to price compare and CARS was actually offering me the best deal! They fixed my car and did other minor things that needed fixing without even charging me extra. And I have a VW, which are more complicated cars (aka a pain in the ass) and they specialize in foreign cars. I love the mom and pop feel of the shop, yet it's very nice and professional like a chain. I'm never taking my V-dub anywhere else and I suggest you give them a try next time your check engine light goes on...though I hope that doesn't happen cause it sucks. But the good news is CARS can make it suck a little less"
positive,"I recently traveled to Henderson from California. My check engine light came on as I was nearing town. I got a tow to Finley Acura.  Since it was about 8pm, only the sales guys were there. They were great and helped me get my car checked in for service the next day. Then, Juan offered to drive me to my hotel. When my car was repaired, Juan picked me up from my hotel and brought me back to pick up my car. The service crew was awesome also. What a great experience. We have loved our Acura dealer in California and the crew at Finley matched them in professionalism, helpfulness and going out of their way to provide an excellent experience.  Thanks guys!"
positive,"Midas mufflers 9550 N 90th street Scottsdale, Az 
Wow the staff there is absolutely the very best in the valley from AAA+ manager to AAA+ mechanics they can fix anything big or small, I am now a lifetime customer, Lisa and Staff You Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"OK, so I have decided to upgrade my drivers license so I can drive anything (trucks, buses, semi). To do so I needed to practice on a big semi. I found this driving school and took some practice time.

They have a big recent Volvo with manual transmission and air brake. That way you get to practice and get all the mentions on your license.

They are professional and friendly and have very low rate (which is very nice!).

I highly recommend them."
positive,I have a 2005 Dodge Ram 3500 dually diesel 5.9 cummings truck.  Prior to visiting Jim & Son's I was quoted outrageous prices to repair my transmission at two other local shops.  I called Jim &  Son's and spoke to Wayne.  He was very knowledgable and friendly.  I scheduled an appointment.  A week later I was returned my truck and my costs were $1500 LESS than the other two shops.  They even picked me up!!!!  Don't forget to ask about billet parts for you transmission too.  This place is top notch! Thank you Jim and Sons North Canton.
positive,Capitol Collision has used Allstate Transmissions for all our transmission problems and the work has always been top notch. Never had any problems and the staff there is always right on top of things and very professional. I give them my highest recommendation
positive,"Just yesterday I brought in my Volkswagen 2006 Touareg, because my check engine light was on and I needed to have it evaluated.  I checked in with Kim, who was very kind, thorough and efficient. As I was checking in, and during my time there, I heard other employees clearly explaining things to customers on the phone or in person and they all sounded so kind, considerate, and professional in their interactions with the other customers.  I enjoyed their very comfy and well-stocked waiting area which includes free coffee, donuts, and water, two credit-card vending machines, and a special area with activities available for children.  As I waited, Kim came over and asked me if I'd like to have a shuttle to go out and get lunch or a shuttle home so I could wait at home.  I was so comfortable, I decided to wait there.  Kim came over to me from time to time and clearly explained, in a very pleasant manner, what was happening with my car. A very knowledgeable mechanic, Rebecca, explained the technical details very clearly, in an easy-to-understand manner, and gave me interesting information about my car that I didn't know before, including that it's a sturdy car that was marketed towing a 747!  They also have very easy, cell-phone apply-and-sign financing options, if needed. Long story short, I left with my car that same day, in excellent working condition, paying far less than I had expected, with a courtesy passing smog check!  I am so happy!  I highly recommend AutoNation Volkswagen Las Vegas!"
positive,"First time here, I had spent hundreds of dollars at other auto shops trying to figure out why my check engine light was on, and they fixed it for a good price in less than an hour. This time, I came in to get my brakes checked, and Marcus explained every step of what they were doing. He even brought me out and showed me where the leak was, what had to come out, and why labor costs are what they are. Instead of charging me for two parts right off the bat, he fixed one first to save me money. Also recharged my AC for free! Amazing service!!"
positive,"My 1995 Ford E350 had shifting issues suddenly and without warning. Having bought the van nearly new, I had experienced these symptoms a decade ago. Additionally, my wife and I asked Pete's transmission to check the last three-speed tranny Ford made (C6) a few years ago as we'd moved from Indiana to Surprise, AZ for safeties sake. 
Pete told me the transmission had been well maintained and operated like it should on a test drive.
I considered both experiences. Like a fool, I asked the local Big O Tire store if they could install a vacuum modulator (convenient distance-wise). This external transmission component I found all three possibilities at NAPA for $24 (still, I was guessing). After our van sat the fourth day at Big O's, with no return phone calls - day four, a call came to tell me they couldn't work on my van as they couldn't or wouldn't borrow the correct scanner from any auto parts store. The ONE transmission shop I know is trustworthy, Pete's Transmission, I called and Pete said to get the van down there. The next morning, one of Pete's guys called to tell me the van is ready! He told me it was the vacuum modulator!
Pete went the extra mile to wait for the flatbed tow-truck to arrive (late) so to park in a safe place! You best go to Pete's Transmission as a franchise tranny shop WILL CLEAN YOUR PLOW; notorious for scamming people."
positive,"For years, I had stared out at the Sierra Estrella mountains wondering if I'd ever get the chance to hike to the top of Quartz Peak. I'm a Civic owner, so as soon as I heard about the sand roads and necessity of a high clearance/4x4 vehicle, I thought the day would never come (there's no way I'm buying a gas guzzling Jeep with a 30-mi each way work commute lol). That is, until I met some other awesome hikers from the Valley and coordinated an epic carpool!

We met up in downtown Phoenix and headed out in the Jeeps to Goodyear. After getting off the 10 and heading down Estrella/Rainbow Ranch roads for what seemed like a good while, along came the sand/dirt roads. And man did they live up to their reputation! Some super fun off-roading action ensued, and let's just say I was so glad I wasn't in my own little car. One of the hiking buddies advised that he once tried to get to the trailhead in his Dodge Caravan but got stuck in the sand and wrecked the transmission. Yikes!

Once we got to the trailhead (obviously an adventure in and of itself), it was a steady 5-6 mile uphill climb to the summit. There are definitely some false Peaks to conquer along the way that are grueling physically and mentally; however, once you get to the last half mile or so, it's a fairly short scramble and totally doable. 

Once you get to the top, you are greeted by a fantastic view of West Valley, South Mountain, Four Peaks, the Supes, East Valley, and the vast desert to the southwest. The way down is easier on the cardio but harder on the knees due to loose rocks so watch your step and don't rush it. Your legs will probably be sore for the next day or two but it'll be accompanied by the feeling of accomplishment! I also recommend going with a group as I did. Strength and support in numbers people! Plus, you may meet someone new and make friends along the way!

I'm not sure when I'll get the chance to hike Quartz Peak again, but now every time I look out to the west at it, the memories will never fade!"
positive,"Todd from Trophy Performance is a true honest professional. His knowledge On Porsche's is equivalent to the top mechanics at the Porsche dealership. I brought my 911 to him under duress from a nightmare situation of another body shop that mistakenly used the wrong transmission fluids causing the car to slip and sensor faults as well as having a potential catastrophic transmission failure. He calmly explained to me what his approach would be to save my transmission and did not try to take advantage of my desperation. 
He charged a very fair price as there was no guarantee that I still may need a new transmission.
He performed his magic and the car is driving like a champ again and transmission is operating excellent!
I will never go to another place in Las Vegas to service my Porsche and highly recommend everyone to visit his beautiful shop that is as nice as the dealership and it's priceless to deal with someone you can trust."
positive,"I moved into town a few months ago and had yet to find a trusty local mechanic. Last week on the way to work I hit the 40k mile mark and my car notified me it was time for an oil change. So, I called my local VW dealership for a quote on a 40k service on my VW GTI. This service calls for an Oil Change, Coolant Flush, Cabin Air Filter Replacement, DSG (transmission) Flush, and Overall Car Inspection. 

Doing some prior research I knew this was going to be a tad expensive because of the DSG Flush. However, I never expected the ""stealership"" to quote me $1,250!? I pulled the classic ""I'll need to talk to the wife about this,"" ended the call, and scrambled to Yelp to find a better alternative. 

At the top of the Yelp list was CARS. I called CARS hoping for a better price, but was also prepared with some questions on how they performed their DSG flush (it's not too complicated, but lazy mechanics often skip some vital steps). Within 30 seconds of being on the phone with the owner/manager, Moe, I was sold as a lifetime customer. He showed not only great attention to detail, but also incredible knowledge on VW/Audi vehicles and their maintenance quirks. 

I was able to drop my car off the next morning at 10am and their servicing was completed before 2pm. The total cost was drastically lower than the dealership, coming in around $700. While I waited for the work on my car to be completed, I was shown around their shop, given complimentary drinks, lounged on the couch, and eventually took a 5 minute Uber to the Strip!

Highly recommended this shop to anyone needing work done on their car. From routine tune-ups on your daily driver, to performance modifications on your track car, the gentlemen at CARS know their stuff.

They're family owned/operated and support out troops too!"
positive,I took my truck in for drive train oil change . They were great They did front and rear differentials transfer case and transmission . Front desk was friendly as well as technicians. I will be going back again thank guys
positive,Had many issues with my van and the warranty company said they wanted a second opinion made me tow it from Christian Brothers whom stated it was an engine issue to Stateline. Stateline diagnosed faulty transmission and had me buy a new transmission...well 3 months later same issue and now they are stating engine related. If I would've kept it at Christian brothers  I wouldn't be without a vehicle for the 4x since November. Plus they had great and responsive customer service. Only place I would recommend!!
positive,"I needed a smog check and found this place on Yelp.  The price, at $7.77 for emissions/smog is unbeatable (ask front receptionist for details).  I arrived at 5:35pm (closing time was 6:00) - Everyone that assisted me was friendly and helpful -- which was amazing, especially since it was the end of the workday and I'm sure they were eager to get home.  It's refreshing to see employees who actually enjoy their jobs!

About the smog check -- bad news...my car didn't pass. However Daymon, the manager explained that I just needed to drive around a bit, then bring it back to retest. He didn't charge me at all which was awesome, and when I did get back in, it did pass!! Daymon thoroughly reviewed the results with me, pointing out a few things (brake & transmission fluid levels, etc) and I was on my way, certificate in hand. 

This is one of the only auto repair shops I've encountered that didn't try to sell me any extra services. It's hard to find a reliable, honest mechanic nowadays --  This is one place I will definitely be using for future services/work. I highly recommend checking this place out for your auto repair/smog check needs!"
positive,Very honest service. I thought I might need a new muffler/exhaust. AML advised it was just a repair ($75) and they did a great job. Have always been very satisfied with their service.
positive,"I was originally going to give Bell Ford a 3 but since this location has such a great Manager by the name of Colby I gave it a 4. He really did a good job cleaning up a mess left by a not so smart worker. This company should  be proud of having him around to take good care of customers. I will probably never go back here, since my experience  for repairs did not go as smooth as it should have. $2000 later and my check engine light is still on. Wanted to also thank the kind thin older gentleman with grey hair who was so attentive and caring to me and my husband. I  believe his name was Jim. 

The location is clean has free drinks and snacks for  customers. I nice lounge area and a friendly environment."
positive,"Had the most amazing customer service today with 101 towing! My transmission went out in my truck and not only were the drivers KC and TJ friendly and funny, they were super fast! They had my car up and loaded within 15 mins! Ive never trusted my truck with any tow company but 101 towing has business for life! Both KC and TJ assured me that my truck was loaded safely and secured. They also went above and beyond by running my house keys back after I forgot them. They laughed and said ""you might want to get into your house later!"" I swear you would think I lost my head! But all in all my experience with KC and TJ and 101 towing was amazing and I can't wait to refer them to EVERYONE!!!! if you want amazing service ask for KC or TJ!!!!"
positive,"I AM SPEECHLESS! Truth be told, in the last two years, along with the political environment we've been in, this environment which has served to divide us as Americans, I've noticed that most people you meet are just out for themselves. When you go to a service provider for help, all you can do is bend over and be ready for the service provider to screw you. This is the reason why, when my newly purchased 2007 Mercedes Benz R320 DCI started to give me trouble with what looked to me like a problem with the transmission and I had to search for a servicer who would be more familiar with this issue than my mechanic, it was hard for me to pull the trigger and bring the car into Gillette Transmission.

After two conversations on the phone with Bob, I was able to roll the dice and see what would become of this troubling issue. In our phone conversations, Bob was helpful and professional. When I called back the second time, he remembered our previous conversation, and even stated with caution and respect, he was frustrated with me because I was driving a car that if I just brought in, might be repaired for less than if I drove the car until it had a catastrophic event. there was something in that statement that gave me comfort, going into the abyss of the unknown.

I had the vehicle towed to Gillece, all the way over in Bethel Park... I waited. The next morning, I received the call from Bob. My expectation was he would be calling to confirm I'd be spending somewhere between $3500-$5000 for a rebuilt transmission. That was about the best case I could find on line for replacing, or repairing my transmission. At the dealer, I could expect a whole lot more. When Bob called, Immediately, he told me what he had done to the vehicle. (He had added about a quart of transmission fluid to the car, and then rattled off a few other things about settings in the electronics of the transmission he had cleared and reset so the car could learn my driving style.) My head was then floating around in the $500 bill area. Bob and I chatted about Mercedes Benz vehicles for a bit, and I found how truly knowledgable he was with the cars. He told me he wanted to look at it for a little longer, but assured me there were no codes that indicated there was anything wrong with the transmission. He pointed out a couple oddities he saw in the vacuum system, and suggested that the air filters or the turbo could be where the issue was. He suggested another shop down the road that might be able to isolate where the real problem was. I have a good mechanic in Ross who is a certified MB mechanic, and I've opted to go back to my regular guy to search down where the problem really lies, outside of the transmission. (My Mechanic was not ready to go deep into the transmission issues, so earlier he had suggested the MB Dealership... I was not prepared for there prices, so I thought I'd go with Bob.)

The long and the short of this story is here: In my dealing with Bob at Gillette, I have renewed faith that there are some people, and businesses out there who are still doing business in good faith and a respectable manner! I would recommend to ANYONE who is on the fence about ripping the bandage off the would, you do it with Bob! I have full faith in his business ethics now, and if I am to EVER have even a little question in my head whether or not I have a transmission issue, I'm going to Bob at Gillette in Bethel Park! 

Oh... By the way, my final bill was $153.00. And as far as security goes with my knowing that I've now had two opinions that there is nothing serious going on with my transmission, anyone who says, ""but you still paid $153.00, you just don't get what I've been saying here. Bob addressed only what he suspected might have been of issue. My car drives better now as it makes it's way through the gears, because he also took the time to reset the driving settings so the car can learn how i drive now.

Alas, I just want to thank Bob for the follow up call on Monday to make sure all was good! More than anything, I want to commend Bob on every bit of my experience with him! Go Gillece!!!"
positive,This place is super great. Went in to get my transmission checked and they were super reasonable with the price and explaining everything to me. I would definitely recommend to anyone that wants to reliable to work on their car.
positive,"Had a transmission issue driving in the heat from LA. After I was towed to Nissan they diagnosed the problem. They had to order the part, i had to stay an extra four days...they
gave me a loaner car. The part came they installed it and they couldn't update all the settings.

They contacted Nissan tech support they sent a part right away. I left came back five days later. They were attentive and did a great job...thank you.  BobD"
positive,"I thought I'd wait a while to write-in.  Like 3+ years?  We were having trouble with our '97 Saturn's transmission.  Mgr Steve got the trans rebuilt in less than a wk, for a very fair price.  After three, going on four years now, transmission has performed flawlessly.  Do I recommend Choice?  You bet!"
positive,"I was passing through town on my way to the NHRA Nationals, when my check engine light came on, and my engine started running rough.  R&M's fee for diagnosis was fair, so I dropped the car off.  Within two hours, they diagnosed a sensor issue, and the car's computer needed a programming update.  Dan informed me that R&M has the same capabilities as the dealers do, and they even did the programming, in-house!  Very impressed.  Robert and his crew are fast, courteous, and they know their stuff.  I would even recommend this shop to my own mother.  Thank you so much, guys!"
positive,Tried Lowery's based on Yelp reviews and my first visit was great. Same day transmission check-up & maintenance was done professionally and at a significantly lower cost than three other shops I checked with. They also discovered a burned out light bulb on my vehicle and just replaced it as a courtesy. I recommend them and will definitely go back.
positive,"I am in the car business, and so I get to see a lot of body shops. These people are definitely professional, from the receptionist to the manager, all the way out to the body shop technicians.

These are the people to trust to work on your complicated car and there is a reason that CERTIFIED is in their name. They are manufacturer-certified by Mercedes Benz, Infiniti, Nissan and other carmakers. That is a high honor in the body shop business.

Throughout the process of having my car repaired, I was treated with respect and professionalism. I call it ""turning back the clock"" on my car, because now it looks almost brand new, and there is no sign of any accident!"
positive,"I'm getting ready for a road trip this weekend and my oil change was already overdue. I decided to try Jiffy Lube since it's so close to work rather than the larger place I usually go to. 

The tech Marcos and Manager Jose were so friendly and efficient. I was able to get my oil change and even my transmission service quickly. It was less costly than my regular place and I made it to work on time; there was no need to take the Lyft to and from work to pick up my car since it was completed so speedy. I had a cup of coffee while I waited in the 7 o'clock hour in the morning. 

Thank you -I'll be coming back again."
positive,First off I gotta give kristina a 2 thumbs  up. She's the best service writer I've ever dealt with.  The shop employees are just as quick and awesome.  I went in for a check engine light and she got me a new catalytic converter covered just outta warranty replaced at no charge and it was completed in less than 24 hours.  For that type of service I'd definitely buy another Kia 100%. Way to go team!! I've been to dealerships in California that would take weeks even a few months for approval and shop work. This is the best dealership I've ever experienced in over 25 years.  Thanks so much I'm glad I found my trustworthy place!!! I'd recommend this place to anyone with a Kia or looking for one
positive,"So I just had an update over with the owner that fixed my car the past 4 times and did a marvelous job. This guy knows what he's been doing it for 30 plus years. He has highly trained professional to work on your cars. We spoke today and he offered me excellent services with prices. This is the place to go when your bmw breaks down and they'll do the best to check up what's wrong with us and get it fixed same day or the next. Thank you again Fred for fixing my car and the fabulous next day services. I mean transmission got fixed, mounts, and a bunch of other stuff, what can I say this guy knows what he's doing and does it fast."
positive,"These guys are top notch. If you need a transmission rebuilt or serviced, this is the place to go."
positive,"This shop is the nicest Porsche shop in Las Vegas
They rebuilt my 2002 911 engine and performed transmission work. 
Top to bottom, these guys know their stuff
Thank you team trophy performance"
positive,"Great experience, went there after getting a 4,300 dollar estimate from a transmission shop across the street from them. They took a look at the same codes my vehicle had that the transmission shop saw and went right to my issue which was 300 bucks. I was basically a walk in customer that they squeezed in as i live on the other side of Charlotte. Car is running like a charm now. I appreciate their honesty and attention to detail. I definitely will go back to get routine service jobs to my maxima."
positive,"I took my Mazda here to get a transmission and power steering fluid change. Other places had quoted me over 200 and they were able to do it for 145! My car runs great again and they were super friendly, I would definitely recommend!"
positive,Very honest mechanics. When my cars transmission was on the fritz I took my brothers advice and took it to the dealership for repairs. They told me it would be $1000 and I would have to leave my car there for a week. I took it to competition and set up an appointment instead. I was charged just short of $500 and the repairs took only half a day. He even told me that if this didn't work to just trade in the car because putting a new transmission in wasn't worth it.
positive,"I have a good friend that owns an elite European service shop here in Vegas. In January 2017, I needed major transmission work on my Tahoe and asked this friend if he knew a good reputable transmission shop? He said he uses Competition Transmission and sends his friends and customers there for all transmission needs. I chose to have a complete replacement installed that came with a 3 year unlimited warranty. Two years and 4 months later I had a very minor growl develope in the transmission when idling. I took it back and Jim listened to it with a stethoscope because the noise was that minor. He said they were going to replace it, free of any charges. My daughter has used the shop as well and was very satisfied with their service. Their excellent customer service exceeded all my expectations. Like my friend, this is the only place I would ever recommend to a loved one or friend. Jim at Competition Transmission is both honest and trustworthy, everything thing you want in a specialty shop."
positive,"Very friendly, very kind and honest. A simple fix to a check engine light which could have been passed off as almost anything and I wouldn't have known the difference. I appreciate the quickness, thoroughness and politeness. Hopefully, I won't need to go there again but if I do it's my first choice for a mechanic."
positive,"Had some trouble with my 435i while in Vegas (""drivetrain malfunction"", check engine light, etc.).  Frantically searched for a decent shop in the area to diagnose the car.  Was happy to stumble upon these guys.  Open on Saturday, five star reviews, and specialists in all things BMW.  Spoke with Alex on the phone and gave him a heads up of the issue, and when the car was brought in, he looked at it immediately.  In my mind, I was expecting a three or four digit repair bill.  Instead, Alex did a thorough test of the vehicle and found no permanent errors stored in the computer (meaning it was a one time issue, potentially related to the high desert heat).  He reset the CEL, and did a multi-mile test drive to verify.  No charge for the diagnosis.  Amazing.  Can't recommend these guys enough.  They will be my go-to shop whenever I'm in Vegas."
positive,"Bill MacMaster came highly recommended by an auto mechanic I trust.  My mechanic sends all his transmission work to Bill at State To State, and has for many years. 

I have a 2000 F-350 Powerstroke with over 200k on the drive train.  I bought the truck new, so I remember what it was like to drive it in brand new condition.  It now feels like a new truck again.  

Bill checked the truck and gave me an accurate estimate.  He explained the possible variables with my vehicle, and told me there might be a handful of things that could be worn out within the transmission once they opened it up.  No way to tell otherwise.  He explained in detail what the charges would be if they found these issues.  I appreciated his knowledge of my vehicle, his wealth of experience working with them and his forthright explanation of what I could expect.

He did a complete rebuild.  The charges were well within the estimate (no surprises!), and my truck runs great.  Plus, he took care of a few non-transmission related details to boot.  What more could I ask?  

Don't hesitate to give Bill a call and hire him to do your transmission work.  What is an honest transmission mechanic who knows how to do things right worth?  If you've ever had the wrong guy doing your repairs, you know the answer to that question.  Bill is the RIGHT GUY."
positive,"By far the best service I've ever experienced at an auto shop. Moe is a brutally honest mechanic not in the business of taking your money. My car started with transmission problems and moe let me know that it was best to get rid of it because ctv's are expensive and it would cost more to fix than the car is worth. I called around and other mechanics were saying the same thing but their prices are between $1,000-$1,500 higher. I decided to take my chances with the bad tranny. A few weeks later my car had severe overheating problems. He let me know that he was skeptical about doing work on it because he didn't want to charge me for a quick fix if it was actually a problem a serious problem that would require a new engine. Luckily it wasn't and it's been fixed and has yet to overheat since. My car was fixed within 5 hours of dropping it off. He also offered to drop me off and pick me up knowing I had no other transportation. This is a very community oriented shop with great prices and hospitality. 10/10"
positive,"I have been doing business with Competition Transmission for over 20 years now.  I have had them service and rebuild transmissions and differentials in four of my cars, all with high mileage (150K-200K).  The rebuilt units always work as good as new and last longer than the original.  I have never compared their pricing to other shops and don't need to since I have always felt what I paid was a strong value compared to the quality of work they do and parts they use."
positive,"I was lost! Tired of shady repair shops! My buddy recommended Whitey's and I'm glad I went there! Great guys! I took my car in and they diagnosed the problem for me, unfortunately they could not repair it there because they do not do transmissions. Many shops do not, you have to go to a transmission shop. He apologized and didn't charge me anything!! I was shocked! He was honest and steered me to another shop. They recommended Tri City Transmission. I'm going back to Whiteys to service my car from now on. Thank you!!"
positive,"Great services, Roland was amazing as was the staff. I really want to say thanks to Ultimate Collision for their professionalism and repairing my car to look like new again.

I highly recommend them to anyone who needs there car repaired."
positive,"Very helpful, friendly, quick service and reasonably priced. My daughter's car broke down and we had it towed in to C&S based on Yelp reviews. They were very helpful on the phone when I called to see if they could help with a possible transmission problem. Turned out she ran over a curb and messed up the radiator and hoses. They got her car back in working order shortly and for a fair price. They were really patient about answering all of my detailed questions too. Daughter says her car runs better than it did before she messed it up."
positive,"The check engine light on my 2011 Kia Sedona came on, I took it for a diagnostic test at Complete Auto on Flamingo and Fort Apache, they told me it was the cadillac converter and it was a part that can only come from the dealer, and it would cost $1500. I called Mexicali tire shop and muffler, the guy said he can replace it for $270 with a universal cadillac converter. I took it to him he told me it would be 3 hours, he was extremely polite helpful and gave me a one year warranty. He completed the work on time and told me if I had any problems to call him back. I would highly suggest this muffler shop."
positive,"I've taken my car in for repairs twice at Paradise Auto Body and I had pleasant experiences both times (despite the reasons I had to repair my car). Jessie, Jackie, and the rest of the crew were kind and made sure that I was comfortable with everything happening since these were my first experiences of needing to have my car repaired. I highly recommend taking your vehicle here if you're in need of repairs."
positive,"This place is the best. I've come here for car work and oil changes and they are always incredibly helpful and have competitive prices. I had the check engine light come back on after they did some work last time, so I brought my car back and they made sure everything still looked fine. I've recommended them to several coworkers who also have not been disappointed. I refuse to go to the dealer anymore if I don't have to. These guys always fit me in whenever I need car work done and are awesome to work with. Thanks Reliable for taking care of my car!"
positive,best muffler shop in town got my dual exhaust super 10s done here 45 years of exprience knows what hes doing
positive,"I went to this place to get a mid muffler duel exhaust system installed on my 2007 mustang. The two people who own the shop are a father and son team. I bought my exhaust system online and had them install it for me. It was kind of a long wait but it wasn't their fault it was the exhaust systems fault. The exhaust system I bought was known for being tough to install. The two people working there were very nice and offered me a soda while I waited. The owner said ""I never let anything leave my shop unless it's quality"". When they were done they called me out to look at it and asked me if it looked good. It looked great and was very professional. When they started it up it sounded amazing and they did a few revs to make sure it was up to my standard. It ended up costing $300 but a big chunk of that was because it was a tough install. They said that if it wasn't as tough of an install it would've been cheaper. I was very satisfied and I will definitely come back with more business."
positive,"Had my cat stolen last night and searched for a muffler repair shop, when I stumbled across Sahara's. Eduardo hooked me up with his dad Carlos. Carlos did a great job at welding the magna flow after market. Now I can resume my daily grind. Thanks Sahara mufflers! BTW, fair pricing as well. Go check them out. You've got nothing to lose but money to save plus quality work."
positive,"Blown away by service AGAIN by S&S. Called to have a price quote done for transmission fluid change a little over a week ago was quoted a little over $199. Expected on our 4Runner, if not more, since you have to reach out to the dealer for the fluid and it's a service that gets done, what, once maybe twice in a car's lifetime if you're lucky? Couldn't get me in for a while most likely because of the 4th of July holiday and having to get the fluid again from the dealer (note that the last several times Wr have taken our vehicles here, they were pretty much next day or same day service!). No big deal at all as I'm taking all of these known things in my head. We got it in when our family's schedule fit which happened to be today. Had an appt at 9a and took it in at 8 as a drop off - was in no hurry to pick up since I had the day off- obviously just wanted it back before they closed. After kids had their nap I hadn't heard any updates if it was done or not so I called around 2 to get an update. Talked to Rob and he said they were running a little behind and he'd get me with a technician to get a more accurate time frame. Quoted me around 5, no big deal. Called me around 3:30 and it was ready for pick up. Arrived and the service had been discounted. I was not expecting that at all so I wasn't sure if it was just an original
Mis-quote (doubt it because again, it's a service that gets done usually once in a car's lifetime as far as I know) or if it's because of the delay (which again was no big deal for us because we planned for it) but it was a nice surprise. S&S also had an optional discount that just sits in our account until we want to use it - which is provided by them when you initially bring any vehicle in for any service (our first time visit we were told this, awesome!). I thought that capped off our visit today and when I got back in our car to leave, I found 2 TY beanie babies in the kids' car seats. Unbelievable, who does that!?!?!? THIS is why we take our vehicles here and recommend over and over. Thank you S&S!!"
positive,"I got my license when I was sixteen but didn't become a full-time driver until 1997 after having kids and the need for an automobile.  My biography aside I have always been on the search for a decent, honest, non-slimy car technician.  I finally found it!!!!  It took 13 years but I will save all of you the pain of being ripped off and lied to by a sneaky grease monkey.  When something happens to my car I used the usual descriptive that we all do, it's making a squeaky sound or it goes vroom vroom chug chug.  I honestly haven't had huge problems but that's the point.  If I need new brakes, tires, muffler, battery or just an oil change they do what is needed and not beyond.  I've never been roped into the old,  well you also need shit!  As a women I feel comfortable here.   They treat you like you know as much as them and explain exactly what they are doing step by step.  The owners name is Paul Jr. a very classy business man.  

n.b. i really give it a 4.5,  less .5 because it`s far for me but hey on yelp 4.5 is good enough"
positive,"It may seem odd to write a review for a garage that did not service my car, but Walter's deserves it. After experiencing some issues with my 2011 Nissan Rogue during highway driving, I scheduled an appointment at Walter's to have him take a look. After growing up with a mechanic father, it was important to do research, read reviews, and try to find somebody trustworthy. 

When I took my car in, we went for a test drive to try and duplicate the issue, but were unable to. Tim ultimately checked the vehicle's computer and checked on some of the engine parts that could be the culprit. When he couldn't pinpoint the problem, he apologized and didn't even charge me for his time. A Nissan dealership couldn't even pinpoint it, to be fair though. It was only after a lot of searching online that we found out what I was experiencing was the beginning of the CVT transmission going out. 

We decided to upgrade to a newer vehicle at that point, but I would not hesitate to trust Tim and his crew with our new car too."
positive,Just wanted to Express our thanks to everyone at Christian brothers for helping us get back on the road. We were headed back to washington state when our transmission heated up. We decided we better go back to sun lakes. We took the car in Monday morning. We explained our dilemma that it was urgent to get back on the road as soon as possible. They told me to leave the car and they would see what they could do. They called at 4:00 PM that day and fixed the problem . We were back on the road the next morning. The transmission performed great with no issues in our 1500 mile drive. This is the second time they have taken care of our vehicle when needed. They are always very helpful and knowledgeable.  Thanks again to all of you. It's nice that we have found such a great auto repair shop to help us.
positive,"Great service, affordable prices, my check engine light was on for a year, all repair shops that I went to wanted to charge me way more than Choice transmission did. They are the best, they were honest with me, They went the extra mile and performed a free inspection on the vehicle. I recommend this place for minor and major repairs."
positive,"I was having a car issue, specifically the transmission,  and took it in to get it checked out. Keith had the workers look at it and they said they couldn't find any issues with it or any leaks. They hooked my car to a diagnostic tool and found a couple issues but the part I really appreciated was they told me that they can't work on it because they aren't certified in the type of car it was, a Honda hybrid. I really appreciate the upfrontness and the honestly, which is rare with the world of mechanics. I asked how much it would cost for the diagnostic and they said free of charge. I would come back here again for my truck for sure!"
positive,"This is our go-to auto garage.

It began as just the place we got our smog checks done, but grew to getting our oil changed here as well as bigger ticket items.  Most recently, they have my SUV a scheduled and needed transmission flush and fixed a problem with our VW's intake manifold.  Things were done on budget.

If I had one complaint, it would be that the waiting room is much too small.  Good thing they'd next to an Arby's and Sago's."
positive,"Beyer Motorworks are honest, respectable, quick, passionate about their work, fair in price....ye(l)p - this company is fantastic! It is difficult enough being a girl in a man's world, and the world of auto mechanics is  precisely that...am I right?

Beyer Motorworks specialize in BMW and Volvo and have been in the Valley since 1987...Roy, the owner is always there,  gives the car a final 'once over' and calls you personally with follow ups....call me old-fashioned, but there is something about that type of customer service that is gripping, and will keep me coming back! 

I have been getting regular oil changes there for the past year and have taken her there for additional issues including a new horn, muffler, brakes...(actually the brakes issue ended up being resolved with a minor $60 cable replacement - their honesty saved me at least $400!!!!!) 

I will definitely take my MINI there for all other repairs moving forward...no one else compares.

AND, they have a shuttle service! (Dale the driver) has the coolest mustache ever.

positive,"Teddy is nicest auto repair boss I met so far. My car transmission was broken on my way back from Zion to San Diego on Sunday one week ago. Then it was towed to his store after I searched the open auto repair on Sunday. He was not there. His employee mike helped us to check the car. Second morning, teddy contacted me that he could help on my car and talked to my warranty company. Then he helped fix my car and I just paid few hundred dollars out of my pocket. And he asked his guy to go to airport to pick up us when we flied back to pick up my car. 
So this place is a reliable auto repair especially for the travelers like me who don't know Las Vegas well. Make sure talk to Teddy instead of some employee there who might charge higher price than Teddy."
positive,VERY SATISIFIED! I took my recently restored 1968 Cutlass to Allstate to fix a transmission leak. Apparently the trans is an odd one - a 2 speed  automatic.  Mitch looked at it and gave tne option of repairing the leak or upgrading to a Turbo 350 3 speed.  Decided to do the up grade and I am so happy.  Price was very fair and it was done on time.  Car runs and shifts like new!  Lots more get up and go too!  They did a great job and even pointed out a couple of issues my restorers missed.  I highly recommend Allstate Transmission.
positive,"I was very hesitant to visit Bell Ford today after multiple servicing issues with their sister-site in Peoria. The manager at a repair shop near to me seemed confident that it was a transmission issue and told me it'd be my best bet to still check with Ford before going and spending hundred if not thousands with a third party company. I'm very grateful that I did go to Bell Ford after all. Specifically, I'd like to talk about Anthony Alfieri. From the beginning he was clear in what I could expect and he kept everything black and white. He is very approachable and it was easy to determine what my next steps needed to be. After only a short visit with him, he quickly came up with a solution that really saved me in probably more ways than he knew. As a single mother a broken down vehicle is probably one of the less significant struggles I handle in my life but it definitely makes all of the other struggles that much harder. After speaking with Anthony, it was easy to stay optimistic that I really was going to have support in finding a way to get me back to what is most important, being able to easily get back to working and providing for my family. As I briefly spoke about prior, my experience with Ford since the date of purchasing my vehicle has been a nightmare and although I don't feel the need to go into those details at this time I do want to say that if there is any expectations that should be in place for Ford's brand and servicing, I was thoroughly impressed with Anthony and it truly was refreshing. I just might bring my car back to Ford directly for servicing in the future ONLY because of him and also the lovely gentlemen that worked on my car so quickly. I appreciate Anthony so much for taking pride in his job and truly going above and beyond for his customers. He did all of this without really knowing I had multiple terrible previous experiences with Peoria Ford and that I was a single mother. So thank you."
positive,I was looking on carguru for a vehicle. I went to several car dealerships and didn't see anything I liked. Also just didn't get any good vibes from them. I stepped into certified clean cars and immediately was greeted by David Archuletta. He had warmth and treated me like a friend not just a client. Very personable and very efficient on what my likings are. I asked him about several cars and them about a manual transmission. He helped me find the car I wanted. When we went back into the office so he can show me the car fax and the Kelly blue book (which they sold it lower than it was) I was also introduced to there team. Swell and very knowledgable bunch of guys. From sales reps to owners to finance reps. I Highly enjoyed the lot. OVERALL my experience with this company has been painless and well a adventure which I would do over anytime. I honestly felt connected and like a friend or family then just another client. I would highly recommend checking this place out.
positive,"I have a mid size, first generation rare V8 GMC Colorado Crew Cab.  After a lesson on the various brands we chose a pair of MagnaFlow mufflers.  The typical engine is an inline five and there was ample room for a single exhaust. After plan A and B we picked layout  C and the design was chosen.  Dual exhaust with two straight pipes out the back.  Looks amazing and sounds even better.  Job well done guys, you are a great team!"
positive,"I have been taking my car to Larry since 1987. Most honest guy you will ever meet. First time I took my car to him, it only cost me $12...after a chain transmission shop said I needed a complete tranny overhaul, for $1800.00."
positive,"I stumbled across this coffee shop while getting my car repaired at a local shop.  I used yelp to find coffee and this one so thought I would give it a try and was I surprised! The coffee was fantastic! I had an almond milk piccolo served in a nice mug with a beautiful heart design in the foam. The staff was veeerrryyyyy friendly and I had regretted eating just before because I saw a wrap that looked amazing! I've found a few small coffee jems that I love but this is the first one that also serves food that looks amazing AND won't kill my diet like all the other pastries. Don't get me wrong they have pastries but it's nice to find a place that has it all; nice lunch, great atmosphere outdoors and indoors, amazing coffee (with the foam designs) and friendly staff."
positive,"BILL IS THE MAN!  Here's my story. 

I'm 22, just moved here from Texas on my own, and have absolutely no family out here. my car broke down on Tuesday night in the middle of the US 60 down in MESA on my way home from work and I was TERRIFIED. I took it to a shop near my apartment at first and they kept my car for two days - telling me they would call me with any updates. i didnt hear anything from them. finally I had to call them to figure out what was up and they told me my entire transmission was shot and i would need to pay AT LEAST $1500 for a USED transmission (their words). I didnt trust it so i said fuck that and started calling around. I actually called a place closer to my home that RECOMMENDED Bill's shop. their exact words in response to my problem were ""this guy is the ONLY guy in the Valley I trust. he is incredibly honest, fair and wont throw out a transmission unless he absolutely has to. call him, his name is Bill."" 

you KNOW that says A LOT about someone if another shop recommends him and his services over their own. 

So long story short, I got my car up to Bill's shop and told him what was going on. I dont know SHIT about cars - so usually people try to take advantage of me, but Bill didnt. he went on to tell me the different kinds of things that could be wrong just based on my half-assed explanation of what happened. he knows his shit, hes been doing this for 40 years!!!!

When I got there to talk with him, he sat me down after inspecting my car and said that he was going to do some research and see if my transmission could be covered in FULL at the Ford dealership down the road. he said he would rather me be happy than have to charge me a ton of money for a problem that Ford could fix themselves! he said that he would call around and get back to me in a day or two but about an hour after seeing him, he calls and says ""I'm about to make your day"" and tells me that SURE AS SHIT, IT IS COVERED IN FULL!! thanks to Bill, I wouldnt have known!!! 

I wish I couldve paid him for his kindness and I wish I couldve paid him for any work that he couldve done on my car because I already KNOW it wouldve been a quality job.  

Anyone this HONEST and this RELIABLE and this TRUSTED and this WELL RESPECTED and LOVED around the community is someone WELL WORTH TAKING YOUR BUSINESS TO!!!! 

thank you Bill!!!!"
positive,"I was able to walk in at 4PM on a Monday with my muffler tip, where as other shops were completely booked up and get a completely new pipe, along with the new one welded on. In total, the price was very reasonable and they took me out back to show me exactly what they were doing as well as let me angle the pipe to my preference. Very cool guys there, did exactly what I wanted in less than an hour with an hour to close. Quick service, highly recommended."
positive,"If you have transmission problems....this is your place.  The staff are amazing, the work is excellent and the cost is highly affordable!  This was a great experience and I will definitely use them again if need be."
positive,"I took my '95 Ford F150 4x4 in for a replacement of the front transmission seal.  I dropped it off when they opened on Monday Morning and the Mexican American gentleman told me that they had a free rack and they would get it on the rack right away.  He said they would call when they were finished.  This was an in and out R&R with now major issues with the tranny.  The truck had only 81,000 miles and was shifting flawlessly.  When I hadn't heard from them by 4 PM on Tuesday I called and Ericka told me that they were just putting it on the rack and it would be finished on Wednesday.  No call on Wednesday by 3 so I called again only to be told by Ericka that it was just going up on the rack.  On Thursday morning, I drove back to the shop on west Polk (I live in Tempe) and the truck was sitting in middle of the shop, pretty much where I had seen it the day I dropped it off.  I went in and talked to Ericka who told me it was gong up on the rack immediately.  I saw that the truck had been moved while we were talking and someone was getting the rack ready for it.  I waited until I actually saw it on the rack before I left.  The work was completed that day.  I don't mind the wait, I mind getting jerked around.

All in all, Pete seemed like a decent guy, the truck was done very professionally, the tranny worked great and the price was right.  They also replaced the rear main seal while the tranny was out.  I would highly recommend them.  The shop doesn't look like much but they are knowledgeable and always courteous.  I would do business with them again even though the drive for me is significant.  I owned and operated my own transmission repair shop in Tucson for a number of years and realize the problems that can occur."
positive,Andrew is the only one in town who took the time to get my 308 past emissions. He built a muffler system and got it through every year. He knows older Ferrari's and other exotics... He saved me a lot of money and headache.
positive,"I have a 2004 Prius. I prefer driving used cars as opposed to new. This had been in our family since 2004. My step mom bought it brand new. I got it 3 yrs ago. A month ago it had some ""dealership service only"" issues. I fixed that then 2 days ago I got a P0A80 code when my warning lights n check engine lights came on and I had Auto Zone run codes for me. I called the Dealership who was offering the same brand new Toyota battery for the same price as Greentec but their Warranty was only for a year. Greentec's is 4 years. They came to my house and installed it in about 45 minutes and I was on my way to run errands. Again, I got an actual Toyota Battery from them with a longer warranty and cheaper install than the dealership. If u ever need a hybrid battery this is the most competent company you will find in Las Vegas. I called, they took my order, we paid and the mechanic was at my house an hour after their shop opened. I've just got back from running errands. Already my ac is cooler and my gas mpg has risen. It's like a brand new car inside and out. Thanks Greentec"
positive,"As I read through the other reviews, I can't help but keep in mind that not everyone can be won over-- I, however, love this place! I first went last year for an oil change. I was pregnant at the time, and as most women can agree, sometimes we can get nervous going to auto mechanics because right away we go with the mentality that they're going to sell us a lie. 

When I first walked in, I was greeted by Gianni (I believe). It wasn't too packed, so I was in and out of there in less than an hour. The next time, I needed new brakes and rotors. I shopped around at different mechanics this time (just to see who was the most affordable). I went to three other places and  got told my car needed all these other things done. I returned to Reliable and they were just that. More affordable AND honest. 

I returned just recently and they checked out my car. By this time I knew it needed a lot of work done because of my check engine light and the fact that it turned off at almost every stop. My car has been through a lot to say the least. I had just moved back to Vegas from California and just spent $600 in work for my car and the mechanic over in Cali never even fully explained what he fixed, all I know is that when I got back to Nevada, my car was in no better shape. Well, turns out i brought it to Reliable and i was informed that my car had 5 codes and needed a new engine. Instead of trying to make me pay for all the parts and labor, Todd (who is awesome!!) suggested I was better off selling my car for what I could and get a new vehicle since it was going to be a hefty price to fix. I did just that and he even performed a free inspection on my new vehicle. 

Ive never left this place unsatisfied and I would recommend it to anyone looking for good, honest workers."
positive,"Let me start by saying that we would rather a root canal than to set foot into a car dealer for any reason. For about the past 18 months or so I have been Getting recall notices from Ford but of course no one had the parts in stock. This last week I called San Tan Ford and had the pleasure of talking to Eric, my service advisor. He scheduled me for an appointment including a transmission flush. Price wise the flush was about $30 more than I had been quoted elsewhere. The difference was the dealer actually flushed and the others drained and filled. Anyway, back to my story. Eric scheduled my service got me in and out quickly and offered a shuttle.  I got out at a reasonable price with no heavy handed or fear based upsells. When I checked out I was given a list of suggested maintnce items with pricing.  I won't say that walking into the sales side of a car dealer doesn't make me sick anymore but at least I feel like there is a place to get fair pricing and professional treatment."
positive,"The absolute best car repair place I have dealt with. I have a 2004 Crossfire with 60,000 miles and could not find anyone that would work on it because it's a Chrysler with a Mercedes engine..The closest Chrysler dealership that would work on it was in Gastonia and the Mercedes dealership wouldn't even look at it. I bought this car new 13 years ago and have had zero issues with it until recently it had sporadic cranking problems. Last week I was referred to Import Connections. They assured me they could repair the issue and upon my request would look the car over and let me know if they saw any other issues.. The next morning they called me with the report and price.. Per my approval and an amazing price the mechanic replaced the relay box, valve gaskets did rear brakes replaced the transmission plug, changed the oil and put new tires on the rear. my car is like new.. yesterday I had a dash light come on for the traction control but when I drove it over there the light was off. Donald the mechanic took the time to give it a look over and assured me if the issue returned he would handle it!!!! 5 star impeccable service. They are honest and did not take advantage of a women!!! As long as I have an import car I will be using them."
positive,Aone Mobile Mechanic made every step of the process of getting my car repaired so much more smooth and stress free than it would have otherwise been. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they really mean it when they say they provide immediate mechanic services; someone was on their way as soon as I told them my location. Everything from diagnosing the problem to doing repairs was quick and efficient and I was very impressed with the professionalism and honesty from this company. Many others would have seen this as an opportunity to take me for a ride and over charge to get as much out of me as possible but Aone Mobile Mechanic was very straight up and just made sure to get the job done properly the first time around at such an affordable price it was honestly mind blowing. You're not going to find anyone else providing this high quality service at this same affordable price. I was so glad to not have to worry about how much repairs were going to cost thanks to the honesty of this company and professional manner in which they conduct business. I will always go to Aone Mobile Mechanic for all my mechanic needs.
positive,"I have been here twice! One to get my headlight smoked and I must say amazing job and very fast service! Now this time is for a compete transmission swap. Outstanding staff, fast and high quality work. I will differently be coming back and would suggest anyone to take their car there for cosmetic, or mechanical needs.

positive,"It's been a few weeks now, so it is time to post. My daughter wrecked her Jeep Patriot while visiting Vegas back in March. Given a choice, she had the car towed to Ace Brothers. Boy, am I glad she did. They worked over and above to get the insurance matter taken care of and her car came out good as new. Paul, and his entire staff, really knows customer service. Flew into Vegas to pick up the car. Paul picked me up at the airport (on a Sunday morning!), took me to the shop, and patiently explained everything that was done for the car. Went back a few days later to adjust headlights and replace a turn signal light. They took it right in and within 10 minutes or so, I was good to go. My daughter is enjoying her car now thanks to Paul and the experts at Ace Brothers! I cannot recommend them enough! If anyone gets into a car wreck in the Vegas valley and needs their car repaired by honest craftsmen, Ace Brothers is the place! Many thanks!"
positive,"I had my 2000 Toyota Tundra transmission rebuilt here to install myself and they guaranteed their work ! I brought my truck back a month later due to an odd noise after installing the new transmission and they fixed it free of charge. The turn around was great too, my transmission was rebuilt in 4 days and when I dropped my truck off I had it back the next day. Highly recommend! Friendly staff, good pricing and quality work!"
positive,"Absolutely awesome, needed an oil change that was near me, but I also needed front brakes and rear brake repair on top of this my air conditioning was playing up and my transmission was slipping to make things worse I had a check engine light on....:(  I took it to Valley Automotive repair and they inspected everything, adjusted my brakes, recharged my AC and did the oil change, no problem.  The check engine light was because of the transmission but they solved this by replacing my transmission fluid which was black. I highly recommend these guys they are honest and do what it takes to help."
positive,My transmission went out in my Chevy Cruze and I was so upset at how much the dealership wanted to charge me..So I was recommended to TC Auto by my brother in law and it was the best thing I ever did! He had my whole transmission taken out and put back in within 5 days! I will definitely recommend TC Auto to everyone!!
positive,"Just had my car serviced by Deborah Shomsky. She worked to the best of her ability to get our car repaired even when the warranty company gave her and the technician a hard time. Not only that, she kept us updated with changes to the car. We are very satisfied with our experience and definitely will be coming back for further maintenance.

Their technician, Brandon was also very informative on preventative care and further maintenance that we definitely needed to know."
positive,"Great friendly service.
Brought my 2006 f150 into shop to have a slipping transmission fixed.
They called and said it was a misfiring cylinder .
They charged me nothing and diagnosed the problem quickly.
Thanks for being honest and straight forward.
I will return if I have another problem!"
positive,"I have such high standards for service and it's rare to give away 5 stars to anyone in the service industry. I came to Samurai Motors to have them check my car before we drive to Yellowstone on vacation.

I've seen many mechanics, most in the San Francisco Bay Area, but Tsuyoshi-san (call him Yoshi? cool nickname) is the best in my 9 years of US residence. And that's not only because we share our native tongue, Japanese.

When he saw my MINI Cooper, he immediately said I was lucky to have the base model, as he recently saw multiple incidents that transmission went wrong with the S models of the same production generation, which costs like $8k. I thought his expertise was Japanese cars but apparently not!

It was within five minutes that he jacked up the car and spotted completely worn out brake pad and minor coolant leaks, and showed those problems to me. Phew! I mentioned that I was told to fix the suspension by the dealer, which I declined for a second opinion, but Yoshi bluntly said it's not necessary. His skill, confidence and honesty are all amazing.

While repairing, he discovered the thermo housing was also worn out and had to be replaced. Saying, ""I don't know why the manufacturer use plastic material for this part."" and only charged additional $25 for that. Also showed the old housing to me pointing where it went wrong.

After that, I even asked a dumb question - I had been feeling the gearshift was not smooth, and wanted to learn if it was normal. Right away, He drove around the block and said it was ""normal pattern (can't translate exactly - ""driving taste"" if literally) observed for BMW production."" There's nothing he can't answer!

Brake pad: 87.36
Brake roter: 78.85 * 2 = 157.70
Labor: 85 * 1.6 = 136

Thermostat: 46.44
Antifreeze&Coolant: 25.45
Labor: 85 * 1.6 = 136

Total: $614.62

Now I feel secure about the upcoming 1500 miles road trip. :)"
positive,I went to Affordable Muffler because my dad recommended it.  Man was he right on the money!  He told me they did great quality work for a reasonable price.  Their shop is in Cleveland on Lorain road and IT WAS WORTH THE DRIVE FROM PAINESVILLE!  I got there about 15 minutes before they opened on a Saturday.  I ended up being 2nd in line when they opened up.  They repaired a pipe leading to my muffler in a little less than an hour.  They didn't try to oversell to get me to purchase more than what I needed to fix the problem.  I'll be back when my other car needs work too!
positive,"I've been dealing with unwanted/excess noise from my muffler/exhaust. After worrying about getting a ticket for the noise, I took it to Affordable Muffler. I thought I might have to drop it off and come back later. That was not the case. It took them less than an hour to get me in and out. My car is quiet again. And they have a warranty on their parts. Very friendly. They also have estimates from places like Midas/other muffler repair shops on their wall. They charge 1/2 of what these chain muffler repair places will quote you."
positive,"these guys did an awesome job, got my transmission rebuilt in one day, and was very inexpensive. They would of delivered it to my house , if I would of wanted them to, for no charge. Very honest shop."
positive,I stopped in to this business because of all the good reviews on Zillow. They knocked my socks of with the way you get treated here. My HHR was giving me problems and they said they would take a look at it and see what it needed. They told me they could fix it but they informed me about a muffler shop that could do the repair for much less money without having to buy all the new parts I would need if they did the job. They were more interested in customer service than the money they could extract from my wallet. This was one of the best repair shops I have talked with since I moved from a small town in Iowa 29 years ago. With service like this I will use them next time I need them with all the trust in the world.I do not think they would take advantage of anyone from what I experienced! I would send my wife in hear for service and feel very comfortable with what ever they recommended her to do for service.My hat goes off to your shop. You guys ROCK!!!!!
positive,"One night my car was vandalized and try cut my transmission line. Was trying to get it to an auto shop and it died on the way there. Was able to get it into the pep boys parking lot. I went in to see if they could help. 

Initially they said they wouldn't be able to help us because they don't do tranny work. I said ok and started to walk out the door crying because I didn't know what I was going to do now. 

The service manager Jay came out and talked to my boyfriend and I. He said he would take a look. He jacked our car up and got under it in his dress pants and button up shirt without a complaint! He looked around for awhile and confirmed the line had been cut by a razor blade. 

We purchased all the necessary parts from their store to fix the tubing. He got back under and fixed it completely and our car was back to running like nothing happened! He was a life saver and he didn't even charge us for his time (2hrs) just for what we needed to buy a far as fluid and parts. 

We will definitely be returning due to the great customer service and friendliness of Jay!"
positive,"I live in California, daughter goes to school at GCU. Her car has a major water leak and check engine light on!  We email Carter Saturday night, he responds promptly on Sunday morning/ Long story short; he & Chad have her car up and running by Tuesday. Very responsive and kept me in the loop throughout.  Although I hope to never have to use them again, I highly recommend them to anyone in the Phoenix area. Responsive, professional and reasonable. Thank you gentlemen."
positive,"We took our car in on the 14th to get an oil change and the guys here suggested a transmission flush and that there was a leak that needed to be fixed. They gave us a quote and I made an appointment for Monday at noon. I got there and asked to be given the quote again and to know that's what the total would be when the car was done. He printed it out and had me sign it.

 A few hours later my car was done and they showed me what they had fixed and took me back to the front to pay. It was the same amount I had been quoted even though it took longer. Amr is the nicest guy and I will be happy to come back here! I called several other car shops to see if they could quote me a lower price for what I needed done and none of them could come close. Thanks Meineke!"
positive,"I went there to test drive a Dodge Dart and not necessarily to buy it. I have a very strong dislike for pushy sales reps. James who served us was not one of those. I testdrove the car and got it soon after. Service-wise my visit and experience was pleasant (compared to all my other dealership visits, pushy salesmen and even rude staff).

Only reasons not for 5 stars is the inventory had VERY FEW manual transmission cars (I ended up getting automatic) and I also didn't exactly get the financing rate I wanted."
positive,"I am a military guy that had a muffler bracket break on my truck and these guys took care of me very very quick. The price was way more than reasonable and the two gentlemen that were working were very very fair, Competent and even improved what was done the first time by someone else. I suggest them for your muffler work very small business but do it next job and have a very nice shop"
positive,"Driving to Utah fro California my check engine light turned in.  I called Auto Nation Toyota and spoke with Lynette.  She checked with service advisor Mark Guilfoile to see if I could continue to drive my car until I reached Vegas.  As soon as I made it to town, i went straight to them.  They checked the error code and got me back on the road quickly.  Thank you so much for helping us.  Your professionalism and kindness will be remembered always.  Great job!!!!"
positive,"Sorry, guys, I have to knock you down 1 star for your service department. I brought my new car in for some odd stereo issues (randomly un-pairing my phone and resetting itself when I try to browse my iPod) and a vibration in the transmission in 4th gear, which other Cruze owners have noted. The SA flatly dismissed the stereo problems and said the trans problem was me lugging the engine. Yeah, no. But thanks for treating me like an idiot."
positive,"These guys are grade A!!!  They're appointment only so give 'em a call and set one up for quicker service.  I went in today to get an oil change and they were ready right on time.  Their mechanic was friendly and let me come into the bay and check out my vehicle while it was on the lift.  These guys are thorough, clean, polite, and accommodating.  I highly recommend them and will definitely be coming back to let Christian Brothers take care of all my vehicle's needs.  They do it all, too, save rebuilding engines and/or transmissions.  You can call 'em or make an appointment online.  These guys are GOOD!  Glad I found them for my 2007 Nissan Frontier.  Thanks a lot, Christian Brothers!  ~One happy customer"
positive,Got my transmission fluid changed for maintenance. Andrew was very professional and friendly and gave me a great price. I will definitely return for any auto needs.
positive,"I came in today to get my airbag deployers replace due to a manufactures defect and they did a free inspection. Their findings were pretty on point based on what I've been told by other repair shops and their prices were actually, in some cases, more reasonable than other places I normally go to get my car repaired. They were really nice and polite and the service guys seem pretty honest.
I really like the fact that because I'm going to have to get a long service done this week they're willing to work with me to give me a loaner car so I don't have to waste half of my day sitting in their lounge. 
Additionally, they got me in right away for my airbag deployer replacement and I had a pretty hassle free visit today.
Another awesome perk that I just learned, that when I checked in on yelp, they offered me a free oil change with the higher grade synthetic oil, because my car is older and also high mileage. I am not quite sure why they have such a low rating, but my experience today was really great and I will be returning to have my car serviced here."
positive,Danny's transmission has been taking care of my truck for the last two years and I'm glad to say I've finally found a shop I can trust! Always honest with what I need and great on the pricing! I had my transmission rebuilt by them 2 years ago and she is still running like a champ. Highly recommended and will continue to bring my vehicles to them!
positive,"I think I gave Will a shoutout before but this place is such a blessing.
My check engine light went on before a trip to AZ and Will took the time to check things out and reassure me.  He has fixed my radiator, bushings and brakes at prices significantly lower than any others and I have complete confidence in the work they do."
positive,"So glad we found this place!  We've gone to many (too many) mechanics & transmission places in the past.  Finally a place that does good work at reasonable prices with fast & friendly service.  They use common sense with their work & common courtesy when explaining it! They also have a good referral network for issues they don't handle.  Thanks Good Care, we are satisfied customers!"
positive,"Going to the mechanic is one of my least favorite things in life, but my experience with this locally-owned establishment was suprisingly great. I took it in and just dropped the car off. The job took two days, and Jeff  (the owner) called me atleast twice a day for updates. 

Best of all, his team did an amazing job at pretty much replacing and fixing some worn-out parts on my car: timing belt, transmission fluid, water pump, etc. They even had someone wipe down/shine the exterior and the interior. I could hardly recognize my old Lexus! It looked brand-spanking new and reflected the quality of work they put in it. Price was definitely reasonable for the amount and quality of work that was done. 

Jeff and his team also took the time to explain to me the repairs and changes they did as well as show me the old parts they took from my car. They are true craftsmen at what they do and definitely make an effort to build lasting relationships with their customers. I look forward to doing more business with them in the future."
positive,My daughter went to Las Vegas for a wedding party and her car's check engine light came on. She wasn't sure where to go but she got lucky with 1st Response. They spent considerable time on the phone with me explaining the issue and a good amount of time diagnosing and making minor repairs on the vehicle. She is halfway home (to Los Angeles) and so far the check engine light has not returned and the car is still moving forward without any issues. I will follow up in Southern California with my mechanic but kudo's to 1st Response for going above and beyond. All for no charge!!!!!!!!!!! I'm still in shock by that.
positive,"I am unsure what the only other review is about... I took my 2000 Nissan Maxima in upon the recommendation of the man I purchased the car from. I told Victor right away that it ran VERY loud and most likely needed a new front cat and muffler--as I was told when I got an estimate from my usual place; they quoted me 1500 bux! I took it to Mex Muffler today, and they fixed all three of the major problems for well under 300 bux. I expected to pay twice that!  They also let me into the shop so I could see for  myself what the underside of my car looked like (horrific). They then showed me what they could fix and how much it would be. I went across the street to Barriques to wait... about 2 hours later, Victor called my cell to say they were done. Holy wow, my car runs so, so much better.  Actually, the muffler is fine and the front cat is fine. The other shop lied to me. Imagine that, a shop lying in an attempt to garner more money. Oy vey. The kicker? I get a 1 year warranty on the work, and Victor asked me to call him in a week or so to make sure all is well. Why is it so cheap? They bend their own exhaust pipe in-house. Then, they pass the savings on to you. Yep.

These guys are angels. I could not recommend them more."
positive,"This place is the best if you need any work done on your car what so ever! I was in a fender bender which caused for the back right passenger door to need a ton of fixing. After going to a different body shop first who gave me a quote of 3 times as much as it should be Crystal was very kind and helpful and gave me an honest and fair quote (which was much more reasonable). 

She was so kind the entire time and constantly called me giving me updates and even when she was not there she had her Dad (who owns the shop) call me personally to give me updates. They also gave me a lifetime warranty on the repairs and it look like new!

After a day of having my car repaired I noticed that the window would not go down. I brought it back to the shop and they made sure it was fixed right away.

These guys are great and I am never going anywhere else for repairs in the Phoenix area again. I HIGHLY recommend :)"
positive,"This place does top-notch, honest work. I have been recommending it to everyone I know, and I will definitely never take my car anywhere else in Pittsburgh. 

I took in my Toyota Corolla because I was experiencing what I feared was a transmission issue, and I also asked them to check my brakes while they were at it. They asked if they could keep my car for a second day because they were unable to replicate the problem at first. On the second day, they called me back and told me that they'd identified the issue, and that it was relatively minor and wouldn't need to be fixed unless it bothered me! They also checked out my brakes and found out that my rotors were warped, but that was also an issue that could wait until I was replacing my brakes. I came in very pleased with the work they'd done and fully prepared to pay a service fee, but they just handed me my keys back and said that they didn't do any work, so they didn't need any payment. They're honest, thorough, and very communicative, and I can't recommend them highly enough!"
positive,"Best shop in town, Garth is as straight up as they come. I bought a 1999 Pontiac Trans am that was pretty abused but the body and interior was straight, I knew the transmission needed to be replaced. Before I bought the car I called Garth at Leading Edge Performance to see if it was a smart buy and how much it would cost for a new transmission he gave me the straight up answer I was looking for so I bought the car. When I brought it to him for the transmission install I explained to him I wanted the car made reliable so I wouldn't have to worry about breaking down on the side of the road and the occasional dig pass at the local track. He gave me a straight up response about the car and replaced some of the issues it had. The work they do at this shop is second to none, they even had my car detailed before I came to pick it up. I've been to the track a couple times and have taken the car on road trips I'm super happy with this shop, their expertise, the quality of work they do. They make you feel like apart of the family."
positive,"After asking a friend of mine of where to go - I took my SUV down to Island Auto for an oil change and a check engine light that was on in my car.  The owner was really nice and honest - he didn't give me the run-around or try to overcharge me.  My car was repaired well, and for a much better price than what the dealership wanted to charge me.  Will be back again!"
positive,"Several weeks ago the ""check engine"" light on my 2006 Impala showed codes for possible transmission problems.  Based on the great Yelp reviews I drove 110 miles to this AAMCO to have it checked out.  Just prior to my arrival the ""check engine"" light went out.  The owner, Scott, had one of his technicians test drive it.  He couldn't find anything wrong.  Scott said there would be no charge, but to bring it back if the light came back on.  
     Last week the light came back on and I took the car to a local Auto Zone to get a print out of the problem, which indicated two potential transmission issues (after which the light went out again).  Last week I returned to AAMCO and gave him the error code printout from Auto Zone.  Scott had a technician inspect various parts of the transmission.  The cause of the periodic ""check engine"" light was narrowed down to several possibilities.  Scott recommended that, since it seemed to be running OK at the moment it would not be cost effective to go further and start fixing things, running up a bill with no guarantee that it would correct the problem.  He gave me some paperwork to take with me spelling out the potential issues.  Scott said that since he couldn't fix anything for me there would be no charge.  The thing is, by having his technician spend the time to diagnose the problem and providing me with the results, I believe he really did help me going forward.  Oh, and not only that. while checking for the original problem the AAMCO technician fixed a sloppy shift lever, which now shifts precisely and perfectly.  Even so, Scott did not charge me even for that service!
     I cannot praise this business highly enough.  Two visits with quick, efficient, honest and competent service - and no charge - both times.  I learned that this AAMCO can service anything on the vehicle except tires.  If I have any vehicle problems in the future, I will definitely bring it here."
positive,"I'm an engineer and I've done my own oil changes on my cars most of my life. But when I'm on the road or traveling for work I don't have the luxury of toting all my tools around. And so I have to find a place that would do an oil change. 

Now you think could be a simple thing to do and it is. It's not a difficult job but it is an important one. Far if you screw up the oil change, your car will significantly suffer if not irreparably damaged itself. Screw ups can happen in many ways such as the oil not being changed, or the oil not being filled back to full capacity, or the wrong oil being put in, or a different plug oil drain plug being put in, or the wrong oil filter being put on.  It comes down to attention to detail to do the job correctly and ethically. 

So when I came to this Valvoline location I had a initial discussion with Dave the assistant manager to ensure that we had it understanding that I wanted just the task done and not any assumptions made on other issues he may find without first consulting me.  I can understand how this might put off some business owners that here's a customer that's being quite upfront about his expectations. But Dave was very understanding and assured me that they were competent station and could do this job and keep me fully informed. 

And I'm happy to report that he did exactly as he promised!  I'm more than satisfied with the work up an oil change and transmission fluid flush. He even identified a burned-out headlight bulb which I had not noticed and offered a very fair charge to replace it. 

It's nice to identify a reliable service station to do these tasks that is so much harder for apartment dwellers to do. I'll be bookmarking this station for future use!

Thank you Dave for making my Saturday a great day!"
positive,"Let me start off by saying when I called Cobblestone to ask about their services I spoke to the manager named Melissa and she was very helpful. I then decided to take my car to get an oil change and a wash at this location. As I pulled up to the Lube line I was greeted right away. I asked for a basic oil change and Devin pulled up the information on my car and told me I needed synthetic oil due to high mileage, as well as a transmission flush which I've never done. He took the time to do research on my car to let me know what I needed to maintain my vehicle. No one has ever done that previously when I've gotten my oil changed anywhere.. I am grateful that he took the time to research my car and give me the knowledge. Not only did the great customer service end there, as I was paying for my services I was greeted by a cashier named Jazmin, she asked me how my day was as she was ringing me up, she was very friendly. I would have to say my experience here has been great from before I visited all the way until the end of my visit. I would definitely recommend this place for your car services. All staff were very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you Cobblestone!!!"
positive,"I was referred to 5 Star by a mechanic we've used for years who is finally retiring. I said ""You can't retire! Who would take care of my cars?"" He said the best shop he would recommend in Concord is 5 Star Transmission. I said that I wasn't sure I needed transmission repair shop but he assured me that they were really good at all manner of car repair and maintenance. 

I have a 2003 Ford Expedition in perfect condition with 214,000 miles on it that developed an engine problem last year. Long story short, the mechanics at 5 Star could have simply repaired the problem and sent me on my way, but in looking more closely to see why it occurred in the first place, they found the root cause that would have resulted in the problem reoccurring again and again. While it cost me a little more money in the short term, it saved me the inconvenience and annoyance of breaking down and being stranded again for the same problem that I would have thought I paid them to fix the first time.

Over this Christmas, I had one more occasion to need their repair services, and once again found them to be fast and accurate at finding and fixing the problem. In both instances, I have found that they really seem motivated to take an interest in their customers as well as just doing good automotive repair. The owner was there both times and took the time to introduce himself and thank me for the opportunity to take care of my vehicle. The last time, even the mechanic that worked on my car thanked me for coming in. 

I see why my old mechanic recommended 5 Star so highly. I wouldn't go anywhere else now. They have me as a loyal customer from now on. I don't usually write reviews of businesses but this business is worth recommending! These are decent people that provide a great service at a competitive price. Spread the word!"
positive,"My wife and I had decided to go to Vegas for my 49th bday. Half way to Vegas my transmission started slipping severely. I was in a panic as I realized that if I let up on the gas pedal the car would lurch and my transmission would slip for about 3 seconds until it reconnected. I was half way into my 4 hour drive and prayed that my car would make it to its destination. It was about midnight when I arrived into Vegas and well over 100 degrees. As I stopped at a red light I realized that my car wouldn't get past first gear. I crept to the hotel at 10 miles an hour worried that I blew my transmission and envisioning paying 2,000 to fix it. I couldn't sleep. At 6:30am Saturday I brought my car to AAMCO.  What a wonderful shop. Family owned and honest. Kyle put my fears to rest as I explained the symptoms. I was in a very real sense stranded in Nevada but he was so calm and sure it was a small thing. 

Fast forward an hour and I was told it would be a few hundred dollars to replace the governor sensor. Amazing. A dishonest place would have smelled blood knowing I had no choice but to accept and fix the problem so I could get home. They didn't take advantage of me I made it home safe and sound to Los Angeles. I highly recommend this shop for ALL your car issues or maintenance. 

Oh, and by the way, don't forget to say hi to the most beautiful chihuahua in the entire galaxy Lily. Seriously."
positive,"I took my car in to this location on Tuesday June 24, 2014. I needed two sensors replaced which they ordered from another location. I bought my lunch because I knew it would be a while so I was there most of the day. They also changed my oil and some other minor item. It was a great experience and the Manager is funny, entertaining and really engaging with everyone. The only reason they do not get a five is they charged for the diagnostic and I just struggle with that. My check engine light was on and they did need to do that but I am unaccustomed to being charged for it. I will return as I am quite happy with the work and that they were able to take care of me. If you need dependable service this is the place to go!"
positive,"Everyone knows that whenever a woman walks into a joint to get her car fixed, she may not get the work she needs, but rather the work they make you THINK you need.
Not so at Affordable Muffler!

I stopped in on a recommendation upon a lot of other recommendations. I hear that so n' so will ONLY take their car here. That people travel from far away to go here. That this is the ONLY place they will allow muffler service.... the list goes on.

I called at 10a and said I needed a look-see...they said cheerfully, ""bring it in!"". When I arrived, I only had to wait maybe 10 minutes before they took my car. After another 10, I got the diagnosis. I sat to wait for the repairs. 

I waited for about an hour. In that time, I saw a few people come and go. I ended up striking up a conversation with a guy next to me. He's got 6 cars and all are serviced here. Everyone that came up to the desk said how happy they are with the service and that they ARE the best. Someone brought in a ""thank you"" pizza for the crew. Person after person complemented the extremely friendly guy at the desk (I'm assuming the owner??). Everyone said that this is the only place they will bring their cars. Wow, I thought... I'm in the right place!

When my car was done, I paid and was on my way. The price was reasonable and I didn't feel ripped off. A rarity in the auto service world if you ask me.

I wouldn't touch a chain muffler place with a ten foot pole. Been there, done that. Affordable Muffler is an independent shop that serves with a smile. I like that."
positive,"Driving from Washington my transmission went out in Blythe California, towed it to Phoenix, where our son lives. He recommended this shop to us. Had the transmission re-built and the radiator replaced at a FAIR AND HONEST price.
A few weeks later I hear this rattle and the RPM's are running high. Drove it back down to Phoenix for them to look at. I honstly thought it had something to do with my transmission but it didn't. They found a cracked hose and a clip on my brake pad that wasn't reattached after Les Schwab done my brakes. This was all fixed for FREE and should of cost me $250, but being the awesome person Mike is, they didn't charge me. I've NEVER had a Mechanics place fix my car for $0.
I have never in my 56yrs had an HONEST auto Mechanic, until now. 

Thank you for your fair and honest work....
THIS PLACE HAS MY BUSINESS FOR LIFE!!!"
positive,"The store manager, Justin, took a quick moment on a busy Saturday to help me remove my under body transmission cover after another local service place failed to tighten it back the day before. Would have been easy to brush me aside but it was a quick fix and Justin did it with a positive attitude!"
positive,"Follow the great Yelp reviews--Yelpers will never steer you wrong! 

Affordable Muffler is where it's at. I don't know much about cars or their mechanics, but I do know that getting my car fixed is usually a horrid, time consuming, bank account murdering experience. Affordable Muffler proved me wrong! 

I stopped in without an appointment in a huge rush--I mean, this place was packed. Regardless of all the people, I walked right up to the counter and this is what happened:
 
""Hi!"" 
""Hello--what kind of car is it?"" 
""Oh... umm, a silver Corolla."" 
""Great. What's your phone number?
(I gave him my number) 
""I'll take your keys and give you a call"" 
""Cool! Thanks!"" 

Then I walked out not knowing when I'd hear from them, or when I'd get my car back. No explanations of what was wrong with my car was needed. Even with what looked like 25 people ahead of me, they called me within an hour or two with a diagnosis and a price. Plus, it was a price that was about $200 under what I thought it was going to be. 

About 2-3 hours later I received another call that my car was ready to be picked up, so I headed out and grabbed it. This all. I dropped off my car, had it diagnosed, fixed, paid for and home in less than 5-6 hours. Seriously. 

The staff is also much more talkative when you catch them without a ton of people in the waiting room, which is really nice. I love to hear about car stuff--mostly because I doubt I'll ever fully understand, but it's nice to feel like you know how some parts work. 

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend another place in Cleveland to get your exhaust, muffler or ""Check Engine"" light looked at. It's cheap, fast and awesome. Besides, you know a place is trustworthy and good when it's recommended to you by another auto repair shop--especially one that admits it would be much cheaper to go to Affordable Muffler."
positive,"Best car shop ever. Fair, honest, great service. Great attention to detail. They will save you money if they find ways to. I live in Chandler and drive over 45 min to Michael's Collision because of their high quality service.

Work done: They cut the 1/4 back part of my car and replaced it with a new one, including new bumper. 
Replaced trunk struts.

I was rear-ended on the high-way and one of my friends referred me to Michael's Collision. Michael and his team were very courteous and did their best to help me. They even referred me to a great lawyer and wrote me a check for over $100 because the muffler they ended up replacing was cheaper than what the insurance company quoted (they could've kept that money!). The work they did was impeccable, my car looked better than when I first bought it. To save me more money, they gave me one of their own cars as rental. 
I went back to them after a second, milder rear-ending accident a few months later, and they did the same amazing job.

Almost two years later, I contacted them because I had trouble opening my trunk and since they had cut the quarter back part of my car and put a new piece in after the accidents, I thought it was related to that work. Michael remembered me and asked me to bring my car over, where they would look at it and perform any work at no cost. And sure enough, they did! The problem was the weakening of the trunk struts, which they replaced, but I don't think it was even their fault from prior work. All I had to pay was $35 for the new parts, which was way cheaper than any auto parts store would have charged. They even fixed my trunk handle and saved me $170. This is a great car shop and I recommend it to anyone.

They offer excellent warranty for their work!"
positive,"Scot is the best and kindest person in Las Vegas. I had a transmission issue. I went to 4 different shops that quoted me $5,000 then $3500. They didn't even open up the car, just drove it. Scott quoted me $2500. Then he took the time to open up the WHOLE car at no cost and found an electrical issue at $300. Saved me $2000!! Then when the issue came back he fixed it at no cost! These are the most thorough and HONEST mechanics I've been to and I just moved here from North Carolina."
positive,Great place to go to check your car out for exhaust or muffler problems extremely affordable and also the people working inside know exactly what they are doing !
positive,"These guys were great! Took my car to TJ Honda dealership for an oil change a couple months ago and they came back saying I needed new rear shocks and a full transmission flush. Being skeptical of their recommendations, I drove my car from Florida to Vegas. When I arrived I brought my civic to island automotive. The mechanic came out to my car and checked the shocks and the transmission fluid on the spot. He advised me that the shocks were barely leaking and that the transmission fluid still looked ""healthy"". I got an oil change which was fairly priced. Overall a great experience. Honest and fair!"
positive,"Took my Chevy cavalier there for a check engine light and a light I wasn't too sure of what it meant.  Those two things are pretty much asking to be taken advantage of, but they didn't.  They were very respectful and it was finished with in a couple of hours of dropping it off.  I will be using them for everything incoming my car now, they have earned my trust and as paranoid as I can be at times that can be difficult."
positive,I'm impressed!  Daughter from CA had a tranny breakdown.  Found this dealer and met service writer Tyler.  He did exactly what he promised and got her on the road home...with a new transmission...in 24 hours.  And the best news is he checked for a warranty and there was no charge.  She thought her warranty was expired.  Thanks Tyler!  I'm impressed!
positive,This has got to be the most friendly efficient and stressless environment to ever have your car repaired. I pulled in without an appointment and was immediately greeted by the staff. They took the car in to evaluate an air conditioning problem. I had a previous shop quote me $450 to fix the issue. within 10 minutes they diagnosed the problem and it was less than a 20 dollar repair.  They did the repair and I was out the door. I highly recommend them for all of your car service needs. I've been a loyal customer for 10 years and have never had a bad experience
positive,"The owner, Will is one of the most professional mechanics I have had work on my car.

You wouldn't see this place from the street, it is tucked in behind five other repair shops which are not as good as this one.

I had some issues with my lexus coupe.  I have friends that are mechanics who fix things for me, but really complicated stuff like on this car in the computer system need someone good.

Will trouble shot this car for several days to find out what the problems were, which was great because nothing tripped the onboard computer, to throw a code as to what was wrong.

Ended up being a couple transmission solenoids, and an engine coolant sensor.

Another shop would have probably not been able to figure out the problem, or just started replacing unnecessary parts.

He gave me a call at every step to let me know what was going on also.

It helps that he likes tuner cars"
positive,"Hands down the most honest auto shop I have ever encountered. Let me start with the fact they saved me literally at least a couple thousand dollars. 

They did a (free) diagnostic on my vehicle and told me they think it could be a transmission problem and that if I go to a Nissan Dealership to get this fixed, it may be covered under the extended warranty. Sure enough, I go to a Nissan dealership and it is totally covered. New trannys cost at least 2 thousand dollars, and because of their honesty and moral, I didn't spend a dime.

Not only that, but the manager (maybe owner?) Keith told me I could call him at any time if I have questions about what the Nissan auto shop relayed to me. 

I have finally found an auto repair shop I trust and will be a loyal customer to."
positive,"I'm pretty sure this review is the best way to thank Jeff, Mike and the whole crew at Professional Brake Service. They put the ""family"" in family owned business, and I felt like family from the moment I spoke with Jeff on the phone. 
My car had recently failed an emissions test and I needed to have it fixed so I could register it. My first thought was ""this is going to cost a bundle of time and money by bringing it to Honda West, who incidentally had just serviced my car 2 weeks earlier."" Then the idea popped into my head to Yelp Honda West and see what others were saying about them and their competition. What a revealing decision that turned out to be as Honda West has a 2.5 star Yelp rating and many of the poor reviews reflected my own experience. 
When I searched the competition I came across Professional Brake Service with a sterling 5 star Yelp record and phrases like Honesty, Integrity, Stellar Service, etc. in the various reviews: Phrases i might add that are not indicative of most auto repair companies including my dealership, Honda West. However, the reviews don't begin to do Professional Brake Service justice. I spoke with Michael in the lot and advised him of the issues I was having and in no time he had the car on the scope checking the sensors while I took a seat inside and spoke to Jeff briefly. Michael came in within 5 minutes and invited me into the garage to view the scope results that read that everything was functioning normally. He told me that by driving my vehicle I must have reset the sensors and since the check engine light was off it would be a great time to go get a smog test. But before I left, I told Jeff about two other issues dealing with my brakes and Michael showed me what the problems were and fixed them in less than 10 minutes. Most surprising was the fact that there was no charge! It would have set me back $250 at Honda West for them to scope my car and do the little fixit stuff Michael did for free and it would have taken them all day to do it. 
My car passed the smog test and is again registered thanks to Jeff and Michael. I am due for a 120,000 mile service and I am definitely having it done at Professional Brake Service, in fact I am bringing my car here for all my future automotive needs. You guys ROCK!!!"
positive,"I happened to notice that my car was due for service, ok it was overdue for service. I happened to stop by under the impression Ford and Mazda are still affiliated with one another. It didn't matter. The Service dept had no issues performing an oil change and tire rotation. The timeliness was fantastic- I was kept informed each step as it progressed. I was offered an complimentary rinse, well since I have a convertible I was cautious- but I quickly realized I had no reason to be. They treated my car as if it was their own---handled with care. My car is a manual transmission which I know that many don't know how to drive one, well their staff clearly proved that they are fully aware of all types of vehicles and never mistreated my ""baby"". Anyone with sportscars knows that you want a certain type of person to drive and take care of your car the way you want it to be taken care of-- here they know how to handle my cars. I will be back!"
positive,"So I was supposed to take my truck to another place by my office and took a referral from my coworker to bring my truck here. I am so glad I did, after the other place told me I would have to replace my transmission I decided to get a second opinion and I spoke to Pam and she made me feel better she let me know they would do a diagnostic and then keep me informed as to wether or not I would need a replacement but they would trouble shoot from least expensive first. She informed that either Scott or Kyle would give me a call once they knew what I needed to have fixed. Scott called me and it was a hose and a clamp under 200 out the door! All this done in less than 1 hour and I have my truck back on the road! This is the place you should go for an honest repair service."
positive,"Businesses that do it right deserve to be rewarded. Occasionally I'll take the time to write a deservedly scathing review but it's the businesses that thrill me that deserve time and attention. Toyo Motors is awesome.

I moved from Chicago last year. My 2009 Toyota was well maintained and loved but I wanted it serviced after freighting it out and I had noticed some rust on the exhaust and muffler. I found Toyo Motors through other reviewers - I don't feel a need to go to a dealer for service, if I'm lucky enough to find a good service business. Their reviews read like love letters so in I went. After a thorough check by their mechanics, I learned there was more extensive rust (thanks Chicago - my car was even garage kept but all that salt and moisture finds its way). The mechanics told me I didn't need to replace the parts yet- the dry AZ climate would buy me time. But obviously, rust doesn't go away on its own. I opted to restore the under carriage. It is an expensive job, due to the muffler and especially the catalytic converter but their pricing was beyond reasonable and fair and I appreciated their honesty and sense of reserve about what I needed to do. Any business that tells you that you have the option not to spend money on something, is looking out for your bottom line.

Since that initial repair work, they have serviced my Toyota exclusively. Oil changes, battery... whatever my car needs, they will be the only one who works on it. I am always shocked and relieved at how little repairs cost there and they are professional, friendly, prompt and thorough in reviewing your car with you.  They warranty their repairs, even giving you a longer warranty for a new battery than you can hope to get in this hot climate. (If you don't already know, car batteries go faster in the Southwest). They as much announced you can end up getting two batteries for the price of one, when and if you need a new one. They have scheduled me whenever I have requested, never kept me waiting and my car drives better than it ever has. Toyo Motors is the best."
positive,"My check engine light came on, and they helpfully diagnosed the problem for free--another auto shop had left the cap off when they did my oil change! The mechanics at Island were fast (I had to get to the airport), good at what they did, generous, and calm. Big thanks for being good mechanics and great people!"
positive,"When I met Arthur he was a mechanic at Towbin Bentley some years ago be for he had his own shop. I was introduced to Arthur by somebody who was driving a custom Bentley GT at the time. 




I figured if he worked at Towbin Bentley and my boy trusted him he can most definitely work on my Mercedes E55 AMG. 

I remember my very first experience with him checking my check engine light that came on. He hooked up some device to the car erased the code to turn the light off & told me if it comes back on just bring it back to him & he would do a in depth Dionostic and then told me to have a nice day! 

I asked him how much I owed him? He laughed, then told me I don't owe him anything & to go enjoy my ride! I tried to at least give the guy a tip but he refused to take @ least a twenty from me. I mean mercedes would have more than likely charged me a couple hundred bucks and told me it was sum BS fix they've done! 

Guess what....

The light never came back on!!!

That's what got me to really trust how honest this man really is!!! These shops will make up something just to take your money & break something else so u would have to come back later!! 

So what sold me on his skills was when my boy blew out one of his turbos in his Bentley. The cost was upward of I believe 10k -12k if I'm not mistaken!!! But of course Arthur being Arthur worked his magic & got it covered for if I remember correctly around 6k - 8k!!! I know shit that's still a lot of doe right?!? But it's better than 12k was all my boy kept repeating to me!

Well Arthur sent him a picture of his motor taking apart to where there was 3 or four sections of the dismantled motor with screws & all kinds of parts layered out!!! 

When my boy showed me the picture of his motor ripped apart I was the one freaking out & asked him... You are not scared?!? 

He was like naw he will get it done. Sure enough Arthur had him up and running ASAP like it wasn't nothing!!! 

That's when I was sold and I will not take any vehicle to anyone other than to him!!!!!!

I took my E55 AMG back to Arthur for different things over the years I had the car. I got to know how honest and genuine he real is and got to know him to the point where I call him a brother!!!

Like today (08-15-18) I had to stop by his shop just to check on him because I haven't seen him in for ever because I don't have any car issues to bring to him! I figured I might not have any car problems for who knows how long so I went to his shop just to say hi & check on him!!!

That's the relationship I've built with him over the years of him helping me with all my cars as well as my 2015 BMW S1000 RR motorcycle. 

Over the years he has saved me tons of money by me not having to take my mercedes to the dealership! They were gonna charge me $500 for my passenger seatbelt getting stuck and would not retract. They told me $500 without even taking the time to look at what was wrong! They said nope it's $500 to replace it! 

I asked Arthur just to take a look at it when I was getting something else fixed. When I picked up the car the problem I took it there for was fixed and he gave me the bill. I asked him, what about the seatbelt? Did u take a look at it? 

He replied yes it was getting caught and I just unwind it all the way and it lined itself back up and retracted on its own. He then said If i have a problem with it just bring it back. Then he told me he took my dash apart & ran an AUXILIARY cord threw it so I can hook up my iPhone. 

I then asked how much do i owe for that?!? He said you didn't ask me to do that so don't worry about it!  I started to feel like I'm gonna put this guy out of business if he keeps this madness up!!!!! But I never had a problem with my seatbelt or my music again!!

I can go on & on about extras he has done to my rides and then refuse to charge me more than what we originally spoke about for what I dropped the vehicle off for!!!

Arthur has proven over and over again that he is not just a reliable hard working mechanic.

He is honest and always is willing to go above & beyond to help anyone who comes to him!!!

He is an ABSOLUTELY AWESOME PERSON that is rare to find!!!

So sorry for the essay!!!If I could give him 10 stars I would!!!"
positive,"I came here after having gone to three car washes, a detailing place and two muffler shops. I had a very suspicious odor coming from under my car: dead animal.maybe. these two young men who work here went out of their way to help me. I mean they figured out a way even.with out a water pressure thingy. I would travel all the way over here again just for the awesome customer service!!! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!"
positive,Welp yelpers i am back again i can only say that my van had to be fixed again because i went elsewhere before i knew of this secret tucked away aamco shop off valley view.surely this fix to my van was heavy but i can tell already that the work was solid but while i was here other shops were bringing  in transmissions to be fixed by them while other places up charged their clients.Scott pam an Kyles team rules.  Guy
positive,"Danny's came highly recommended by a friend, and I can understand why.  I was in a horrible position of having been given a quote for nearly $3,000 for a transmission rebuild, and I luckily called Danny who picked up my vehicle promptly by tow truck and proceeded to repair my transmission in only 1.5 days for about $800 less than I was quoted at the other facility.  I was also provided a 2 year warranty by Danny's which gives me great peace of mind since a transmission rebuild is such a substantial repair.  My only regret is not going with Danny's in the first place!  Service was prompt, convenient, and honest - I would recommend Danny's to anyone."
positive,"Spencer Kaplan (who I love working with)is my normal service provider, while he was on vacation Josh Singer took care of my service this visit! As always the great personalities and professionalism of the service team made for another easy transaction at Mercedes. Although I had a few hiccups with an insurance adjuster, Josh got my car repaired. Thanks Josh! Cheryl in the loaner department is funny and a pleasure to work with as well. Rex in sales, is knowledgeable and so patient. He makes me want to get a new Mercedes sooner rather than later! It's great working with everyone at this location!"
positive,"So, I'm not a yelper but because my transmission was giving me problems and I didn't really trust the guys who put it in the first time, decided to use the yelp reviews to find me a mechanic that wouldn't rip me off.  Safe to say, way less money than i was planning to spend and what seemed like honest to goodnesss, honesty, from a mechanic shop.  Basically, it wasn't the transmission but a part connected to it that was the heartburn.  I still have all my gears and money to get more work done.  So, if you have transmission problems, at least here you know they'll fix what's broke, not what pays them the most."
positive,"Excellent price, very good work.  I had them replace the muffler and tailpipe on my '71 Jeep.  It wasn't more than 15 min. after I arrived and the Jeep was on their lift and Victor was giving me my options.  They guys know their way around vehicles.  Rest assured that the job will be done well at a great place.  Would go back in a heart-beat.

Follow up - I stopped by yesterday and had a random motorcycle part that needed some welding.  Victor had it done in less than 10 min. and only charged me $20.  Honestly,  I freaking love this shop."
positive,"Ray has the BEST, HONEST PLACE AROUND. Seriously this guy bends over backwards. I have never been ripped off and they even ran the check engine light test for me, for free on numerous vehicles for work and private. 
One of my cars failed emissions. I was so upset, the guy at the place said it was the rim around the gas tank. I brought it over to Ray, (he wasn't there so Derek helped out, who is his right hand guy & also great) he ran the test and said its just a new gas cap, thats it. He said if I have to order that it will cost you a few more bucks, just go up to the Auto Store. It cost me $10 and went back and passed. Thank god I didnt bring it to some place and they screwed me replacing the whole rim or gas tank. LOVE LOVE LOVE them. I will never go elsewhere. 
I found Ray, because he was close to my work and I was bringing all my work cars there. After I found out how cool he is, we bring our family cars there now too. I have probably brought about 7 different cars there since 2009 and NEVER had a problem.

He also works on higher end cars. The whole crew there is awesome! 

Thank you! 

Cons-- (for company) He is behind the new, giant, discount tire so its hard for off the beat people to see him."
positive,"I've been bringing vehicles to these guys for a couple years now. They were always amazing when it came to regular maintenance (oil change, etc.) on a 08 Chevy I once had, but the real test came when I brought in my boyfriend's 2000 Honda Civic. The check engine light was on and we were both worried that it was something serious. I'm always the one in charge of bringing cars into shops because I'm home during the day, and after a couple of bad instances with other auto shops (they took advantage of me ) I told my boyfriend I would see what Kelly Clark would do for me. And, like I knew they would, they treated me with the utmost respect and walked me through every part of what they did, from explaining the initial steps they needed to take to find the problem, to calling and describing the issue, to recapping everything with me when I came back to pay and take back the car. I really appreciate how great these guys are, and I always feel like when I walk in, they aren't going to take advantage of me just because I'm a young woman who doesn't know very much about cars. They are a bit pricey, but I plan to continue to do business with them because of their customer service attitude!"
positive,The employees at Panda Auto are super friendly. I brought my car in today to see why my check engine light was on and to get an oil change. They were quick and priced VERY fairly. I've never been to a repair shop on my own before so I was terrified of walking away feeling cheated but that was not the case at all. They also seem to attract equally friendly customers. A sweet woman waiting gave my daughter a music box. Mike was sweet and understanding of my toddler and anyone who treats my daughter well leaves a lasting impression on me. I'm set on having a long term relationship with Panda Auto. Thanks guys!
positive,"The staff here is great! My check engine light kept coming on and I was getting the run around from 3 other competitors. I came here and immediately the Manager Tomas was very helpful and he was able to tell me the problem right away. Gas cap wasn't on tight enough so it triggered the light to come on. He told me to drive my car for 50 miles to reset then bring it back for the smog test. It worked. I greatly appreciated his advice and service because I was so frustrated when I left other places such as Midas and Terrible. They wanted to charge me 150 just for a smoke test plus repairs if they found something wrong. Not only did Purrfect fix the problem but they are reasonably priced too. 9.99 for a smog test and 19.99 for an oil change. Not like other places. Everyone I came across here from the Manager, front desk, and staff were friendly, cool, and helpful. I will come again for future services. Thank you!"
positive,"In Vegas for what was supposed to be a break from a bigger trip from Seattle to Tampa, FL.  Wife broke her ankle on the Strip and got stuck here for 6 weeks.  On the way here car broke down and needed a new torque converter in Ely, NV.  So when car started clunking every time it started moving after a stop I figured, the way my luck was running, that I now had a new major problem.  I just knew the transmission was going to be needing a major repair.  Thinking $$$$.  Found Steve O's on Yelp and brought it in.  15 minutes later he told me he had good news and bad news.  I cringed waiting for the news.  The good news was he found the problem.  Bad news was he wasn't going to make any money from me.  Turned out to be a loose motor mount.  About time my luck changed.  Of course it helps big time that I found an honest shop not looking to rip me off.  Will take car back there before we continue our trip for an oil change and check over.  Highly recommend this shop."
positive,"I'm not the biggest fan of Jiffy Lube. I've been burned many times and I've sworn off of them since the last experience I had in a Utah Jiffy Lube.  But this LV Jiffy Lube changed my life. 

I drove to Vegas from Utah (5 hours) and noticed my transmission was slipping a bit.  I figured it was my transmission fluid, and was already cursing at Jiffy Lube in Utah for neglecting to check it/top it off at my last oil change service a month ago.  I was going to take it to a VW dealership to have it looked at, but after a call from my dad, he reminded me that Jiffy Lube does free top-off service if you're a customer.  So, my friend and I drove our way down to this Jiffy Lube just a few miles away from our hotel.

The store manager and another employee helped me and were the kindest and nicest employees I have ever encountered at any service stop.  The store manager pulled my car into the bay (with my friend and I in it), checked my trans fluid, and even sang us a song.  He came back up after about ten minutes of tinkering underneath and told me it was the trans fluid, I had a leak, and it needed a service that he couldn't perform at Jiffy Lube.  He topped off the trans fluid, free of charge, and gave me advice on what to do on our drive home.  He suggested I take it to my personal mechanic home and get it fixed, but that this would be a quick fix until then.

I am super impressed and grateful for the service that the employees at this store. I did not feel like they were trying to cheat me out of anything or try to up-sell anything.  They were honestly trying to make sure I got home safely and without much car trouble.  

If it was feasible, I would drive the 5 hours to Las Vegas to get oil changes from this store and these employees because I have never felt more comfortable and in good hands then I have at this location."
positive,"Was traveling on the PA turnpike and had the check engine light come on! As a repeat costumer to the Bridgestone/ Firestone business in our home town, we were delighted to have the same friendly service and upfront cost analysis while out of town. Very friendly customer service! Let me tell you, we are 2 women traveling and at best have a rudimentary knowledge of car service and for some it can be an intimidating to go to a new shop and get a service engine light checked because of fear of being ripped off!! NOT THE CASE!! Excellent service! If I lived in the area I would go again! Thank you to the team that services, David at the frond desk, Clay the one who changed the oil and the others that I didn't get their names!!"
positive,"A family friend recommended this place a few months back when I became dissatisfied with my last mechanic. First time I came because my check engine light had come on... so I was expecting the worst. They checked it out and it was just my gas cap that had become loose! They didn't charge me for looking at it, just told me to go buy one at an auto parts store. I've had a few oil changes since then and they've been great, great price too. Scott and Kyle have AMAZING customer service and make you feel like your car is in the hands of honest, trained professionals. This past week my emergency brake light has been coming on whenever I brake as well as my right blinker blinking twice as fast. Took it in and they replaced the blinker bulb and topped off my braker fluid. NO CHARGE! Probably a no brainer fix to some, but as a single girl who doesn't always get to talk to my dad about these things... I need these mechanics in my life! This place really cares about maintaining that loyal customer basis and not charging you for silly fixes. Best mechanics in Vegas. I live in South Las Vegas and I will make the trip just for these guys. Will have to get my brakes replaced in another 10,000 miles or so and I won't be taking it anywhere else!!"
positive,I just had service on my car. They quote great prices. I had a check engine light and they looked at it for free. It turned out to be a gas cap. They also replaced a leaking fuel line. The price was exactly as quoted. I will take all my vehicles here. The customer service is great.! The owners are friendly and know their stuff.
positive,"I came here because my transmission wasnt shifting properly, these guys did a great job at diagnsing and repairing my problem for a lot less than I expected and even gave me the 10% discount from their weboage. They even went the extra mile to make sure fluids and fiters were all replaced.
Definitely recommend them for all my auto repair, especially transmission work."
positive,"I'm typically not one to write reviews on Yelp. However, I couldn't let my experience go unnoticed. I've had several problems with my car (purchased through CarMax).  I took my Nissan Rogue to Planet Nissan to have them replace my transmission in August 2016. The experience wasn't the greatest. There was a serious communication problem between the service technician, myself, and the warranty company. However, the problem was resolved and I rolled out of the door a satisfied customer. Come November 2016, I found myself back at Planet Nissan with a new problem. Mike, the service technician was PHENOMENAL. He quickly pulled up all my information and had my vehicle inspected the same day. I was put in a rental car the next day - no questions asked. He updated me anytime something was fixed or was in the process of getting fixed. He even took care of my concerns on his days off! He has some of the absolute BEST customer service skills I've experienced. Today I picked my car up from Nissan and it runs like new. I will never go to another mechanic shop as long as I live in Vegas - and as long as Mike is there."
positive,"Yes, I am afraid I'm going to have to chime in with everybody else here... believe it or not, folks, there is indeed an honest brake shop in Las Vegas.

After driving around in the heat, I stopped at the store and heard this horrible creaking noise from my brake pedal and suddenly it felt mushy like never before. Needless to say, brake failure is a scary thing, so the next morning I dropped my ride off at Professional Brake Service to have 'em check it out.

Mary, who remembered my name from my earlier phone call (nice touch), called my about an hour later and actually apologized because there was nothing they could sell me. My brakes were at 90% and she said they couldn't duplicate the problem and the car stopped on a dime. She mentioned that some cars acted this way occasionally in this heat.

Not only wouldn't they rip me off, they also corrected my tire placement that the last shop I visited screwed up (high end wheels that have to be on a specific side of the car). They even reset my check engine light!

Let me tell you, there is no better feeling than to walk out of a garage not feeling like you've been **you know what**. 

Give these people your business!"
positive,Went in today to see why my sons check engine light keeps coming on in his car. Let's be honest if I waited for him to do it the engine would probably have blown up. Seriously though the man working was so nice and helped me right away. Good news is it seems just to be a dirty air filter. The store was very clean and organized. Usually I hate going in places like this because I feel out of my element. Again great service.
positive,"I was recommended to these guys and it's paid off in spades.  They're the only honest car mechanic I've been to in Vegas.  No nonsense, good people.  A few examples:

I needed a window motor.  They quoted me a price on the part and labor.  I thought I could find the part cheaper by going after-market on Ebay.  Asked them if I could supply the part.  They said sure, no problem.  Bring in the part and we'll just charge the labor.  

Thought my transmission was acting up.  Brought it in to them.  They gave it a spin and said ""Seems OK to us.""  Any other garage would have trumped up the problem to fleece the customer.  Sure enough, it's been riding smooth since.

Was having trouble with my AC.  Midas wanted $1500 for a complete replacement of the AC system.  Brought it to Jack and Sons.  They said it was an easy patch and a freon recharge.  $150. It's been blowing cold ever since.

Seriously, these guys are as professional as it gets.  5 stars."
positive,"I have been going here for years since at least early 2000s.  Great work for great prices, labor price is set no hidden charges no mechanic saying well this was wrong too so its another $100.  
I never ever had any issues with any repairs they have done.They do everything except Engine, transmission and Tire but If that is what you need done he knows other near by businesses he will send you to. 
Its not pretty but I don't care,nor does the car,  for the rates and workmanship I will travel the 30 minutes from Tempe to have Eli repair my car. He is honest and willing to go the extra mile he has made trips to my house to check jeep or will travel distances for parts. 
I couldn't recommend them more if I could would give even more stars."
positive,"My transmission light started raging when I was off roading in Pahrump.  I was visiting from Los Angeles and was ready to go home.  Talk about bad timing.  The only reliable place it seemed was in Vegas, and an Aamco to boot.  I drove all the way into LV, sweating the whole time wondering how long was I going to have to stay now, $$$$, etc.  I pulled in to the Aamco and walked into the office and it looked like Best Buy on Black Friday.  Phones ringing, commotion, an overly busy environment.  ""I'm f@%#ed"" I thought.  

A gentleman asked me behind the counter how he could help me (it's been two months so of course I forgot his name by now - Mike, Scott, Steve, Dan?).  I explained my transmission light was on, etc.  He said they were extremely busy (which was definitely obvious) and could I bring it back tomorrow?  I said ""I wasn't planning on staying the night, I wasn't local, I was visiting from LA...."" and he saw I was hesitant but willing to stay if I had to.  He immediately got up, asked for my keys and said ""Let's go check it out"".  

He popped the hood, started the car and ran a bunch of tests.  He said nothing seemed to be out of line, the computer was reading a fan belt or timing belt problem (or something like that) but there was nothing wrong with that either.  He said he thought my car was just hot and turned off the transmission light.  I asked ""are you sure?"" because I had visions of my car exploding on the 15 South on my way back to LA and them finding my charred remains whenever there is something wrong with my car.  He was quite positive.

I offered him some cash which he refused no matter how hard I insisted.  He refused my money although he dropped everything in that s**t storm that was happening in the office just to help someone out.  Places like this don't exist anymore and I was taken aback - I wish I lived in Las Vegas again just so I could have someone reliable to work on my car - great place!!"
positive,"Last month my wife's car was making a loud noise from the muffler so I called Mex Mufflers for a price quote and the guy quoted between $200-$300.  I called other repair shops and they quoted $300-$400.  I took the car in and they inspected it and showed me which part needed work.  They said they can weld the metal pipe to the muffler.  The cost?  $50!  This morning, my wife's car was making a scratching noise from the muffler.  Before I took it in, I examined it and one of rusted bolts holding the metal shield came loose.  It was not Mex Muffler's fault.  I took it in, and explained the problem. The guy quoted $25, and I said go for it.  After the car was fixed, he said, ""no charge"".  I insisted that I compensated him but he said it was an easy fix and he wouldn't take payment.  This place has integrity.  The wife's car now drives fine."
positive,"My husband and I recently financed two vehicles within the 5 month time frame with Auto Nation Toyota. Our sales guy Eugene Lewis was very personable and communicated with us effectively. I bluntly expressed what I was looking for and he went out of his way to search inventory for the specific vehicle I wanted (manual transmission and in a specific color, etc.). Eugene found the vehicle for me. If you're considering your next lease or finance to be a Toyota, go see Eugene. I highly recommend him....."
positive,"A couple of months ago my exhaust pipe rusted off completely I went to get an estimate yesterday at Monona tire and they quoted me 1300 dollars to get my muffler and exhaust pipe fix so my boss recommended mex, well today I went to their Milwaukee st location to see what they could do for me. They're quote was $250. They fixed it in 2 hours and now it runs great! Thanks Mex!!!"
positive,"I really found this place by accident. I needed my three speed transmission from my 1958 Ford Ranchero repaired. I called the place and talked with Don, he assured me he could take care of whatever problems I was having.  Don researched the type transmission I had and order all of the parts. Not everything came from the same place so he had to shop around to get the correct parts. It took about a month before Don was satisfied that he had all of the parts.  Don's technician was very good at what he does in rebuilding old transmissions. I picked up the transmission and put it in my truck the next day. The old Ranchero has never run and shifted as smooth since I've owned it.  I would definitely recommend the shop to anyone looking to repair their old transmission. The old cars are becoming rarer every day and a reliable and honest repair shop even rarer.  Thanks Don and his crew for the excellent job well done."
positive,Quite satisfied. What one place quoted as $665 this place quoted as $350 for a muffler replacement. I am very pleased and will definitely be coming back again.
positive,"First off, I would like to say thank you to Scott and his team at this AAMCO for all they have done. They are experts in their craft, and Scott really cares about not only his family, but his customers and his customer's cars. He is also one of the very few business owners I have met that actually listens to you &genuinely does all he can to help you, and cater to your needs.

After looking through Yelp at all the transmission shops AND calling a few in addition to this AAMCO in order to compare prices, we brought in our 1990 Jeep Grand Wagoneer that we had just purchased, with a broken transmission. Not only could their price not be beat, but their level of customer service and professionalism (even over the phone) also went above and beyond the 2 other shops.

Communication was great from start to finish. When we dropped the truck off, we let him know what we wanted done and asked if he could look at a couple other things for us while he and his team were under the truck. It was a Saturday morning, so he let us know we'd hear from him on Monday. Monday came and first thing in the morning, he let us know what he saw, what he recommended, and then asked what we wanted to do. After deciding what work was to be done, he gave us a 2 day window as to when the work could be done pending anything else they might find. On the first day of the estimated date of completion, mid-morning, he let us know the truck was good to go!

When we picked the car up, he talked over with us what else he saw, what they had done, and the warranty that came with the rebuilt transmission, before we paid. After paying, he told us to stop by in a couple weeks at any time and free of charge, so they could double check the rebuilt transmission for us in case they need to fix anything.

I would highly, highly, highly recommend going to this shop for any of your transmission needs. This shop knows their craft and won't try to sell you services or make you pay for things you don't really need. Also most of the time, I only write reviews when I have an experience that leads me to believe that a business should be well known and trusted, or when a business should be avoided. Having to write a full review for everything in between just isn't worth my time."
positive,I bought a used TT 2003 Audi and it had several problems.  They were so very professional to work with. They replaced my transmission and offered the same guarantee as the dealer would have at a lower cost.  I found them to be honest and I highly recommend them.
positive,"Great big heartfelt broke teacher shout out to Korner Kwik Lube, specifically Blake and Al! They repaired my overheating issue and took it from a $4000 engine rebulid to a $400 housing replacement.  They even suggested someone for the transmission issue. Thanks also to the friends who suggested them!"
positive,"We needed a new transmission for our 2014 Jeep Compass... long story, but AAMCO found us a 2014 transmission with only 6,000 miles and a very good price.  They followed through on everything they said and the car was ready in less than one day.  Very very pleased with their professional service and timliness.  I would highly recommend."
positive,"Just got my Jeep back, and I'm in awe by how much generosity Alan has shared. He went above and beyond my expectations. A transmission issue that turned into an electrical connector issue that was finally fixed and now my Jeep runs smooth and amazing. I couldn't thank them enough! I will always bring all of my vehicles to Goodyear!"
positive,From moment i walked in till my problem was diagnosed i was informed the whole way. Treated great..i was Told my transmission was fine and recommended me in the right direction for no Charge.. Gotta love that..
positive,"While traveling through Vegas, my car was behaving badly, I looked on yelp, Called Samurai Motors, Yoshi had me bring the car right in.  I thought for sure something bad like the transmission was broke, turns out thermostat was over heating the transmission.  He was so honest, pleasant, fast and courteous.  Had me back on the road in a couple of hours.  I am so grateful to have found Yoshi.  I will probably have to drive to Vegas for repairs since I found someone trustworthy of my baby."
positive,"I have to say that my experience with this shop this far has been amazing! Went in for a smog knowing that I was going to fail since I had my check engine light on, a mechanic I had taken it to the week before had changed a part only for the light to come back on and said he wasn't able to get to it til the following Monday. They quoted me a price and told me they can service my car today, so I wouldn't have to wait they are very straight forward with their business and don't try and rip you off. Since I hadn't planned on getting it done and had no ride they even went as far as dropping me to my apartment that was 7 mins away so I wouldn't have to wait there, talk about going above and beyond for their customers! They found a lot of mistakes the other shops have made with my car and are actually getting to the bottom of this annoyance of continued check engine light fiasco! I will not go anywhere else now that I've found such honest, and amazing service!!"
positive,"I've had to have my car repaired twice recently and both times I took it to Sunland Auto.  They are very professional, honest, thorough with their work and reasonably priced.  They also completed the work exactly when they said they would.  They are very reliable."
positive,"Chose this place because of the good ratings and it was reasonably close to work. 2000 Chevy S-10.....I had leaks and thought it was the radiator. Turns out it was oil, transmission fluid and the radiator was all mud. They fixed everything and charged less than I was expecting. Very experienced and polite staff. They fix more than just radiators. Totally happy with the experience."
positive,"Honestly I can't say enough about he neighborhood garage. When it comes to mechanics you want fair prices and honest assessments and you get both easily.   I took my car in for some pretty heavy work on the transmission and Andrew and crew did a great job and even fixed a few things for free that I didn't even know were broken.   

The beauty of this garage is unlike firestone or goodyear they are not trying to constantly upsell you with things you do not need.  Would definitely recommend."
positive,"I am so pleased with both the sales and service departments.

Service Dept- I purchased a used VW Jetta from another dealership and brought it to this VW for service. They were so friendly and helpful. Bruce answered all of my questions, put me in a loaner, and called me daily with updates until my car was fixed. My car was dropped off on a Saturday to get a bew transmission and we picked her up Wednesday night, even though the tranni had to come from out of state.

Sales Dept-  My fiance traded in his truck the night we went to pick up my VW from being serviced. He walked out with a VW GTI. We bought from Angela Greeley and she was great. We had a lot of questions and anything we needed, she addressed. From test drive, to trade in, financing, thru walk around of the new car, everything seemed to be easy breezy and we never felt pressured. 

In the future, we will be going here for all of our VW servicing. I highly recommend them above Findlay Henderson or Desert for any of your VW needs."
positive,"I brought my 99 Expedition into the shop twice to get serviced. The first time was because it was idling constantly like it was going to shut off, slow acceleration, and needed to get the check engine light off/pass emissions. All work completed within 3 hrs and done properly. I now have peak acceleration, no more stuttering and passed emissions. Second time a metal piece had broken from behind my back right tire and had cut my break line. They replaced that break line and the broken metal piece. Had work completed in a little over 1 hr and that includes waiting for parts. Now I'm rollin' right again!! They also have good customer service. They talk to you with respect. I will definitely be returning when needing work done in the future and will recommend them to my friends and family. Good biz A & A!!"
positive,Went in this morning for a full synthetic oil change. They replaced my air filter and topped up my transmission fluid. I also used a $15 coupon found on their website. It was fast and easy and they even vacuumed my floors!
positive,First let me start by saying you can't go wrong taking your car to cals. Numerous times has he done things at very little cost or free for me. he will always look at your car and not charge you for that. he is honest and nice. we take both are cars in. we don't have to wait more then a few days/ his shop is small with only two bays so best to call and make a apaointment or let them know your gonna drop your car off. he will allow you to buy your own parts and drop them off and only charge labor or he will order parts for you. hes done break and roders for us worked on exhaust problems patch up lines/replaced transmission lines. never had a issue. always busy though most times it will take a few days to get your car back but its worth it.
positive,Was recommended this establishment by a friend and had a great experience Billy is very helpful and a straight shooter and would recommend to anybody needing transmission work you can count on Billy being upfront and honest.
positive,"I thought the high ratings were a little odd, but these guys really ARE awesome!

My brakes were grinding *really* bad and my check engine light was on. After going to a shop in West Las Vegas where my friend had the ""hook up"" (but turned out to be whack) I decided to travel all the way out to this place after seeing their Yelp reviews. 

I had a bad feeling that it was too good to be true: an honest mechanic with fair prices  and WiFi in the lobby. But it was all true!

The owner was working the front desk and he was very friendly. After checking my car he explained everything to me clearly and even took me in the garage and showed me my brakes and what was good and what was bad. I explained to him my experience at the WLV shop and he gave me a discount because THEY were jerks. Wow, who does that?

While waiting in the lobby I was able to use the WiFi to do my work. The owner asked me where I was from, and when I said Colorado Springs, he immediately turned the channel from ESPN to the news so I could watch live updates on the Waldon Canyon Fire that was destroying my hometown. Again, who does that? Very nice family business!

It was a great experience that was worth the drive. I highly recommend them!"
positive,Talk about class and customer service. Had a bad experience with Camelback Collision and had to take my car to get it repaired at another shop. After a lot of research I decided upon Michael's. What a great group of people. Very knowledgeable and helpful. They explained to me what was wrong and showed me diagrams of what it is supposed to look like. My appointment to get the car repaired is now scheduled. I have the utmost confidence that my car will be in good hands and look like new. Thank you Michael's Collision :-)
positive,"Real deal mechanic, honest, and informative. I wanted to get a new muffler for my Rhino and it was in really bad shape and he gave me good advise and recommendations without pinching my pocket."
positive,"Text from me - My car won't start.  When can you take a look?  I can carpool with my wife.  
Anytime Auto - Tomorrow

Next day
Anytime Auto - Fuel pump is the problem.  
Me - lookup how to replace a fuel pump on my car at YouTube.   Nope, don't want to have anything to do with that.  Lookup what a fuel pump and filter cost online.  Wow, they aren't making much profit on this repair - those things are expensive.  

Text from me - Go ahead and fix it.  
Anytime Auto - Its fixed.  

How easy is that?   Left the old parts without me asking.   Did you know old gas pumps have gas in them?   I do now.  

Fast, easy, complete, reasonably priced repair.   I have an older car that I expect to drive for a few more years.  I think I just found a new friend.

Second repair 

I had the best intentions to change my front brakes.  Bought the parts six months ago.  Found brakes don't get better just because you buy the parts.  Life happens.  Called Anytime Auto to schedule service.  When was the last time you asked a mechanic to use your own parts?  With Anytime Auto, no problem.  Price was less than advertised brake jobs that use lower quality parts and try to up sell better parts.  

Two repairs, two home runs.  Thanks for providing a great service!"
positive,"I really appreciate the time and consideration Donald and the other employees put into rebuilding my transmission. He was considerate about my financial situation and tried to keep the cost down. I was shown some parts they replaced and it was obvious that work needed to be done. Sometimes it's a concern, not being familiar with car issues, that I may be taken advantage of. I was not concerned about this at all. I feel like you can trust them and their work."
positive,"Starbucks coffee is utter garbage.  If you want quality coffee, I can give you five other coffee shops on State Street which serve coffee that doesn't taste like it was filtered through an old muffler.

Why four stars, then? The service. I have never ever been made to feel like I'm bothering them when I order my drink.  THAT is why I go to Starbucks versus the hipper coffee establishments down the street.  This location has the best service I've ever seen ANYWHERE.  I've never seen such friendly baristas.  Is the coffee spiked?  

Look, if you work at a Starbucks near campus, you're going to deal with all sorts of characters: bratty undergrads, random homeless, impatient businessmen who have important meetings, etc, etc. I've never seen an employee lose their cool.  In fact, they look like they're having fun most of the time.

Come for the awesome service, stay for the meh coffee."
positive,"My fiancé's has her battery and check engine light come on at 3:30 pm on a Tuesday. I called at 9:30 Wednesday, and the car was fixed by that night. Incredible repair service, incredible customer service, I was so impressed.

Not only that, but they actively tried to save me money rather than shotgun-ing parts to solve the problem. Hands down the best experience I've had with a repair shop. I will be back again."
positive,Jay is the man! Super quick and efficient. Super affordable prices. Brought in my car to get all my engine and transmission mounts replaced. Car doesnt jerk as much as before. Content with the results. Highly recommed to anyone and everyone.
positive,"Phenomenal, top-notch at-your-home or place of business service.  Repaired my wife's car's windshield in record time.  Opted for them again when my own windshield cracked.  Installer finished in record time . . . but I soon discovered he had broken my rear-view mirror.  Very upset when I found out he had tried to secure it inside the mount using double-sided sticky tape . . . and when he told me that this was a ""trick of the trade.""  Guess he didn't know I used to be an automotive engineer/mechanic.  So I spoke directly to Stuart (one of the owners) who is the HEIGHTH of professionalism; he ended up getting me a completely new mirror and driving out to install it personally.  Still in shock over that--how many bosses take that kind of trouble these days?  Everthing was fixed to my satisfaction.  I cannot comment enough on Stuart's professionalism and his going out of his way to help me and ""make it right.""  Please give him all of your auto glass business!!!!!"
positive,"Go here, go here, go here.  The people are friendly fast and knowledgeable.  I had my 2005 Corvette in for a job that the Chevy dealer was quoting me a range of $2000 - $7000 for.  They did the work with upgraded parts for $557.  The car runs better than new.  I am one happy camper and will be back if I ever need more transmission work!!!!"
positive,"I've taken my car here at least 3 times and they've always been great. The first time I needed a new muffler (on a car with 36,000, I was not happy) but they found a muffler and charged me something like $30 to install. I was really happy since the whole thing didn't cost as much as I had guessed it would. Next, I had another problem with my muffler, something further up I guess. It was in winter of 2014 and like 18 inches of snow had fallen that day so the owner drove me home while they fixed me car (I can usually walk/bike). Again, it wasn't too expensive to fix. Most recently, I needed new brakes. I made an appointment for Saturday morning and was able to come get it after they closed."
positive,"Shopped all over Las Vegas for the best price and expertise on a transmission service for my 83,000 mile 2005 Jaguar XK8. Got prices ranging up to and over the moon. PepBoys said they could not do it because they did not do sealed transmission services, and referred me to AAMCO on S Valley View. Kyle at AAMCO not only gave me the best price of all, he answered all my in-depth questions so there was no doubt that this shop knew what they were doing and what parts and which synthetic ATF fluid were really needed. I also got a great quote on replacing the old brake fluid with new DOT 4 fluid. I made an appointment for the next day, but had to drop the car off very early so I could be at work on time. I thought I was going to have to leave it outside their locked lot gate and throw the keys over the fence, but amazingly, Scott, the owner, was there at 6:30 AM to let me park my car safely inside, (even though they don't open until 8:00 AM).  He told me he had owned the shop for 30 years, and even showed me the service bays, (extremely clean), which gave me even more confidence. When I returned to pick up the car after work, I asked to see the old filter, which they had saved just so they could show me that I had no problems developing. While I was there to pick up my car, I was very pleased with the courtesy, professionalism. and excellent work of this AAMCO shop on S Valley View and I am convinced of their honesty and integrity. If they can't do something, they will tell you up front, and help direct you to a shop that can address a specialty need. Super nice people; you can't find a better car shop in Las Vegas. I highly recommend this AAMCO shop to anyone with car care needs."
positive,"I called store to order transmission for our car and was quoted a price that was 50 dollars more than  ordering it online at the website, I recommended you try online order first before calling.  Other than the price change I like that you have a variety of choices and prices on in stock auto parts without all the hassle of removing the used part yourself from a u pull it...Thank You Arizona Auto"
positive,"Best mechanics EVER.  So nice and explained everything to me. Even using the coupon, Dennis explained what he was going to do and I could stay and wait or get a ride home.  I stayed and it took only one hour to drain transmission fluid and another fluid which I can't remember.   (senior moment)  The dealership wanted to charge outrageous amount for this service, and Joe's was 1/3 the cost. They are my auto shop for life."
positive,"A couple days ago, I fired up my car and started driving towards downtown so that I could attend the Yelp Eats UYE at Nobuo. Only problem was it was 104 outside and my AC wasn't working.

Luckily, I'm a savvy dude, and had a pretty good idea about what COULD be wrong. I called Lightning Lube, my go-to for all things car. They recommended I give Ray a call at First Class.

I took it in, told him what was up, and he recharged my AC within 30 minutes, and I was out the door. He's honest, fast, reliable and the kind of guy you want working on your car.

His prices are reasonable, and it seems as if his staff does all kinds of work. I will certainly come back. 

He will make conversation with you, explain what is going on, and then give you options. The other thing that is key here, is that he won't just start working on your car, until you tell him to. He'll help you out and figure out why your check engine light is on and give you random advice on your car if you ask for it.

I was originally going to go to Whitey's since everyone in Old Town seems to go there, but Whitey's is closed on weekends. I'm glad they are, because meeting Ray was the best thing that could have happened to my car. 

BRING YOUR CAR HERE!"
positive,"People, please note this muffler shop is in Sunnyslope. The address on the business card is 902 W. Hatcher Rd and the zip is 85020, but this is the same place as far as I can tell. Phone number is 602-997-0906 and the website is http://www.maestromufflers.com/ . You will find a picture on the website. Be warned that this is probably an old picture. If you are not comfortable going to a small operation where people are just trying to make an honest living, this is not the place for you. 
That being said and warnings given, I highly recommend this shop. I received a ticket for a noisy muffler, and having limited funds to correct the issue (whether it was actually an issue or not is open to debate), I purchased a universal muffler from O'Reillys( who also deserve a good review).
I was hoping someone I knew would know how to weld, but that was not the case. I had read the reviews here on Yelp, and was going to take it to Mighty Muffler, which is in the general area, but it was Saturday and they were closed. I drove past this shop and decided to ask if they would remove the old muffler and install the new. I was told it would be a 10 minute wait before they could get to it, and $40 for the labor, and this was actually the case. I was then told it would take 25 minutes to do. It was closer to 20 minutes and although I was asked if I would like to purchase a muffler tip for an additional $10, because it was purely cosmetic ( I was told this-an example of how since I didn't know he could have told me it was needed, but did not), I declined.
My car is quieter, and the part of the experience that matters to me-time and money- couldn't have been better. If time and money are your priorities too, do yourself a favor and give these guys a chance,and they are bi-lingual if needed."
positive,"My transmission was slipping in my truck and I researched shops on YELP and stumbled across Kens. From the moment we called them, they were nothing but helpful, honest, friendly, and very knowledgeable. Their price was significantly lower than the rest (about 20 other shops that we called) and they included a warranty. I got my truck back and it is running like a champ! I am so very pleased and will recommend them to any family member or friend. Phil was wonderful to work with and Ken was great too!"
positive,"I dropped my car off for 2 claims, and let me just say my car looks incredible! They are very friendly and courteous! They called and updated me throughout the whole process! You can't even tell my car had damage! Very pleased!! Hopefully I never have to have my car repaired again but if I do I will definitely take it here to gerber!!"
positive,"Read the reviews, anything less that 4 stars is a bogus review!!!! 
Had my 97 Lexus LS400 transmission looked at today. Cured all her ills and the black beauty is running like the proud mare that she is.

Gripples"
positive,"It has been a long time since I attended a drive-in, but the results were pretty good, despite the usual idiots in the world. You had the guy who can't stay in his car and is smoking a cigarette, the kids running around screaming and various other minor annoyances. We moved spots once and everything was good. The radio transmission was excellent and the snack bar was well stocked. It was about 7 bucks and we stayed for one movie. In general, this is a fun experience once in awhile and the Churro was great."
positive,I called four different places and got four quotes that were twice as high as affordable muffler. They had my car completed on time (with in just a few hours) for half the price of other places. My father is a master tech at a Ford dealership and rather than repair my van at the dealership he told me to go here for a better price and faster service. I wouldn't recommend another place for muffler work. Just know they wont do anything else but mufflers. No air in the tires no oil change nothing just mufflers and exhausts.
positive,"I was worried about my drive after reading some of these reviews, but honestly, this was an awesome experience.  I'm a huge Ferrari fan and driving one of these cars is something I've wanted to do since I was 16.  My reservation for the F430 was one of the last appointments on a weekday, so I didn't have any trouble with wait time like some of the other posts have mentioned.  I walked in and we pretty much headed right down to the garage.  I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars though because I will agree that the actual drive time is pretty short.....15-20 min in the car sounds about right.  40-45 minutes to walk around the relatively small showrooms (upper and lower) is way more than you need.  I think they should be a little more clear about that in the Groupon since it does lead you to believe that you'll be driving the car for an hour.  You won't.  That said, it seems from other reviews that the amount of fun you can have in your time driving the car is largely dependent on traffic and your instructor (guide?).  I lucked out on both.  There was almost 0 traffic on the roads we took and my instructor was cool and knew I was there to DRIVE a Ferrari.  The instructor started by showing me how everything worked (it helped that I already knew what every switch and button in the car was for) and what the car was capable of.  Then I got my turn behind the wheel. Once I demonstrated that I could drive, follow directions, and not act like a complete idiot with an used car that still resells for over $100K, I was free to use all 4.3L and the open road as I saw fit.  It was amazing.  The noise that thing made was unreal, and the steering and brakes made it feel like a big go kart on the road.  For me, the experience I had in a car of that price and performance level was absolutely worth $100.  If you're not fanatical about these cars, or you get bogged down with traffic or a boring instructor, I can completely understand why you wouldn't think it's worth the money.  My advice is either 1) pray for a good instructor and shoot for a slow day/time to avoid wait times and traffic, or 2) pony up another couple hundred bucks to do one of the exotic car school out at the speedway.  When I was in Vegas I think the speedway was about $300 for 5 laps - you'll ultimately get less time in the car ( having never been there I'm ballparking it at about 5 laps @ 1:30/lap = 7-10m) but you are guaranteed to be able to push the car since it's track time.  In true Vegas style I guess it's a bit of a gamble :-)

P.S.  I heard they were having problems with the Gallardo's engine and that it was probably going to be a bit before they got it fixed.  Not sure how long ago that happened, but it may be why some people were told their car wasn't available...also a good thing to know if you are planning on making a reservation for the Lambo in the future.  IMO, the Ferrari is the better ""driver's car"" anyway ;-)  If you got bumped from your drive with the Ferrari, well then I have no idea what happened there.  I'd also like to clarify that in some of the other reviews on here, the Ferrari is referred to as ""automatic.""  The car actually has a semi-automatic, F1-style transmission (shift paddles behind the steering wheel).  The car does have a fully automatic mode that some instructors may choose to keep drivers in, but my instructor let me use the paddles to change gears manually."
positive,"Amazing customer service. I had a major issue going on with my car (the doors weren't closing....yeah, scary). I spoke to John (fleet service dpt) and he told me to come in asap, he got my a loaner, and made everything super easy for me. Everything was covered under my warranty, which made things even better, but they went above and beyond my expectations. Not only did they get the doors fixed, but they also noticed my transmission was going out, so they fixed that too. Can't say enough great things about this place. There's a reason why they have the best ratings out of all the other ford dealerships in the valley....they're great!"
positive,"I brought my subaru in for a tranny rebuild and they did such a great job on the rebuild. I am giving 5 stars not just for the rebuild, but the customer service as well. From start to finish Sabrina(shop foreman), kept me up to date with every little detail. I wanted to make sure everything was being done right and up to the time projected so I called in every other day, the great thing being that they didn't get annoyed with me but were polite and honest with me.    
They took the time needed to make sure the job was done right and were even able to save me some money on the rebuild compared to other shops.
I originally took my car to a general repair shop to install a used transmission I bought, and what a mistake that was! They installed it incorrectly causing damage to vital parts of the transmission! I had no idea but thanks to good care transmission and them exposing this info. to me I've been able to get my money back from that shop. Word of advice, if your having tranny problems just take it to a transmission shop such as this one. There are specialist for a reason."
positive,You wont find anywhere better to take your car than to Joey at Bellisario's.  This is the third experience over the past 6 years in having my car repaired there.  Whether minor or major damage the final result is perfect every time! You will drive away with a car looking better than new! The service is top notch and very smooth.  Joey and his guys know exactly what to do and they take much pride in their cars.  Only place I will trust with my car.  You can't go wrong!
positive,"I heard the ad on the Howard Stern show. The idea of renting an Audi A4 over the traditional car rental sounded appealing. I have had been going to Las Vegas for 16+ years and the horror stories I experienced with my rental cars is endless. From transmission failures, to BO cars to absolutely filthy cars is no more. The first thing to do is download the Silver Car app. If you don't have a smart phone, get one.  From there everything will be done with your smart phone. They are in most major cities. Make your reservation from the app. The app shows your reservation and an email will arrive shortly. Once you land in Vegas, launch the app and take the bus to the car rental facility.  Once at the car rental facility, push the button that will summon Silver Car. A text message will indicate they are on the way. They will inquire as how many are in your party. Walk over to the taxi/other pickup and wait. The pickup is at the back of the taxi line. They are only a little over 2 miles away, so it won't take long.  Once they arrive in a silver Audi A4, they want to see a drivers license and proof of insurance. They brought us two bottles of cold water. If all is ok, they will take you back to Silver Car on Sunset. The cars are right out front. A walk around the car and the Silver Car rep goes over any marks/items identified. You will use your app to unlock the car.  I let the rep know I have an Audi, so I did not need the ins and outs of the car. The car comes with wifi, Sirius radio,nav and very comfortable leather seats. The car was showroom clean. The rep was as nice as one could be. No lines, no waiting for people who don't have insurance, a driver license or a credit card.  We had a 2015 model, however the nav was useless. It was the type where you have to use a wheel to spell out words. We tried to use the talk button for the nav but no luck. We just used the wifi and our phones. We are told if we choose to refill the cars gas, to use 91 octane.  Also, we were told when we return the car back to them, they would take us back to the airport, which they did. Early Saturday, I received a text message asking if my time to return the car changed. I let them know, it was pushed up 1 hour.  

Just a note, they were only $30 more than Thrifty who was the least expensive I could find through Expedia.

I will use Silver Car again on my trip back to Las Vegas. This was my best car rental experience in Las Vegas in 16 years of going there from beginning to end."
positive,"I had a positive experience with this location. I do majority of work on all of my vehicles but certain things I chose to pay for. My transmission service was completed in an acceptable amount of time and two weeks later there are no issues from the work performed.
The technicians were professional and the manager i spoke to was very easy to work with. Ask for Cameron and he will take care of you and your vehicle."
positive,We were on our way to Vegas when my check engine light showed on the dashboard. I called Audi Las Vegas and talked to Boyd in service. This place has the best service that I have experienced in my 30 years in comparison with Mercedes Benz and Bmw combined. It's truly a superb experience from the call that I made to schedule an appointment up to picking up my car at 2 pm on a Black Friday. The loaner that they gave me was the same car that I was driving. Boyd is definitely an asset to the service department. Thank you guys.
positive,"I've been looking for a manual transmission, base model 2013 Fit with no ridiculous options added to it, and having little luck. I walked away from negotiations at another Honda dealer after feeling that I was getting the cliche salesman/sales manager tag team with ridiculous strategies to bump up the price. So I walked Tempe Honda's lot, found three cars that had only a few small dealer-added options on them, and went inside to talk. Efrain Canizales was excellent. He asked what I was looking for, and worked to arrive at a good deal without any game playing. Similarly, Dutch Trevel was helpful and not pressuring when we got to financing. I really couldn't be more satisfied,and I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again."
positive,Was in Cave Creek from out of town for the weekend. My 2008 Honda Pilot's engine started smoking. Called their store at 5:15 and Adrian said to bring the truck in. Even though the store closed at 5:30 he stayed 30 minutes late and diagnosed my problem to be a bad alternator. They were closed the next day but recommended a garage for me to take my truck to and gave me a ballpark price I should expect to pay for the work i needed done. Got the part installed and made it back to Vegas safe and sound and not stuck on a desert freeway on a Sunday afternoon. I can't thank the staff and Adrian enough for their honesty and compassion for a out of town guy in trouble. If I lived in Cave Creek this would be the garage I would get my car repaired at. Thank you again.
positive,"Marshall's is the only place I've ever really trusted to tell me what's going on with my car, and not screw me over.
I've used them for three years, and, until recently, I had a really beat-up, crappy car. It needed TONS of repairs, but they were always really nice about telling me which things needed to be fixed for my safety, and which things could wait. They actually tried to save me money.. amazing. One time, my muffler was starting fall off. I told them my budget for repairs, and instead of trying to cheat me out of as much money as possible, they actually wound some wire around the muffler, free of charge, to keep it going. They also superglued something in my windshield wiper for me, once, to keep it going (saying, of course, that they couldn't promise me it would stay, but they wanted to try to save me hundreds of dollars...guess what? It stayed for over a year). These guys are amazing, and they really know what they're doing. And, unlike some other mechanics I've been to, they are really professional and polite.

Even better? I read an old newspaper article about the guy who owns this place. He actually saved someone's life when he was hiking in the Grand Canyon years ago, carrying an unconscious hiker up halfway until rescue crews could get her. That's how much you can trust him :)"
positive,"When you're driving across the Arizona Desert the last thing you want to do is break down.  Luckily for me, in addition to the Lizards that live there, people do.  And, I found a great auto repair shop when my cars ""check engine"" light decided to come on and I was still a long way from my San Francisco home.  I was ready to call AAA for a tow because I had no idea what to do.  I thought for sure I dropped my tranny.  Lucky for me, I found Daniel's Total Car Care on google.   Daniel recommended that I come to his shop and walked me through a diagnosis of my car which solved my check engine light issue once we added fluids.  Daniel checked over my entire vehicle and after a small stopover of only an ninety minutes, he added some fluids and changed a belt (which looked like it was on the verge of breaking) and I was on my way back to SF after spending less than $300.  The best part, was that I was treated better than when I am in SF and they knew I was driving through Phoenix so was not a likely repeat customer.  It's nice to find an honest shop that can help in a pinch.  Unfortunately, I doubt I'll find myself back in Arizona but I highly recommend Daniel's Total Car Care if you find yourself in area."
positive,"I needed a modification to a Japanese-made motorcycle muffler, and found Maestro while looking for an exhaust shop that was open on Saturdays.  The gentlemen who greeted me at the shop made the modification perfectly in just a few moments using their swaging machine -- and they didn't even charge me a dime for the work.  I plan to visit them again when I have any significant metalworking or mechanical needs for my bike or my truck."
positive,"When it comes to car repairs, I always get nervous. My nervousness is coming from helpless feeling....how would I know what they are telling me is correct or even necessary.. ""we found that such-and-such is not working correctly, then if you fix that, you will need to fix this too..."" Believe me, there are more than a dozen times I thought about changing my career and go to an auto mechanic school. That way, nobody can take advantage of me when it comes to car repairs. 

So, naturally I felt a huge knot in my stomach when my daughter's car stopped in the middle of I-71 on her way back to Columbus, about 70 miles away from Cleveland. We knew what went wrong.... her transmission... I admit that we have been putting it off as long as we could. Everybody says transmission jobs are expensive no matter what they have to do. 

After my research on the Internet, I decided to buy a re-manufactured transmission and let someone install it. Don't get me wrong... it was not cheap, but as expected. The transmission vendor found A J Automotive to install the transmission for a very reasonable charge. 

Keith at A J Automotive was my contact person for this job. He sounded very nice on the phone and assured me that they would take care of it in no time! Since the transmission delivery was coming from out of state, we were not sure when it would be delivered to A J. Keith kept me informed of the status by calling me a couple of times before the transmission finally arrived. 

Once they started to work on the car, he called me again and explained the problem in detail in plain English. Then he explained additional supplies and parts (really minor stuff) that he did not included in the original quote (because they did not know about them until they actually worked on the car) and itemized each price. Very fair. 

So I think they deserve a 5-star review because I felt like they were very honest. I did not feel like they were trying to take advantage of me, not even remotely. I just had a very pleasant experience and that was my first time feeling this way while dealing with car repairs! 

Bonus point: A J Automotive has car wash/detail facility adjacent to the repair facility. When they finished with my daughter's car, they washed her car, made her tires shiny, cleaned her windows, then vacuumed the inside of her messy car - at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE! We didn't ask for it, it was just done and gave us back a very clean car! 

I think I found my car repair shop. Thank you, A J Automotive for your fairness and honesty!"
positive,"My review is for the service department. 

Twice in a time crunch Bill Abbott has come to the rescue. First, my check engine light kept turning on and then off at various points and then started stalling out on my drive home for a family get together. I was able to bring my car here at the last minute on a Saturday, have it worked on and fixed within four hours. The service technician even explained the issue to me to the point that I understood what needed to be fixed. 

Next, over Christmas I was able to bring it in when it sounded as though there was something wrong with the rear suspension of my car. They were able to get the parts and fix it within a few hours and I was completely satisfied with the level of service I received as well as the price.  

Waiting area isn't the best but they have a TV and some magazines to look through if you choose to wait for your vehicle."
positive,"My review after two years later 5/5! Reason I wanted to do a review now because I paid additional 1 yr. warranty on my rebuilt transmission.  

I have a 2009 Toyota Camry and paid about $2000.00 for rebuild and additional for warranty.
They are friendly, reasonably priced, and fast.  I've had no issues with my transmission since it has been rebuilt.  Would definitely recommend this place!"
positive,"An honest and friendly shop that does not rip you off.   I was going on a road trip and my check engine light came as soon as I arrived at LV.  I brought my car here to be checked out.  They were fully booked for that day and the day after but one of the guys (the owner/manager?)  was very friendly and nice to spend the time to scan my vehicle for codes, perform a quick check, and made recommendations.   He pretty much told me to not worried and that I should enjoy my trip as there's no safety issues.  I can just bring it to my regular shop when I return home if the light comes on again.  

Initially I was worried that I may be ripped off being out of state visitor.  My experience here far exceeded my expectation, the best I have seen in quite some time.  It's too bad that they are not located next to where I live."
positive,"I had a check engine light pop up on my BMW and during cold starts in morning a puff of white smoke would be exhausted. These guys know their German vehicles. Great service, prompt diagnosis and to top it all Owner Chris and GM Ryan are the best in my books. Reasonable and honest comes to mind. Give them a try for sure because you will be impressed and happy."
positive,"Very friendly staff and excellent work. My truck had been sitting for just over a year as the transmission went out. Took it into them, and fixed in no time. Easy finance plan with 90 days interest free. Taking the truck back for the rest of the maintenance needed on it."
positive,"Sean runs a tight ship. Best oil change experience I've ever had, including changing my own oil. -_- 

In and out in under 20 minutes, even with a transmission flush. (I was over 30,000 miles)

Come here. Forget your troubles, you don't even have to get out of the car if you don't want to. 

Go online to their website for a coupon. Too easy."
positive,As far as a dealership goes... this is my top favorite of all time. Ive never been pressured by a pushy salesman. Mostly the sales people welcome you and leave you to exploring. I even service my car there or at least inquire about service quotes. They don't always get my business of course. Definitely ask questions if something doesn't sound right. For instance... I had a guy in service quite my for new struts. He told me 589$ for all four struts. 588$! That's an amazing deal. I asked him several times in person and he swore that was correct. I decided to walk away and call later. Of course I found out upon calling later that the 589$ was incorrect. He was only half right ;)   However... that is the o key time I was miss informed. I had a civic hybrid years ago and they were great with a recall on the transmission. As well as handling a recall with my CRV. Can't forget to mention the complimentary coffee and soda machine and waiting area. This location is on the outskirts of the NW Vegas area... but worth the drive.
positive,"Professional, Honest, Family owned and run business. Excellent service. They do more than transmissions also. Going back for oil change and tune-up. Double A beep beep MCO!"
positive,"I had the opportunity to work with Jay on my 2000 Toyota Camry. Got an oil change, and he had it ready for me within the hour. Jay has great communication skills, and is just a down-to-earth dude. He even gave me an update on my check engine light, by telling me exactly what the codes told him, and offered to work on it if I desired to come back, which I will. If you're looking for a non-corporate auto repair shop, I recommend you talk to Jay. You can find his shop off of Deer Valley and 14th Ave. going south, it's at the end of the street to the right past a gate. It's not that hard to find but it is tucked away behind a building. If you see him, let him know that Jonathan sent you!  His prices are very reasonable, and his work is great! He has 20 years of auto repair experience, and it shows with his care on your vehicle."
positive,I had a good experience here. My civic's check engine and transmission light went on all of a sudden and I could tell something was wrong with gear changes.  I called and Jack said he would look at it without charging me for diagnostic test. They looked at it and said something was up with transition which could be as simple as wiring or as bad as needing a new transmission and they wouldn't know til they took it apart for a closer look. I left my car for the weekend. One issue I have is that they didn't call me and update me on what they found and how much it would cost... my car was supposed to be ready by Monday. I called on Sunday to get an update and they told me that the part hasn't arrived and it would take at least until Tuesday which I would have appreciated knowing earlier as it caused some issues with my rental car. They did negotiate a good price with me and were pleasant with overall good customer service.
positive,The store manager was very helpful and knowledgable. She went out of her way to help me when I came in just to get my transmission fluid checked.
positive,"**Review for the service department**

Thankfully my Honda has only needed to visit ""the docter's office"" a handful of times (thank you baby for being reliable for 123,000 miles and counting!). I must say each time my Honda has been to the service department at Findlay Honday its been a great experience. I have had my belts replaced here and my airbags (manufacturer's defect). Most recently I brought my baby in because the check engine light kept coming on and the engine was idling high at stoplights. Jason was my service advisor and assured me my car was in good hands. Shortly after I dropped my vehicle off he called with the diagnostic: my EGR valve was clogged and needed to be replaced. The EGR valve is a pretty important little bugger in your emission's system: it is in charge of making sure your car burns gas efficiently. I gave Jason the okay to go ahead with the repair and he said it should be done at 4:00pm. 4:00pm rolled around and I got the call that my vehicle was ready to go. Printed a 10% off coupon from Findlay Honda's website and went to grab my car. Easy. The way car repair should be.

I would have never thought I would be so happy and trusting of service from a dealership. Let's face it, dealerships don't always have the best reputations. Each visit I've made to the service department at Findlay Honda has been pain free (well, except my wallet, no one ever said car repair is cheap!!). The technicians are knownledgeable and helpful; most importantly they are polite. I greatly appreciate that their technicians never speak to you in a demeaning manner. 

Tips to make your improve your experience:
-Call ahead and make an appointment if possible.
-Arrange for a ride to and from the delearship, their lounge is comfy, but you can get a lot more accomplished if you plan your day around your repair.
-Check the website for coupons/deals!! It never hurt anyone to save a couple buck$$$"
positive,"So...  the transmission in my 2006 Jeep Commander was not shifting as it should.  Fearing the worst, I Yelped ""transmission""  With great reviews, I decided I had nothing to lose and stopped by the shop.  The owner and her and son greeted me with open arms as I walked in the door.  In a matter of 15 minutes, a mechanic came out, drove my Jeep around the block, did some diagnostics and told me exactly what was wrong.  It was not the transmission, rather a speed sensor that tells the Jeep when to shift. They quoted me a price, I left my vehicle with them that afternoon and it was ready for me to be picked up at 10am the next morning.  The job paid 2 hours, the part, new transmission fluid and a filter and they charged me exactly what I was quoted, $430... I also learned that they do other vehicle repairs with the exception of tires and smog. I will definitely be back for all my automotive needs.  Their Customer service was impeccable!"
positive,"Had my car on the shop over there for a leaky transmission seal, they could have told me I may need major transmission work.

Well let me add another five store review for these guys. The guys are honest, helpful, and straight forward. These guys come highly recommended, and will use them again when the need arrives."
positive,My mufflers were starting to get louder i found this place by accident they replaced them for 200$. Cheaper than everyone else with warranty. The people are very friendly and sociable and made my wait very enjoyable and fast. I would recommend them to anyone. Sometimes you find a great business by accident. If you ever need muffler work done this is the best place for your money.
positive,"All jacked up on No-Xplode, and pulling out of LVAC at the same time can be an adventure like no other.    Sometime, I'm pulling out of the parking lot and turning right on 215, and not realizing why I'm headed to 168 market for Portuguese egg tarts while I should be turning left and going home back.     Or the other time, when I was on three scoops of that stuff, and  turned north on Eastern for no reason at all, but found this AutoZone location.    

The day before, I just notice that dreaded check engine light went on, and wanted to see what was the issue.   I kind of had a feeling it was TP sensor, because I just installed a KN intake system, but no sense in guessing since Autozone can verity it for free.     I walked in, and there was about a line of five customers ahead of me, but it went by fast, and a woman named Faith helped me.     I asked her if someone could help me on a check engine light issue, and she's smiled and went get her reader.   I was a stunned, because she knew her cars, and told me it was TPS was out of range, but told me to pull out the sensor, and see if it  ran rough or not.     That should be the answer to my problem.    She was right, and somehow talked me into buying a fuel additive, plugs and wires.      Great salesperson, and asked a lot of questions on when the last time I tuned up my car, and change my oil.   I wished my personal doctor would asks that much questions on my health.       

This store is not the nearest Autozone for me,  but I might start coming to this location because of the help that I got.     Good grief, more gas but better help.     Autozone, transfer that woman to the Henderson location, I might popped a fiver for you :)"
positive,"The service here is great. It's off in the boonies and not at McCarran (2miles north), but we went here cus our initial car had a transmission overheat problem in the middle of the desert despite us driving safely with AC on minimal and in the evening, odd, probably the previous people pushed the car too much (it is a rental). Both this location and the San Jose had really good service. They refunded us a day and gave us a new tank. Everyone is super friendly. I'd give it 5star except we were stuck for 30 mins in the desert letting the car cool down. I do recommend them because of their great service though."
positive,"I decided to go with Quality Star Benz due to their excellent Yelp ratings...and walked out knowing the reviews weren't exaggerated whatsoever. Robbie the owner helped me personally and was very considerate and attentive to explaining the details for my car repair. I was in need of a valve body replacement and was working with a budget. Robbie explained the whole process, as well as my cost options and also suggested a whole new transmission due to the cost difference in replacing the valve body and the transmission with consideration of the milage. As a person with a career with emphasis in customer service, I rate this place top notch!"
positive,Had transmission problem for my 2007 Chevy Suburban while visiting Vegas with the family. Showed up at 7:30am and Pam and Kyle were able to fit me in for an inspection. Turns out I needed a new transmission. They ordered a replacement transmission on Monday and work was completed by noon on Saturday. Very friendly and professional. All work was done right/on time at a fair price.
positive,"Brought my Jetta in for a transmission fluid service the other day. My car was ready when they said it would be, they did a great job, and it was more than $100 cheaper than the dealer.

Couple things: the waiting room was completely dark with window blinds shut when I arrived. Someone came in from the shop to greet me shortly after I got there.

Also they don't hardly have any signage. Turn in where you see the ""Deer Valley Commerce Park"" sign. They're about 1/3 of the way down on the left.

I'l definitely be bringing my car back here for everything now. Absolute gem of a car repair shop."
positive,"We've been taking our vehicles here for years now. I feel they are very honest and they do great work. They almost felt bad when our transmission went out, worked with me on payments. Don't quote me but you might get a discount with cash payment."
positive,"I highly recommend Dutch's Auto to everybody!

I took my 1998 Honda Civic there when it was having severe performance and gas mileage issues (and the check engine light was on). They diagnosed it as a cracked catalytic converter that needed to be replaced. I had actually already read the check engine code off previously, and knew that it was related to the catalytic converter, so I had already gotten estimates. The place I normally take my car to in Verona estimated ~$1,000 to do the replacement; Dutch's was able to fully replace the catalytic converter, change the oil, and change the brakepads for half of that! Nan showed the catalytic converter to me after they replaced it, and it had a huge crack along the side of it. She explained the effect that had on the engine; I really like that they take the time to explain these sorts of things.

I also took my wife's Ford Escape Hybrid there when there was an issue with her steering column (it was making a clicking noise when turning). Nan gave me a call and let me know that they were unable to diagnose the issue due to their unfamiliarity with hybrid internals, and they wouldn't charge me for their time looking into it. I appreciated their honesty in admitting that - better than a mechanic messing around when they don't know what they're doing and breaking something.

I also recommended them to my brother when his car needed an oil change and his brakes looked at, and they did a great job for him as well.

The only minor knock I have is that I had to call and check on the status of my car after about a week of not hearing anything back, which I think is probably due to how busy they are due to the excellent work they do and their very reasonable prices. Very much worth the minor hassle for me!"
positive,"My pickup was having trouble shifting up, I took it to a shop that told me I needed a rebuilt transmission.  The next day I took it to Aamco and they fixed the problem in one day by replacing one part.  Total cost of repair? $90
Thanks Aamco"
positive,"I wish I could give 20 stars to this Aamco! Scott (the owner) and his team did an amazing job fixing my car! They went above and beyond for me and my family while staying within my budget. This Aamco is family owned, professional, the shop is clean and immaculate. From the moment I walked in I felt at ease and confident my transmission would be rebuilt correctly. Aamco offers an excellent warranty on all parts and labor and they are nationwide. Keep this in mind if you go to another local shop. We had been through so much before finding this Aamco, which came highly recommended by several of my Father's coworkers who are all police sergeants. This Aamco does all types of car repairs and we will be customers for life. Thank you Scott, Pamela and Kyle for providing us with excellent service."
positive,"Did you ever find that hole in the wall no frills place to eat that you just couldn't get enough of to eat, so you just keep going back? That's how GOOD Maestro MUFFLER & DRIVELINE! About a year ago I started working on a Jeep Grand Cherokee I had bought, U know, AZ style. There's not a lot of custom lifts and stuff for this ride, but I said what the hell I'll try and engineer something. After server long months of trial and error I finally got the thing lifted 6+ inches with no death wobble, when I noticed the front drive line binding from some silly connector hub joint that looked like it was off a VW trans axle? I knew I needed a driveline expert, as I was only good enough to be dangerous...LoL. my neighbor drives an old custom ford 100 pickup truck. And as we spoke of my problem he mentioned Ron and Mario at a place on W. Hatcher called Maestro Muffler & Driveline. I being the skeptic and not wanting to take my Jeep anywhere near Hatcher Rd., but figured what the heck, I'll go see and talk to the guys and try and get a read. Now I had called a couple of custom driveline shops and was quoted what I thought were some ridiculous pricing, as I had already spent thousands! I went there spoke to Ron, he gave me a real fair price to custom build both drivelines and provided a solution to the weird donut hub joint that was in a bind, he also noted my brand new front pinion seal was leaking, told me why, and fixed it at no additional charge, it was simple, but he went out of his way. I also talked to them about a new exhaust system, and they gave me lots of good advice! (more on that ltr.) Ron's work was so good, so professional, and one year later still going strong....Until, I was WHEELIN up in Page AZ. checking out my new transfer case and gears that a Transmission shop had installed on my way home, when all at once, a mammoth vibration and sound from the underside, I new the gears were good, I had new tires, and all I could think of were those drivelines installed a yr. earlier. Well I went back, Ron was there still, and remembered me. He said put it on the rack and lets take a look. We did, and Bam! he points out a loose driveline connection instantly. Trouble is, the transmission shop was the last guys to mess w/it and apparently they didn't tighten up the bolts properly. Ron said NO PROBLEM! fixed me right up and sent me on my way, NO CHARGE! I just bought HP muffler and exhaust tips, guess who's installing and welding them up! Please don't judge a book by its cover, If you want good solid work done at a fair price....THIS IS THE PLACE! They do GR8 custom work!"
positive,"These guys were able to repair my muffler in about 24 hours and the price was competitive compared to the other shop I called. They seem like nice guys, and I think they did good work. The only downside is that they they are a long ways from most public transportation and don't offer shuttle service. It took 90 minutes and 3 buses to get back to my house, which I had to reverse the next day. So make sure you've got a friend able to drive you if you plan on some muffler work here."
positive,"These guys are TOP NOTCH. Period. 

After being jerked around by some other ""mechanics"", I did some Yelp searching early on a Saturday morning to find a well-reputed general maintenance place. Yelp led me to the Neighborhood Garage...and I can see why...

Got there as soon as they opened that Saturday morning to get brakes and an oil change on one car. When we got there, I asked if they minded doing an oil change on my second car as well. They happily obliged and took both cars in immediately with no attitude or hesitation. They completed the oil change on the second car within 30 minutes so I could go on about my day while they worked on the other car.

The first car (brakes and oil change) had been having electrical issues and also had the check engine light on. I asked them to please check the fuses to determine if this was the source of the electrical issues. Not only did they check the fuses, but they checked the OBD codes...for free. Andy (the business owner) was very thorough with his diagnostic explanation and suggestions for repairs regarding the code reads. I appreciated his straightforwardness and the timeliness with which the work was completed. 

They did a great job and were reasonably priced. I will DEFINITELY be taking my vehicles back for future servicing. THANKS!!"
positive,"Had a check engine light on for a few weeks. Took it to the dealer and was told I needed a new transmission. When I called aamco for a second opinion they told me they would diagnose the problem for free and give me a quote. Turned out I only needed a solenoid and a fluid flush. Dealer quoted me $4k, got it taken care of for $350. I'd go back if I had any more problems, an auto shop you can trust."
positive,"I too chose this shop based on their Yelp reviews.  The reviews did not let me down! 

 Scott and his team were honest and professional.  I had spoken to a couple of different places before finding this shop online.  The other places had me convinced that my transmission needed to be repaired / replaced.   I spoke to Scott on the phone and he had me bring it in to be checked for free.  I no sooner walked through the door and he pretty much knew what was wrong with my truck before we even spoke.   As it turns out I had some bad spark plugs and not a 2500.00 transmission.   Thank you Scott and the team at AAMCO.  It's not too often you find honest service like this."
positive,"They have a loyalty card! What!? Seems unheard of for a business that performs oil changes. The staff is great and their prices are very comparable to other business close to them. I asked them if they would add some fluid I bought from autozone to my transmission and they did without hesitation. In addition to all of that, they are very easy to find. Great work!!"
positive,Have had several transmission rebuilt by these guys.  They do a great job and are very thorough.
positive,"I read about how honest this shop is...and they were all correct! I called about getting a transmission cooler put on my car because I was towing a heavy trailer. They took my vin and said they would get back to me. The called the dealer about my car...and found that I have a transmission cooler that comes standard with my car. They let me know I can add an after market cooler, but it probably wasn't needed. They had pricing on a transmission cooler that I could add. I was very impressed!! So many places will not only sell you something you might not need, but add three more things as well."
positive,"I recently had a car repaired here, and to my surprise the owner Tim was actually present at the store. He greeted me when I arrived and personally asked what the problems were that I was having.

Mike the technician, is the one who actually did the repair work on my car. He kept me informed and up-to-date on the entire process. I will admit that the price was a little more that what I wanted, but not being haggled and up sold on product that I really didn't need was worth the couple of extra dollars. Oh, and the cashier Pattie was a doll. She was extreme nice, and her customer service skills were amazing.

Definitely will be returning here. Hopefully for a detail only, and not another repair."
positive,"I don't even live in the area at this shop. It's at least an hour drive for me from my home. It's worth every minute. The owner, Gary,  makes Customer Service a first priority. The skill, Knowledge, and skill of the technicians at the shop are top notch. Every time I went in they went above and beyond their responsibilities to make sure that I was happy. I can't say enough good things about this shop. I wouldn't take a vehicle anywhere else for transmission work."
positive,"The negative reviews on this place are all based on the previous owner/manager. The new owner is great. There is nothing negative you could say about him. 

This is the Purffect Auto Service in the same shopping center as K-Mart and Trader Joe's.

Tomas the owner is 1 of only 2 completely honest mechanics I have met in Las Vegas, and he will give you expert advice as well as ""insider"" advice. When I speak about insider advice, I'm talking about advice which will help you score giant deals on parts. For example, he informed me about a trick you can use to avoid the mounting costs at tire shops, and save like $200 on the total price of your tire installation. I tried it today at the tire shop, and it worked like a charm. Like I said, Tomas is one cool guy who is looking out for customers. 

No matter how busy it is here, they always get me in and out in less than 30-35 minutes. I'm always impressed at his efficiency. 

This is one of those places where they change your oil for less than it would cost if you did it at home. For around $13.00 they give you 5 quarts of conventional oil, a new filter, rotate your tires, top your fluids(transmission, engine coolant), check and fill your air pressure, and much more. And guess what else???For this low price they give you 5w-30 or 5w-20, which is far more particular for your vehicle. Most ""cheap"" oil change places will give you 10w-30, which is a ""once size fit all"" oil that does not work  well in cold climates. Not here at Purrfect Auto, they only use the highest quality materials. 

The shop itself is one of the most state of the art shops in the world. And with all their high tech equipment, they can return your car to you in less than an hour in most cases. 

Because I do all my own car maintenance, I'm pretty good at spotting dishonest mechanics. Not many people can pull a fast one on me, and dishonest mechanics can't rip me off. So, I'm a good judge of character. So that tells you a lot when I vouch for this business. You will have a great experience here at this Purrfect Auto."
positive,"What a quick oil change shop should be.  They were courteous and efficient.  Oil and filter changed, checked other fluids and tire pressure, cleaned windows.  Did not top up windshield washer fluid, tho.  Did do the standard your transmission oil is blah blah upsell but were not overly pushy about it."
positive,"Happy happy happy! It always sucks to get in an accident and have to deal with getting a car fixed. They were fast and easy lol! They set up an appointment exactly when I requested, I showed up and they took me right away. The car was ready in 4 days which was amazing. Other times I have had my car repaired it took a lot more time than this did. The job is well done and I have no complaints. The customer service was great, they kept me updated and took care of all the communication with my insurance. They made sure to call the rental car company to get me a ride. I would recommend them without hesitation."
positive,"I have been going to Affordable for 20 years. They are honest and trustworthy. Also very pleasant! The waiting room has so many thank you letters from customers, as well as estimates from other chain muffler places, and then noted how much Affordable did it for. I recently needed a new muffler, tailpipe, and hangar. They did it for $89. These are great guys, you won't go wrong!"
positive,"This place was very reasonably priced. They fixed the muffler pretty quick. It is first come first serve -  they don't take appointments. The staff was nice, and price was what they quoted."
positive,"Great service,  friendly & honest staff! 
I had a Regal quite some yrs ago that needed a new transmission, needless to say, I brought it to Aamco... Only downfall is I don't remember why I stopped coming here when I got my 06 Lancer... Smh!! Well, I've had my Lancer since 2008 & just about a month ago, felt it was time to change the transmission oil & decided to check back in with these guys... GLAD I DID  Shocked me that they still had my info from the Regal (had to update a few things, but they still had me in the system) Got the trans oil changed, needed the Safety neutral switch replaced, returned for that.. (in luck, they replaced that for me also) Great pricing, honest & friendly!!! Got an appointment set for a Tune up next  Sorry its kinda long...but here in dear ol' Sin City...its hella hard to find honest mechanics...glad I made the choice to return back!!! 
THANKS AAMCO"
positive,"Last week on Friday, April 3, 2015, upon driving out of Red Rock Canyon, the transmission failed on our car. 
We were towed to a repair center on W. Charleston Blvd. The repair was going to take one week, so we decided to rent a car to drive home to San Diego. The repair center recommended Enterprise on W.Lake Mead Blvd., Las Vegas.
Vince took our call. He patiently listened to our predicament and picked us up at the repair center. He then very courteously, with great understanding and explaining, took care of our needs  and worked out a satisfactory rental agreement. We weren't particular about which car to rent, but ended up with a brand new Ford Escape SUV, very comfortable and with great gas mileage. 
On Thursday, April 9th, 2015, we returned the rental car and Vince drove us to the repair center, as our car was again useable.
Without a doubt, because of our wonderful treatment by Vince this has been the best car rental experience we have ever had."
positive,"I have been coming to this shop for several years.  I was in charge of a fleet of limos and have had them do work for me on multiple occasions and every time was flawless.  This is business done on a family level not a corporate one.  Mr. Harvey, his wife and son will be greeting you when you walk in and you might even meet the family dog who has her own corner in the office.  Transmissions are a unique creature and best not done by a regular shop.  When money counts and you are trying to get the most trouble free years out of your car, there is no substitute for having it done right.  Save your precious time and just bring your car here.  They are without a doubt, the best transmission shop in the Las Vegas valley."
positive,"I've gone there on several occasions and never had a problem there, professional and courteous service. 
They added extra transmission oil since my car was low and was only charged for the oil, they didn't add labor charges. 
would definitely go back"
positive,"I am what many would define as a Professional Car Enthusiast. I flew to Maryland to buy a new manual transmission Accord sedan and then drove it back to Phoenix. When I noticed a slight oil leak upon my arrival home I was certainly frustrated. I worked with Scott in the service department who made an appointment for me right away, arranged a loaner, and somehow had my car finished 2 hours after I brought it in. Before I left they introduced me to the mechanic who reviewed the issue, explained his thoughts on the repair, and was generally very thorough about everything. This service is as good as I get from BMW of North Scottsdale without the price. Scott is great to work with!"
positive,Fixed my Grand Cherokee for reasonable amount and in a timely manner. Charged me way less than the dealer would have. I appreciated how Frank kept me informed and was upfront about the whole process. He does other repairs than just transmissions as well. Will now be my go-to guy for auto repairs! He even showed us the part that was replaced when we picked up the vehicle. Not a fancy place by no means but gets the job done! Honesty and integrity are such rare finds and he has got both!
positive,"I found a car that I wanted to purchase on cars.com and it just happened to be at Magic Auto Sales. I've never been a fan of buying cars, and considering I've purchased 5 cars in the last 10 years, I know a thing or two about car buying and the hassle that goes into it. But my experience at Magic Auto changed my opinion about used car buying. From the moment I sent in my online inquiry, my experience was great. Mina, their sales rep, got back to me quickly and answered all my questions. I was very up front about what I was willing to spend and they worked with me to meet my need. There was no haggling or negotiating. Magic Auto was the 4th dealership I had gone to to test drive a vehicle and my experience at the other dealerships almost made me give up but I'm glad I kept searching. Except for the color, which wasn't really that big of a deal for me and not something I'd expect to find unless I was buying a brand new car, I found the exact used car I was looking for. The car had some minor mechanical issues, which they were 100% up front about before we signed any paperwork, but they also said they would take care of the issues after the purchase was complete, which they did. They even asked me to drive the car for a few weeks first to see if I found any other issues that needed to be fixed beforehand so they could fix any other issues that arose. I didn't find any other issues but they fixed the initial issues as promised. About 45 days after I purchased the car, the check engine light came on so I brought it in and they fixed it no questions asked. If you're searching for a used vehicle from an honest and reputable company, I highly recommend Magic Auto Sales!"
positive,"Customer service was good,  and my truck is running great after having the transmission rebuilt!
Thank you for saving me from buying a new truck!"
positive,"I am very impressed with the level of service that I received at Western Petroleum, fast, friendly, efficient staff and service!  As a woman, it's hard to find places where I can take my car and not feel like I'm being taken advantage of.  At Western Petroleum, I received an oil change and had them check out my check engine light and they did exactly what I needed them to do without charging me unfairly or suggesting replacement parts that I didn't need.  In fact, they thoroughly checked my car to ensure everything else was okay and they said everything else was working great!  I will continue to take my car here, because they were AWESOME!!"
positive,"I was really pleased with my experience at Freeway Chevrolet. My Chevy car was experiencing some sporadic issues where the check engine light was coming and going. When it was on consistently, I decided to bring it to Freeway. I called on a Saturday, to which they said to bring my vehicle in just in case they were able to take a look at it that day but planned ahead. When I got there, Rick had already reserved a loaner vehicle just in case they weren't able to get to my car that day. By Monday, the issue was diagnosed and already in the shop, and they even looked further into the issue and found a leak in my AC and made sure the repair would be covered under my the warranty. They were super accommodating with my schedule and allowed me to pick up my car the following Friday without any hassle. Overall happy with the service and my car runs so much better than it did before."
positive,"I went to Affordable Muffler after getting a quote from Midas that exceeded $500. I just thought it had to be more affordable and I was right. Before I get into the details of my transaction, my bill out the door was only $183 so clearly I was not mistaken about the price. 

I had the pleasure of being waited on by Tony, one of the two owners. He was so wonderful I wanted to give him my car when I was done. I couldn't thank him enough. He was kind to every single person who walked in the door. He was helpful and considerate of everyone's time. His nice energy rubbed off on all the customers. I swear we could have all gone out for pizza after the bonding we did. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't that we were there for a long amount of time it was just that Tony set the tone for a nice environment and it was.

OK, enough of the gushing. Bottom line, the car sounds way better aka, the way it should and my purse was not beat up in the process.  Thanks so much to Tony and to all of his hard working crew. I only wish I had more bad mufflers ;-)"
positive,"Stopped into the service department after a check engine light came on while on a cross country trip.  The service agent and tech were very helpful.  I even had a camper attached and they assisted getting me to the garage where they could check the codes.  They got it checked out, topped off my fluids, and sent me on my way with no charge.  I've never left a dealer service department feeling so good.  Kudos to the guys at Findlay North Volkswagen for being helpful, friendly, and honest.  Keep it up!"
positive,"I recently went to Sunland Auto Service for a transmission issue. I got a quote from another place, then, when I had the money for the repair a month later, the original place raised the price by $400! That was enough for me to look for another ""car guy"". I turned to Yelp for the best, and I found them.

Bob and his crew not only re-checked the problem and gave me a 2nd opinion, they charged me less than I expected. I needed a transmission re-build, and  Bob was even awesome enough to work with me on a payment plan. He treated me fairly, kindly, honestly, and trusted me to pay him back with just a handshake and my word. 

I will be back to Sunland if I have any future repair needs. I will also recommend them to everyone I know."
positive,"Scott and Kyle are two outstanding businessmen! They both showed compassion towards my situation, helping me as best they could with great advice during a disappointing post transmission diagnostic. Kyle could have still did the $650.00 repair we initially agreed upon and after the fact produced a claim that there is another problem, but he did none of that. They were 100% honest and upfront. A rare find in the world of auto mechanics. This place has outstanding mechanics, I highly recommend this establishment of you're looking for the best money can buy."
positive,I've been to other shops that want an appointment. These guys took me right in at 7:30 AM. Didn't try to sell me a muffler. Said all I needed was to have the bracket rewelded. In and out in 20 minutes for 25 bucks. The guy's weld is neat and clean. I'm back on my vacation trip.
positive,"Just adding onto and updating my last review that I posted shortly after we got the transmission done.

Unfortunately, we ran into enough problems that we had to actually make use of the warranty that they guaranteed 3 or 4 times. However, I am so glad to say that not once did they act rude towards us or fail to take care of us in any way. Every time we had to come back, it was an inconvenience to us but it was also an inconvenience to them as they could have been working on other customer's cars. So for them to act as professionally and kindly as they did the first time we came to the shop means a lot to us. And I'm sure other consumers would appreciate that as well.

Most businesses whether automotive related or not would not and do not act the same way they did on day one when you come back with an issue. Usually, they grumble, groan, are rude about it, and/or try to figure out a way to leave you high and dry - but not this shop.

They always hopped on it as soon as they could with great turn around times considering these issues weren't really scheduled, and we would just call them to let them know what was going on and then bring the truck in shortly after. Hopefully the 4th time's the charm! And hopefully nobody else has issues with the work they do, but just know that if you do (because that's life and sh*t happens) they will continue to take care of you.

We are thankful for Yelp leading us to this shop because they truly are the best and they are a sincere business that takes responsibility when it comes to their work. They also really only want the best for their customers and despite the trouble we had with our truck, and although I wouldn't jump to recommend other AAMCOs elsewhere, we are very glad we worked with this particular AAMCO to figure out what was going on. My husband and I are mechanics ourselves, and in California AAMCO has an extremely bad reputation, but we just didn't feel confident enough to rebuild this transmission ourselves. So we are glad that this particular AAMCO turned out to be as amazing as the reviews say it is, if not moreso.

We highly recommend this shop to others whether you are mechanically inclined or not. This is an honest, genuine shop that continues to run because they are also truly good at what they do. Thank you again Scott, and your entire team. You guys are rad."
positive,"Greg in the service department was the best, he went out of his way to ensure that me and my family made it to Disneyland safely! My transmission started slipping on our way out of town when he reassured my husband and I that he would get us a loaner car to make sure that we made it to California without a doubt! Thank you for all of you help! We not only made it there safely we had an amazing time and have life long memories to cherish thanks to you!"
positive,"I found Ken's place through my regular mechanic (John's Super Service on McDowell) because John's doesn't do tranny work. Ken's did a replacement
transmission on my old  Grand Caravan and called me when they found something else wrong, for permission to fix. The price was reasonable and never had a problem. Recently, I purchased another used van (the Caravan gone to the Dodge graveyard in the Sky!) and I took it to them for a transmission check, They told me exactly what was wrong, suggested on things to fix now and when I could afford it, and didn't charge me a dime. They even gave me a ride home and picked me up when they were done, without me asking.  This is one of the BEST shops in town, hands down: honest, fair priced, reliable, and friendly. Don't gamble--go by what others say (and YES I read the bad review too, everyone has an Off Day!)  Thanks John for recommending and THANKS KEN for running such a great place!"
positive,Awesome place ! I just got my transmission & motor oil changed for a great price . He also changed my brake light bulb without charging me.
positive,"I live about 50 miles north of Phoenix and so was unfamiliar with reputable Muffler Repair shops there. I looked on Yelp and found Mad Hatter Muffler and Brakes to be rated very highly and located closest to where I live. I called and spoke with Don Mitchell and was told that if I brought my car in that they would get to it as soon as possible. I was given a solid quote and was told that was the final price, and sure enough, it was. Don also was able to use some of the old muffler pipes and used them along with a new muffler. 
I picked up my car after a few hours and the work was completed completely and professionally. I would highly recommend Mad Hatter Muffler and Brakes for any work under the car be it mufflers, suspension, etc. I was so pleasantly surprised to not be greeted by a sales person telling me of other work that needed to be done, that was found during their inspection. I'm so tired of that ploy."
positive,"This was exactly what we needed to see the strip in an open top type of transportation. It was amazing to be on the strip and enjoy the ride with great views. My son absolutely loved it. We both felt like a Million bucks. It definitely drew attention because it's not a car. A three wheeler with car like attributes minus the 4th wheel. 

It was easy to drive and it comes in only manual. There is no automatic transmission. This way is much more fun. The slingshot looks amazing and fleets the attention. The ride wasn't as bumpy as I imagined it. It rides better than most sub compact car but with lots of fun to it. It's unlimited miles, includes insurance, no gas to fill up, easy to rent and absolutely fun. 

It's located in the shops over at Mandalay Bay. If you go to Mandalay Bay drive and do the free valet, take the escalator up to the shops and you'll see the kiosk from where to rent it from. 

Kurt was a very cool guy and he have us a extra time(an hour) at no charge. What a stand up guy when he saw my son very excited to be able to ride in it and just said bring it later if you run over its okay. 

I'm definitely doing this again whenever I come back. Going to rent it longer and take the trip to Lake Mead and Hoover Dam. My son and I loved it!"
positive,"I love the convenience and speed of Valvoline. I have been to this particular location twice and they continue to impress me with their friendliness and speed. Amanda is awesome at what she does! My check engine light came on the other day and they were able to help me figure out the issue along with what other recommended maintenance should be done. I never felt pressured to buy anything or get anything done to my car, they just guided me in the right direction. Being a 25 year old female, I appreciate that so much in the car industry! I will be returning for my routine maintenance to this location."
positive,"Came in for check engine light and they checked it out for free and referred me to somewhere that could help, then also cleaned my front headlights and buffed them for free!"
positive,"This is my second review of this location. As I look back at the other reviews, I continue to be surprised by how variable they are. My experience has been universally good. This time I brought my 2001 Ford Taurus SEL in for a basket of deferred maintenance, including a slow oil leak, a slow transmission leak, and a slow leak in one of the rear tires. 

They diagnosed the fluid leaks exactly as I expected, gaskets. I expected the leaky tire to require the remediation (cleaning) of corrosion from the old aluminum wheels to let the tire seat better, but they correctly identified the problem as a valve stem, and replaced it as a courtesy with the other work. It hasn't leaked in the days since. 

I didn't have an appointment, showed up late morning after the rush-hour rush, and they needed to get a part from another location, so they made no promises. But, they stayed late, after close, until about 9:30pm to get both me and other person (a Civic, I think) done before leaving for the day. I was impressed. 

I find it really convenient, because I can grab a quick lunch at Qdoba or Chipotle, or East Cost Subs while they do things like inspections or tires, or walk to the nearby university, where I work, or hospitals, where friends work, when they keep it for the day. I've never had them need to keep it over night (but gotten close!).  They also sell salt and shovels, which saved me a stop along the way."
positive,Great Service! #1 Oil Shop in Arizona! Guys were knowledgeable and quick with my truck.  Got a oil change and transmission flush. Guy working there gave me information on my truck for different oil change miles and recommendations. Didn't pressure on sales. Shop very clean and comfortable in the waiting area. I will go there every time for an oil change or any service. Owners are great people you don't find around like that anymore! Wish all businesses ran like this and nobody would ever get ripped off. I recommend highly everyone go there!!
positive,"A reliable automotive shop. I have taken my car in multiple times here and they are always quick and I can trust them when they look over my car unlike some other companies who will try to nickel and dime you when you bring your car in. 
They had to refer me to another automotive shop because of an issue with my transmission once and that place was great too."
positive,"My girlfriend has been going to Marshall's for several years because they have been known as being very reputable and honest.  Recently took her car in to be serviced for the check engine light and failed emissions. She decided to hold off on replacing the PCM computer and discuss it with me due to costs of the PCM computer being over $900.00.  She's a teacher for Scottsdale School District and everyone knows how the school district pays teachers in Arizona.  She paid the $125.00 diagnostic fee and went home.  The next morning her car would not start so she called me over to take a look at it.  After opening the hood I found that the positive battery cable was corroded up and the connector burned through it wasn't making a connection.  I asked myself how could they have missed all the corrosion on the positive battery terminal and not replace the battery cable?   I had to replace the battery cable just to start the car because it was so corroded and burnt through it wasn't making a connection.  After starting the car I discovered that the speedometer doesn't work now.  She returned the car to Marshall's on Monday and they blamed the speedometer not working on the computer and wouldn't even look at it for her.  They apologized for missing the corrosion on the battery cable connection but wouldn't do anything about it.  After repairing the car myself I paid Marshall's a visit and explained the situation to the owner and let him know that I felt that she got very bad customer service and was treated poorly just because she's a woman.  The owner appologized about the mishap and refunded the $125.00 diagnostic fees, provided a free oil change certificate and two movie passes.  He made right by the mishap and applogized again.  I ended up replacing the PCM computer myself for $200.00 and it passed emmissions.  Marshall's is still a very good shop that's honest and trustworthy because the owner made it right by the mishap that transpired with my girlfriends car.  I would still  recommend Marshall's to anyone looking for and honest and reputable auto repair shop in the valley.  I'm not going to let one bad incident change my perception of the shop because the owner went above and beyond what we expected him to do to make this mishap right for her.  We're happy customers now. J.M."
positive,These guys are fabulous! I had to replace a transmission and after 70K miles she's still going strong! They did the work for less than anyone in Vegas quoted me too! Please give them a chance because they are definitely worth it.
positive,"I had a great experience today. The only bummer was picking up the oil filter myself because they ran out. He hooked me up and took 10 dollars off plus discounted the transmission flush and rear diff fluid change. Im glad they recommended checking those items because the fluid was really dirty! I will definitely go back for my next oil change. I would like to give a shoutout to justin whole changed all the fluids, he took the time to show me the how dirty the fluid was and explained how the trans flush works."
positive,"My car won't start and my check engine light is on. So I took it to aamco because they do more than just transmissions, my mom reference, and all the good reviews; also my luck, I live close by. Awesome! so they check, the camshaft sensor was the problem. They fix now My car , 2002 Jeep Liberty, starts right away, but the very important part. Honest service, kyle explained to me the codes meant and what they were going to check, very friendly and patient. I am, like many, young women is hard to deal with cars and mechanics and many don't bother to explain at all, well guess what, we appreciated it. A lot. And best price, around $80 . Oh , and let's not forget they fixed the gear stick, which was loose. I mean ""thank you very much""!"" because not many places take their time to do that for a customer. Thank you for great service."
positive,"This started out much longer then I decided to cut it short and keep to the facts. My 2013 has been a tad bit brutal so on Thanksgiving when check engine light went on I fell further apart. Goodyear whom I have always trusted jumped in to hopefully end 2013 much better than it has been going. Sofia not only handled my major breakdown on the phone well, she handled the business of my car with class and care. With all the other issues going on, I am happy to say they allowed my car not to be another. I am sitting here writing this, crying at the peace of mind that phone call left me in and the kindness in her words. Thank you for your care in customer service, care is how you speak and listen. Care in how you allowed my 2013 to end.
I will never stray again from Goodyear due to a good coupon."
positive,Another great experience at Sun Devil Auto. Every time I take one of my vehicles in they great me with outstanding customer service.  I needed some pretty involved transmission work done and their transmission team did a great job getting my vehicle back to running excellent.  They even helped me with a no interest payment plan that was quick and easy to qualify for.  Thanks for saving another one of my cars Sun Devil.
positive,"Good Care Transmission is great, I can't say enough good things about them.  My wife and I were on our way from Reno to the Grand Canyon in our 2002 Ford F-350 7.3 Diesel pulling a 5th wheel trailer. As we came into Las Vegas the tranny gave out.  I looked at the yelp reviews and where the shop was located and called good care.  Sabrina was great from the start, she told us to come right in and they would take care of us. 
Henry the owner came out and tested our truck right away when we pulled in, he told me what I knew, that the transmission was gone.  I had been towing with this truck for over 1000,000 miles and I knew it would need rebuilding at some point.  Henry offered to put us ahead of other jobs because we were stuck there and he offered to let us stay in our 5th wheel at the shop with a electric cord for power. We ended up limping to a rv park down the street where we stayed for 2 nights while Good Care rebuilt and upgraded our transmission.    It turned out perfect, we finished our trip with a much better upgraded transmission.  And on top of it all they came in under the price they quoted.    Henry is a really quality, honest person of high integrity.    Pay no attention to that one bad review, they explained everything that happened with that and they were not at fault.  You can't go wrong using them."
positive,"I had a great car experience here!... in fact this was the second time I've had a car repaired here and I'd have no qualms about going back to them in the future. 

They went over all the details with me, kept me up to date on the progress and finished ahead of their estimated time. The work involved both body and mechanical repair.  They did a great job of matching new paint to the old on one of the panels....I was impressed that there was no obvious distinction between the two.  We did have to bring it back to have one of the mechanical repairs looked at.. turned out to be a defective part which they replaced with no hassle.

Overall they provided me with friendly and professional service, took care of any concerns I had and did an outstanding job on the repairs."
positive,"Thanks Tim!!!  I went in to this dealership on 12/1/2017 for the first time and it is the ONLY dealership I will go to from now on. From the get go, I had a fantastic experience. Not only did Tim go above and beyond to help me, but it didn't cost me anything! I expected to pay something! I had a check engine light come on in my SONIC which is usually ALWAYS something to worry about; especially when I needed a smog in the near future. Turns out the valve cover needed replacing and it fell under the powertrain warranty. Always good news when it's under warranty! Tim was very knowledgeable and I would definitely give him high marks in customer service. As we all know, good customer service is hard to come by these days. I was also very pleased that the repair did not take very long, so I was able to be on my way to get that smog test!!  Thanks again Tim!!!"
positive,"With so many other car shops giving you a hard time because you're ONLY getting an oil change, Stinky's is a breath of fresh air. The employees are super nice and the quality of work is phenomenal. It is such a great feeling knowing I've found a great spot for an oil change and I also know when my transmission needs a cleaning, I'll for sure come back to Stinky's."
positive,"Ecowash is the best! I took my car in to have a basic wash, and Sherwin noticed I had a huge scrape down the side of my car.  I had stop noticing it a long time ago,  but he asked if he could take care of it for me. Wow! Talk about going the extra mile! He had his ""body guy"" take care of it for me - at no extra charge. Now my car looks as good as new! I couldn't believe how well it turned out. And I love the friendliness of the staff. Chris in the store gave me some great advice on my check engine light. Everyone there is so helpful. I walked away from Ecowash with a huge smile and now that is literally the only place I'll go for my car needs. THANKS ECOWASH!"
positive,"Taking my 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee (3.0 Ltr Diesel) to Canadian Import Auto was the best thing I ever did... and it saved me thousands of dollars. Literally. 

I had previously taken my jeep to the dealership where I bought it - Renfrew Chrysler. My jeep had a persistent oil leak coming from underneath the engine somewhere. After leaving my jeep with Renfrew Chrysler for four days, all they could tell me is they ""thought"" it was an oil pan leak or my rear main seal - quote - $3,500 to pull the motor and repair the rear main seal. 

I left Renfrew Chrysler with ZERO confidence in their ability to help me. 

I then used Facebook to crowd source my network - ""who would you recommend to do mechanical work on a Jeep with the 3.0 Ltr Mercedes Diesel?"" 

Richard and Canadian Import Auto was one of the recommendations by a friend who's mother takes her Mercedes for service. 

I drop off my Jeep and in less then 10 minutes of being up on a hoist, Richard knew exactly where the leak was coming from... and why. 

Richard said he could easily drop the transmission to fix the rear main seal. Renfrew Chrysler said they would have to pull the motor to explore where the leak was coming from... pardon? 

After a closer look, Richard found more leaks, fixed them all. At the same time he checked my glow plugs - they were quite corroded. He replaced those too. 

New seals, air filter, oil filter, oil and transmission fluids, and glow plugs... all in for less than Renfrew's quote. 

On the test drive, Richard heard an unusual noise coming from the engine. Long story short, it was the jeeps turbo. It was faulty and needed to be replaced. Renfrew Chrysler quoted $7000 just for the turbo. Richard made a few calls and found a reconditioned one for $1800. 

Richard and his technicians were nothing but professional and accommodating. His communication throughout the entire service and experience was fantastic and timely. 

I will never service my jeep at Renfrew Chrysler again, nor will I buy from them or refer them. 

I am forever grateful to Richard and his team. I highly recommend."
positive,"I would give them six stars if it was possible. I am new to the neighborhood and have a 14 year old 3/4 ton SUV. It is a 8.1 liter injected engine, so I have been in for a few issues including a transmission overall. 

Suffice to say Troy ""gets it"" I think these are the words I'd use for him - honest, fair, professional, knowledgeable, pro-active, follows up, and easy to talk to!"
positive,"Spectacular customer service. Spectacular honesty. Spectacular work. Great prices.  Allow me to explain: When my Crown Vic P71 tranny ground to a halt in Las Vegas after driving in from L.A.  I had no idea where to take it.  I read the reviews of THIS AAMCO and decided to give it a try.  Fantastic choice! Scott gave me a rather instant diagnosis ( a rebuild) and called me 3 hrs later to give me the full skinny.  The car had thrown a fuel pressure and a fan relay error code and I was telling him to go ahead and fix those problems as well but he cut me off and told me not to worry... he thought they were both erroneous. I got him the car Monday afternoon and told him the sooner they could turn it around  the better as I didn't wan't to run up a big hotel tab.  He said the car would be ready the coming Sat or at the latest on Monday.  As it turned out, they had the car ready to go Friday afternoon. About 3 1/2 work days for a total tranny rebuild. Fast. When I checked up on the car the day before it was done, again I encouraged Scott to think about working on the cooling system as the car did overheat briefly before the tranny died.  He told me he would definitely check it but was sure that the radiator temp spiked only because the transmission cooler lines routed through the radiator and the dying transmission probably overheated the car (he was right as it turned out). There I was marooned in Vegas and the shop knew it (california plates and telephone number) and if they had said to me, oops. we gotta do the radiator and the fuel pressure system because of those error codes I would have had little choice.  Bottom line, the rebuild came in $100 less than the estimate ($1400) and a day early.  I drove the car home at 80 mph and it shifted like new and at just the right shift points (this is a 2008 Police Interceptor) and it ran cool even up the high Baker incline with the A/C on.  The good news is that this shop does all kinds of other repairs, not just trannies.  I'm planning to bring my Vette up there in the next month or two just to have these guys do a bunch of catch up work. I have been to dozens of auto repair shops in 45 years of driving and have never found a place that inspired so much confidence.  You should have no second thoughts.  P.S. If you had told me that I would be praising an AAMCO I would have said you were nuts. But this one and I suppose the others are individually franchised and this one is a total winner."
positive,I have taken my car in twice in the last year for service. The first time the service manager (forgot his name) helped me out and was courteous throughout. It was a transmission problem. Today I just went in for service. Ask for Kate to help you. She is very polite and helpful.
positive,"Had a major problem with my Subaru on the drive from Cali to Vegas.  I limped into the Rio with my car covered in some kind of red oily substance.  Seems I blew my transmission hose, I expected the worst but was treated with respect and the work was very well priced.  Got me back on the road for chump change - could have taken me for a ride.  They do not do work they do not have to do.  Latter I found out I still have a leak from an oil pump but I got home just fine after their help."
positive,Henry is fair he's saved me alot of money on a transmission rebuilds
positive,"Went to Good Care Transmission Shop in August - they had already rebuilt my transmission and I needed some other work done. Unfortunately on my way back from vacation in Sedona, I had to have a part replaced, that should have been replaced when they did my front engine work. When I got back, I went to them with the invoice and they cheerfully refunded me part of my repair bill. Proving that they truly stand behind their work.  Would recommend them to anyone without hesitation."
positive,"I recently had the check engine light come on, on my 2006 Passat out of the blue. I was going to take it to a dealership next to my house in Scottsdale, but after I saw the reviews and bad experiences we have had with almost every business we have come in contact with in Scottsdale, I sought out other options. This is when I ran across this little repair shop. I have to say, I am very happy with the result and am looking forward to coming back soon to gear up my car with some upgrades. 

PS. They took a look at my car and diagnosed the problem for free! All it cost me was 25 bucks for the fuel cap since that is what the issue was. IT would of cost me 100 more at a VW dealership if not more, and chances are they would of screwed something up."
positive,"This is a great shop. Tony and Pete were very helpful. These guys truly care about doing quality work. I went in to have a muffler and resonator delete. Tony gave me a quote (under half of what other shops quoted), walking me through everything that needed to be done. Pete oversaw the work about a week later. Best part is that it didn't take forever and my car sounds GREAT! Would definitely recommend them for any exhaust work you want/need done."
positive,"So, the check engine light comes on Thursday night with my granddaughter in my car.  I get home safely, but what to do on Thursday night?  Call Christian Brothers Friday morning!   I was able to make an appointment online that night, but called the next morning to see if they could look at it earlier.  No problem!  Did I need a ride to work? (No, thank you, I had that arranged).  They were able to look at the car, get the parts and repair it by close of day Saturday.  Not only did I get just about the most courteous service I have ever had, but I got photos of each and every suggested repair/maintenance with an accompanying cost estimate. (It was remarkably accurate).  The pricing was fair.  So far the repairs have been perfect.  Christian Brothers has a customer for life in me.  PS.  They picked me up at home Saturday morning to bring me to the shop to pick up my car(!)"
positive,"I was a little wary about going here because of the negative reviews but every time I drive by this place it's always busy, so it can't be THAT bad, right? 

I initially went in to get a transmission flush. The service is very well priced at $119.99, which is over $100 cheaper than Jiffy Lube...plus they had the car done in less than 20 minutes. The staff inside the oil and lube area was very nice and professional. I was very pleased with this service. I had a similar experience when I brought my car in for an oil change and power steering fluid change. They were professional and took the time to show me that certain things needed to be done. 

When I got my transmission done I went ahead and added a diamond touch wash because my car was disgustingly filthy. They actually did a very good job in a reasonable amount of time, I must say. There were a few missed spots in the interior and I wish they did a better job cleaning the navigation screen but overall I'm really pleased. 

I'm happy they did a good job because this place is literally like 1.5 miles from my house. 

The location also sells shell gasoline but I don't recommend getting it here because it's overpriced. If you want shell gas, go 1 block east and fill up at the Arizona Ave & Germann location. It's a good 20-30¢ cheaper usually."
positive,"Honest mechanics...that's what they are. They didn't try to rip me off when I had a problem that I thought involved my transmission. And they could have easily had told me that was the problem. Instead it was something minor and it didn't cost much to fix. The owners were there in the front office and were very polite and professional. They explained everything to me fully so I could understand. They make you feel welcome and are happy to talk about their family-run business. They're going to do well (or continue doing well) because of their honest ways, and they will absolutely deserve it!"
positive,"I have a Mitsubishi endeavor that is 13 years old and I had the check engine light on and could not pass smog. I dropped the car off to Kevin who I highly recommend. He was working on my car until 11pm. Which is incredible. Every car place I have been to shuts down at 5pm and takes ages to get anything done. 

He texted us updates every few hours on the progress. They are extremely transparent and honest with everything. Which is hard to find. They wont charge you for anything you don't need. They explain everything to you so you don't feel cheated. They even drew me a photo so I could understand everything that was going on. 

Worth every penny!"
positive,"I live over in lone mountain area and I have to drive by two dozen auto shops in order to get here. They are very professional and a good old fashion honest shop with no gimmicks. If it needs to be fix there prices are very reasonable and if it can wait they will let you know. 
 
This is my second time coming to this shop. The first time I was here they work on my transmission to find out what the noise was. Turns out it was just a piece of metal that was stuck in between my transmission bracket and my chaise. No harm was done to my car. Didn't charge me for diagnostic which I really appreciated that. Considering most places in the NW side charge up to $100 just to look at it and not work on it.

I highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking for an honest shop. They have my business."
positive,"Wow Amr and Ritchie are fantastic.  I had sent my 1966 Cadillac Eldorado to the Russo and Steele Auction from Los Angeles.  Just as we were driving it onto the truck we remembered it had a hole in the muffler that we forgot to get fixed so we rang Ritchie. He confirmed he could get the part and to have the trucking company drop the car off to them and he would have it fixed and ready to go by the delivery deadline of Tuesday - True to their word they not only performed the work quickly, they charged a reasonable price and the icing on the cake was Amr offered to organise for it to get the Auction on time by booking a tow for us.  What a find ! I was in Los Angeles so was really doing this blind but hey called with updates, were courtesy and funny on the phone and provided a great Service. Next time I need something done on our cars in Scottsdale I will use these guys without a doubt!"
positive,Been using for years.  They haven't missed a beat with the younger generation running. They do great work and go above and beyond to satisfy their customers.  Recently had my sons car repaired - Honda Civic.  Awesome job as always. Also they repaired some chips on my Acura. Great to deal with. Crazy if you don't consider York Road Automotive for your repairs if you live in the Cle area.
positive,"Came in early on Saturday morning with no wait. Had my car repaired quickly and accurately at literally a quarter of the cost that Meineike quoted. Ulises was a skillful mechanic, and staff at the front desk were helpful.."
positive,"I own a classic 1981 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. It was recently completely restored. The problems began when it started leaking oil from every place possible. I literally spent a small fortune trying to get it repaired to no avail. Everyone who worked on it said it was fixed. It wasn't! I had taken my regular car to Toyo motors for small repairs in the past but never thought they could do the work required on a classic car. I figured, what the heck, I'll ask them if they would look at it. 

I met with Brian and he said to bring it in and they would have a look. After looking it over, they said they could repair it but it would involve pulling the engine out. I asked if they would gaurantee the work and they said they would. I admit, I was skeptical, but I wanted my car to stop leaving a trail of oil all over Phoenix. They called and said it was fixed. I was so happy to have my car back. I drove it home. The next morning I wanted to take my baby out for a drive. As I backed out I noticed a small pool of oil under the car. Not only was it still leaking, it was worse. 

I called Brian at Toyomotors and explained the situation. He said they would stand behind their work and to bring it back. Now the 1981 Pontiac Firebird has the strangest rear main seal in the history of automobiles. It was made of rope and designed by a moron. They have been leaking since forever. Brian and his Toyomotors team have the expertise to fix anything and I am convinced of that now. 

I brought the car back and again they had to pull the engine, only this time they remachined the seal area in order to put in the proper seal. Guess what? It worked. No runs, no drips, no errors. Not a drop of oil leaking from anywhere. Oh yeah, they never charged me a penny more. These guys are great and P would recommend them to anyone. They are honest and knowledgeable auto mechanics who stand behind their work. For any type of auto repair from oil changes to transmissions and everything in between. Toymotors is your one stop shop. They are my heros of auto repair."
positive,"I've been driving my 1982 SD 300 for over 20 years, and most of that time I've had it serviced at German Auto. Eric and the guys in Service are VERY well known to me. They are not pushy and have looked for less expensive options when possible. My good experiences keep me coming back for oil changes and repairs, even though I live miles away. I think they can do most anything, because they have done most everything  on my car, except for the engine and transmission, which are still Mercedes strong after more than 400K miles. Call and talk to Eric before you go. He is honest and will explore options. I'm picking up my car there today after its latest round of work. I don't like spending money on my car, but when I do, I know these guys will give me value."
positive,"Great shop. Took my car in because of a check engine light, and they were able to diagnose it, fix it, and replace the oil for under $200."
positive,"Thank you to Justin and Jamie!!  I was having an awful time getting my insurance company to listen to my concerns and help me get my car repaired in a timely manner, and they both stepped in and took absolute control of the situation in a very professional manner to make sure I was comfortable and be well informed throughout the entire process.  I hope I do not require their services any time soon, however, they will be the first I call and tell all my friends about in a time of need!"
positive,"I am not one who takes the time to write a review however Matt & the guys at Bison Automotive ARE HONEST TRUSTWORTHY AND DEPENDABLE and will FOREVER (or at least as long as I live within driving distance to his shop) be my mechanic!!!!

My family moved here from Utah just over 6 years ago where I worked with a mechanic in the family to fix all our cars. When we moved to Arizona it was hard to find a mechanic who would listen and wouldn't try to repair things that I knew didn't need repair. We all know how hard it is to find a trustworthy and good mechanic let alone a GREAT one. I have lived in Buckeye for over 3 years and the guys on Matts crew are EXACTLY WHAT BUCKEYE NEEDS a good and trusted shop we can count on WHEN (not if) our babies konk out.
My Volvo is my BABY and I treat it that way so when her transmission was having issues I took her to the dealership (JOKE) & to a ""friend"" both wanted to charge me nearly $3000.00 the dealership $150.00 just to plug it in NOT!! 
Thanks to YELP I found Bison Automotive. I can not tell you how REFRESHING it is to talk to a mechanic who actually listens and doesn't discount any diagnosis made by someone other than themselves, one who lives the GOLDEN RULE
Matt and his crew not only beat the previous bids but he had it in and out of the shop in 3 days and it would have been less if he wasn't forced to wait for parts from Volvo that were a day and a half later that promised. Matt is working on a new shop I hope he finds one close but if not WE WILL DRIVE TO WHERE EVER HE GOES!!!!!  THANK YOU GUYS!!!!!"
positive,"The service was VERY friendly. I'm a woman So I always feel like im getting screwed over anyways but this was pretty good. Got oil change, brake and transmission fluids and a few other services and it was about $270 bucks. Mind you the truck hadn't has ANY service in 2 years so it probably needed it. The waiting area is very nice and they also give Military Discount :)"
positive,"I had the unfortunate experience of having my ford expedition's transmission start to fail just outside of Primm while my family, two dogs and a 6x12' u-haul trailer were being transported on our way to Utah.  After reading both the yelp and google reviews, I decided to attempt to nurse it along to this AAMCO and was extremely happy I did. The service is excellent, and they even stored my trailer behind locked fences while doing a complete transmission rebuild.  Their pricing was very competitive and they could have easily taken advantage of my situation and didn't.  I really appreciated the friendliness and honestly of the mechanics and the family the runs this place are some good people. Initially, I wasn't sure if the google reviews were real or manufactured because they were so positive for an AAMCO location but after having my transmission rebuilt here, I understand why and can personally vouch of the excellence of this location.   If I ever find myself in the need of any car work while driving through Las Vegas again, this will be the place I go to without hesitation."
positive,"Very honest people to deal with. Arrived in LV from LA and our Civic's transmission started acting up. Took it the next day to AAMCO and they looked at it immediately, told us it was a stuck solenoid and that during the test drive it unstuck. They did not charge us. They did not  take advantage of out of towners. Met a lady waiting for her car. She has taken her car to these guys before. She says they are the best, honest and very fair in price plus they do excellent work. Wouldn't hessitate to have these guys work on our car."
positive,"Mark did a great job tending to my Jeep transmission issue I can always depend on Honest One they live up to their name. I got in a real bind and couldn't get a rental due to traveling they got me a car. They are over the top when it comes to customer service. The only bad thing is it's no secret, they are a busy shop because they are good and everyone knows it."
positive,"Wish I could give this place a higher rating! They are Wonderful! Honest, respectful, hard-working - old-fashioned values that you just don't find anymore. Took our Dodge in yesterday because my husband heard some noises and thought it was running rough. Of Course the car didn't act that way for the mechanics! Lol! They had the car for the day, road-tested it several times, checked it out thoroughly, and didn't find anything. Last time that happened, we were told (by Another place) that we needed a new alternator - which didn't fix the issue of course (it ended up being the transmission that time :-( The ""other place"" told us oh well, it needed an alternator anyway. Um...no!) So Sunland Could have told us the car needed a tune-up or Something - and we probably would have gone for it. I mean, you're kinda at a disadvantage when it comes to things you know nothing about, right? But instead, Scott said he just couldn't find anything wrong. When I asked what I owed - hey, time is money and I was figuring on at Least a diagnostic fee - he said ""nothing"" and shook my hand! I was floored! We will be back - we go to Sunland for all our auto repairs because we know they will treat us right. Thanks Scott and Tom! You have restored our faith in mechanics and mankind! :-)"
positive,"Wow! I've always been so thrown off by many mechanic shops (such as common), but CMD totally went above and beyond in great customer service and mechanic work for my first visit! They weren't out to take advantage of the customer and their money, these folks are sincere and honest in their work. One quote for a certain part was too high then CMD worked with me in finding the perfect value part fit for my car's needs. Getting the job done was seamless. Dropped off the car on day 1 for the diagnostic and dropped off the car again on day 3 when the part arrived for them to perform the job. Just like that, my car was the happiest with a healed check engine light for a great price. I recommend everyone to give this shop a try! My neighbors recommended it to me and I'm so thankful to follow up on that! I will for sure come back for the next car service!"
positive,"I own two Toyota trucks.  3 years ago my manual transmission went out on my 1986 4 by 4 and Billy found a rebuilt transmission and installed it in literally 48 hours from my first phone call to finished job. He somehow got it from California next day. My automatic transmission rear seal went out on my 1988 work-truck last year and I was an idiot for not quickly addressing the problem. It ended up slopping the rear transmission housing and this part was impossible to find anywhere. It took him a couple days but he had my truck back to me by honing out the part and having a bushing manually fabricated and installed. I won't mention price, but I will say this....... both jobs totally saved my butt and both trucks run like new, and I was extremely happy with the price of each of the two jobs. Billy is an honest guy who won't take advantage of you and he gets the job done right the first time. Since it is well through the ""trial period"" and both trucks run perfect, and both jobs were not easy fixes, I feel it is my obligation to take a minute and write a review for this company as my way of saying thanks."
positive,"I was on vacation in Pittsburgh and had a muffler problem. Penn Automotive took a look, told me what I needed, but was unable to fix it that day due to scheduled customers. They also told me it was safe to drive, just loud and annoying. They didn't charge anything. I told them I couldn't give them repeat business since I was from out of town, but would surely give them a good review. If I did live in in the area I would be a regular customer. Thanks again"
positive,"by far the best quality and service transmission repair facility in las vegas. Billy is the most knowledgable tranny guy I have seen in my 30 years in the automotive business. I have been in Vegas for 11 years and Billy has been doing transmissions for me the whole time. In that time I have never had a single problem with any of over 25 transmissions he has done. Billy and Tom are friendly, courteous, and accommodating. The quality and service are second to none. What more can one ask for."
positive,"The service is great and the price is great. Check out the reviews on google and there 5 out of 5 which is impossible for a transmission shop to do. They provide warrantees on work, and do the job right, and they meet the deadlines. And the reality is, you can't find a cheaper price for the quality of work they do."
positive,The best of the best.  They have earned my trust through the many times I've had my car repaired and maintained there.   And I really like the folks who work there.   I highly recommend Carlife!
positive,"I was not really looking for another car. I have a 2016 Buick Regal Base & a 2015 Buick Lacrosse Hybrid that I make payments on. That's when it hit me... I have 2 cars, that I don't really own & I won't own them until I pay them off in 7 years. So I decided that I needed to own something, anything decent & cheap just to survive if I had to without my other 2 cars with the payments. I was browsing around cars.com and I saw this 2003 Buick LeSabre with 69k miles on it for less than 6k. At first I thought, why is it on a Volvo lot? I was also wondering what was wrong with this car too, as it was way under mileage for it's age and only 6k roughly. I made an appointment to go see this LeSabre. My point of contact was Marcus Rice. This guy is taller than me, and I'm 6'4. He should have been playing basket ball, not selling used cars. Marcus had the car out in front of the dealership on Saturday afternoon for our appointment. I was told that there was another appointment for the Buick LeSabre at 1pm, and thought this was a ""sales trick"". I met the General Manager Lane himself and he confirmed that there was indeed another appointment for the car, and that they hadn't shown up yet anyway. Lane also said ""because you were first to inquire about the car, you have first shot at buying it"". This proved that this dealership and Marcus are very truthful and professional about how they handle cars and appointments. I felt like I was really cared about even though I was potentially going to buy a 6k Buick LeSabre and not a 45k new Volvo. Marcus and I inspected the car, inside and outside. We then took the car around the block for a test drive. The car performed like any Buick would during that time: Smooth and seamless transmission shifts, and it felt like it was riding on an air suspension, even though it wasn't. After the test drive, I wanted to know a little more about the car, and Marcus allowed me to take as much time as possible to try and get to know this Buick that potentially was going to go home with me. It made a strange noise from inside the cabin, and I was obsessed with finding out what the noise was, so me and Marcus searched the car inside & out without damaging it, to realize that the main battery is under the back seat, and that was the source of the noise. It was only for a few seconds during startup, and it was just unusual. The car was clean, inside and out. No tears in the leather upholstery, not a rip, tear, no weird smells, all of the dated controls worked seamlessly, for the vehicle's age. The outside didn't have any dents, or anything that might have indicated body work in the past. I asked Marcus, ""Why is this car here"" and he said ""we don't normally keep cars this old on our lot unless they are in almost pristine condition"". I winded up asking Marcus to sell me the car, because his service, help and the condition of the car made say, ""do it, buy this car, because you'll own it, and even though it's 14 years old, it's nice enough to do Real Estate in"". I pulled the trigger and bought the car. The service didn't stop there though. Marcus was kind enough to wash my 2015 Lacrosse while I was in the office with Gary the finance guy, and he didn't try to upsell me anything I didn't really need for this car. He said he would have bought this car for himself if I didn't buy it for road trips to California. I understand why as a Buick / GM man myself. Volvo of Las Vegas even picked up the bill for touching up the little dings & scratches that were on the vehicle. All I paid for was the window tint, the car itself, taxes, & doc fees for the dealership including NV title. They didn't have to pay for the touch up, & reconditioning, they really didn't. I picked up the car this afternoon, a week after I bought it, because this was the only day I had free this week between my RE business and job. The car looks and feels brand new. Marcus had the car out front again, washed, with keys in hand when I came to get it. Marcus over delivered on his service, just like Gary the finance guy over delivered on his service, and their service to me, even though I bought a 6k GM car and not a 45k Volvo is a tribute to their dedication to professionalism, and service to all clients. I wasn't thinking about a Volvo, but who knows, I might be back for one! Again, thank you Marcus Rice, Gary & General Manger Lane for a wonderful buying experience for the car I wanted & needed at this stage in my life!"
positive,"I had taken my wife's Mercedes suv to another mechanic recently because her check engine light came on right before she was going to take it to get a smoke check.  At the first shop they ran the diagnostics to check the code and found that it had something to do with the mass air flow sensor malfunctioning.  They said instead of replacing the maf sensor that I should opt for the 65k miles tune up which includes an engine flush that would clear the problem and would be less expensive than the maf sensor.  This sounded good to me so I agreed, a few days after spending $250 for the tune up the check engine light came back on. I brought it back and they said they found a loose wire that is most likely the problem, they proceeded to replace/repair the wire (another $100).  The very same evening the check engine light came on again. Needless to say at this point I was very disappointed and frustrated.  The owner of the shop finally inspected the vehicle and deemed that the maf sensor needs to be replaced and the sensor including labor would cost an additional $350. I promptly told him ""no thank you.""  I than remembered that James (the owner of Sin City Garage) who had serviced  my other Mercedes when he worked at the local Mercedes dealership had opened his own shop.  I brought the suv to his shop and he ran a diagnostic and confirmed it was the maf sensor.  He also mentioned that my wife's suv did not need the 65k miles tune-up that it would need one to at least 100k miles.  I gave him the go ahead to replace the maf sensor, which ended up costing less than the 65k mile tune-up and to this day the check engine light has not re-appeared.  I have since referred all of my friends to him.  I am so glad that I have finally found an ""honest mechanic"" (not an oxymoron) in this town!"
positive,"I came here once to fix my transmission and these guys are great! For once, an auto shop that didn't try to rip me off which was a relief. They're very fair with their prices here, and they do a quick and nice job. My transmission had a hole in it and it was fixed within a day."
positive,"After Sunday lunch with my family,  my mini van decided it didn't want to shift anymore.  I was able to get under the car and see the shift cable was off the transmission, but I couldn't reach it to do anything. Monday morning I called a garage that we've used in the past,  but they wouldn't give me an estimate and wanted me to pay to have the car towed,  keep it for a day and THEN tell me how much it was going to cost.  Instead of that bull crap,  I took to yelp to find a mobile mechanic to come and do the job.  I found Carter on yelp.  He had good reviews,  and it was easy to request a quote from him thru the app. He got back to me quickly with an estimate and picked up the part  and met me at In&Out where I had broken down.  In less than 3 hours from contacting him,  he replaced the cable and had me back on my way.  His prices were very reasonable,  especially considering I didn't have to pay to tow my vehicle anywhere.  I really liked he told me up front how much it would cost so there were no surprises.  He was honest and fair.  I would recommend him to anyone and will use him in the future."
positive,"I emailed asking for a quote on transmission fluid flush, was emailed back promptly detailing the cost and procedure. Showed up next morning and was done very quickly.  The waiting area is pretty awesome. Pricing was competitive. Will definitely return."
positive,Very polite staff and very honest mechanics. My transmission light came on and at that point I could of been told it was anything. It was just a sensor and I was so glad to know I found an honest BMW shop ! Don't hesitate to bring your car when service is needed !
positive,"3 years and 37,000 miles later, transmission holding strong!! .. So I had Scott's crew rebuild my transmission in Nov 2013.  It's a FWD GM trans. and since the rebuild I've moved across the country and put 37,000 miles on it.  Still runs great and feels like new!!! Wish I had a shop like this one where I live now."
positive,"BEST CAR RENTAL PLACE EVER!
My husband and I were driving down from Washington state to Phoenix,  when my transmission went out about 2 hours out of Phoenix. 
Walked in and was out of there within a few minutes.  Rented the car for 4 days but decided to keep it another 3. Called them up and explained we needed 3 more days on the rental, which they said the last 2 days were free because if you rent for 5 days, you get 2 days free. 
Their cars are supposed to be ""Smoke Free"", to which someone before me had smoked in. When I checked the car back in, I said something to them about this. The manager in there was so kind that he credited me 20% off the ENTIRE RENTAL.
So I just didn't get 2 days FREE, I also got an additional 20% off the 5 days I paid for. 
I have never had a car rental company go above and beyond for me.
 THEY CARED THAT I WAS SATISFIED WITH THEIR SERVICES 

     I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION:

     555 W. Ball Rd
       Phoenix,  Az
    602-439-6818"
positive,"Was looking for someone to work on my vehicle (a check engine light had appeared) and I had become somewhat disgruntled with my old service center. After looking on Yelp reviews, I decided to call Marshall's. They were able to get it in the next day to see what the problem was.  Very nice on the telephone, and they called me back to give me various options and prices on repairs. I decided to just replace the spark plug wires, and when I picked it up, it ran perfectly.

What impressed me was they gave me choices on what needed fixing immediately, and what could wait until later.  Some of the things that needed to be done, I could do myself which saved  money, which is always a good thing. 

Very nice people, and very professional. They are my new auto service mechanics, as I can trust them to give me honest answers."
positive,"A real diamond in the rough! I have to admit that I am very impressed with Pro Transmissions and its owner Al.

Anybody that goes to have their transmission looked at because of a problem is always VERY weary of mechanics, because hey, most of us don't know that much about cars, and we sure don't know how much repairs should cost.

Al makes you feel very comfortable and tells you the way it is. 

They spent a few hours checking over everything and gave me the best deal they could, which was about 14% lower than another shop had quoted me a week earlier.

My transmission purrs like a kitten now and I am very happy. You are in good hands with these guys!"
positive,"This place was recommended to me by a few coworkers. Came in here with a chirp and check engine light that's been bothering me for a few weeks. They got me in on short notice, did a FREE diagnosis, and fixed my car in 4 hours. The receptionist Aiko (spelling?) was very informative, quick with answers, and friendly. She definitely made the process quick and easy."
positive,"THIS GOOD YEAR REALLY PULLED THROUGH FOR ME TODAY!! Today I was having an extremely terrible day cause the Good Year i was a loyal customer to let me down. I had invested a lot of money into the previous location I was at. This location that I tried today on Losee seemed very honest & incredibly helpful. The previous Good Year I was a customer at was going to charge me $3,200 dollars to replace my whole transmission but when I went to this location today I only paid $283 & only had to change the fluid. This is where I'll be taking my car from now on. I feel that this location definitely lives up to GOOD YEARS name & doesn't seem greedy with wanting to take customers money like the last location. Special Thanks to Rick the manager for his phenomenal customer service & help."
positive,"They have won a customer for life! I had no problem making an appointment. Went in as a single woman for a transmission problem.  The bill was 1/3 of what I would have been charged at a Jiffy Lube PLUS they repaired a ""check engine light"" problem for FREE. (It was a small cracked hose on my smog system) Kind, Honest and FAIR on their pricing."
positive,"Came for a check engine light check. Left with a new battery. Zoren took care and helped get me running again! 
The prices are a bit high but sometimes they have coupons or offers online. 
We've been shopping here for years and no real disappointments. From oil and filters to batteries and wiper blades, they carry good products and if they don't have it currently on hand they'll get another store to ship it to them so you can get it in the next day or two."
positive,My car was not shifting right and revving when speeding up. I took it in because I knew it had to be the transmission. I dropped off my car and awhile later I get a call from them. They told me my transmission was perfectly fine. They diagnosed my car with a clogged catalytic converter. They recommended I take it into a muffler shop. I found Triple A Muffler in Henderson and they confirmed it was SEVERELY plugged. It's hard to find an honest mechanic these days. AAMCO was honest and correctly diagnosed my car. They didn't charge me. If I ever have a transmission problem in the future I would see them. I would recommend them to my family and friends!
positive,"I've been to 1st Class Auto 2 times. Both times they were much cheaper than other shops. Ray is very knowledgeable and I felt very comfortable with the diagnosis.  After one time my car's check engine light came on and we went back. He said loosen the gas cap, wait a couple of days and it will be fine and it was true! They didn't charge for work not needed. They are my go to auto repair shop!"
positive,Last October the transmission in my 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 failed. I brought it in and had a complete rebuild. After a few weeks the transmission stopped shifting into Overdrive. I brought it back to the shop and it turned into the project from hell for them. They spent days researching and rebuilding until they finally found and fixed the problem. The best and most amazing thing was they stood behind the rebuild guarantee  100%. There was no additional charge!  This is one of the best business experiences o have ever had in my life. If you need a transmission shop this is your place!
positive,"This place is awesome! I brought my car here for a check engine light and Kawika went over the diagnostics with me and suggested the cheapest things we could try first, like replacing the gas cap. He reset the check engine light and did the diagnostics at no charge, took about 30 min. I replaced the gas cap and the light hasn't been back since. But I know where I will take my cars for any kind of issues in the future. Total honest place to take your vehicle. I took my car somewhere else before I came here and they quoted me over a $1000 and didn't even explain anything and charged a $100 for the diagnostic and didn't even clear the engine light. If you want and honest mechanic, come here! Make an appointment. Thanks again Kawika!"
positive,"More and more airports are adopting the off site car rental center that, in my opinion, is the best concept since sliced bread.  It frees up much needed room at the airport for their main operations serving the passengers and guests.  McCarran is no exception.  

The major rental companies reside on the main floor while the cheaper Fox rental cars are located in the lower level.  The Fox rental cars are definitely the cheapest cars you can get for less than $10 a day but you get the most basic car with manual locks, no alarm, roll up windows but thankfully automatic transmission and some A/C.  If you can stand not having those conveniences, then try Fox out.  If not, Thrifty and Enterprise have been good for me!  Enjoy the convenience as there is one less thing to work about on your travels!"
positive,"Again, there's a reason the Neighborhood Garage has ALL 5 star reviews. I will NEVER go anywhere else to have my car serviced. EVER.

Got my POS Honda back from Andy (the owner) yesterday! After finding several OBD code reads, he quickly and successfully diagnosed a bad Multiplex Control Unit (electrical issue). He didn't gouge me on the part and the labor price was fair. 

BUT, the kicker is....the check engine light was off when it should have been on (OBD was still reading codes even though light wasn't on). Part of the repair quote included replacement of the bulb (not cheap due to location). When the new Multiplex Control Unit was installed, the check engine light worked as it should without need for replacement. Andy could have charged me for the replacement of the bulb and I'd have never known the difference. But he didn't. He was honest and saved me a pretty penny...a penny I need right now.

I can't thank Andy enough for his kindness, honesty and skill. He is THE shining light in today's world of sketchy business."
positive,Needed to get my car smogged but check engine light was on. These guys were able to find the problem and get it fixed right at a reasonable price. Thanks guys.
positive,"I have only been shocked by amazing customer service at a repair shop one other time in my life, and that was in 1996. Usually when I deal with car repair issues the defenses go up and stay there.
The staff at Marshall's has done the impossible- change my mind and prove to me that even though a good shop usually has a full schedule and charges a good chunk of money just to open your hood, there are exceptions and occasionally someone commits a random act of generosity that makes your day.
How many people really walk away from a shop, after their new to them car has broken down and been towed, with a smile on their faces? It wasn't my car, it was a friend's, but it was so nice to deal with a business that told the truth, even when it didn't make a profit!
We were 35 miles away from home when my friends just over 100,000 mile car, that he'd bought less than a month ago, lost most of it's accelerating power while getting on the 101. We were fairly alarmed and got off the road to check it out. There was not anything that we could see causing the problem and neither of us wanted to be involved in one of those stories that start with- ""The car was still moving so I drove it"", and end with ""if I had just had it towed I wouldn't be shelling out a couple thousand bucks to replace the entire transmission."" 
The car was towed there at about 3pm and the error code was pointing towards a really expensive tranny repair. 
We were bummed, no ride available for at least a few hours, and who has extra money for a car problem, especially after just buying a vehicle?
They said they'd get it in and check some stuff out that afternoon, which was great. Even greater? The mechanic came back and told us that he couldn't find anything wrong- he had driven it to make sure. He had called the transmission shop that he uses when he can't  diagnose a complicated problem, and the the error code was one that printed off 4 pages of things to rule out before it would be possible to guess what the actual problem was well enough to fix it. 
They said that they would be more than happy to keep the car overnight, send it to the other shop for more diagnostics, and then to bring it back and fix it. Then- something rarely heard in a business that wants to make a profit. There was nothing going on that would prevent the car from making it home, and that it might be more convenient and a whole lot easier to take it back to Glendale and go to the transmission shop that he had been given the name of. 
That was so cool, but even cooler to hear- No charge! The prices are clearly listed on the wall behind the counter, and it was $120 just to hook it up and read the code #. They had done that, driven it, called some people that knew more than they did, and then just passed on the info at absolutely no charge. I think we were out of there by 4:30. 
I will be purchasing a car soon, and a good shop, with honest staff who don't have a problem consulting another business when it gets more complicated than they feel comfortable with, and who actually cares about the customers enough to just make  sure the car isn't really broken is exactly what I want. Now that I know that one exists, I will make every reasonable effort to get my vehicles there for maintenance, scheduled repairs, and, with a decent AAA membership, unscheduled and highly stressful breakdowns. 
I did not know that people still did business this way. They must be doing a lot of good repairs to be able to give completely honest advice that doesn't make them a cent. 
There was a vehicle on every lift being fixed, so it wasn't a slow day. This didn't happen because they had nothing better to do. Apparently it's just the way they run the business.
Thanks guys! The car is home and the customer is very pleased."
positive,"I'm always a little skeptical taking my car to get work done, seeing as I am a girl who doesn't know squat about vehicles, but Ray did not make me feel uncomfortable at all. He was patient with me, informative and helpful. 

I've taken my car in on two occasions now - the first was to correct some alignment issues (for the low price of $62.. so cheap!) and the second was to figure out why my check engine light was on. Turned out I just needed a new gas cap which was also a quick, inexpensive fix. 

I would definitely feel comfortable taking my car to First Class Auto for any future problems, and recommend to others."
positive,"Surprisingly good little location for quick oil changes. I had a coupon for $20 off an oil change and when I got their, they gave me the $20 off without me even mentioning it. The individual working on my car asked me to come take a look at my transmission fluid, which turned out to be more grey than pink. I'm always apprehensive when a quick service place tries to upsell me but the agent didn't have any issue when I asked him to re-dip the dip stick; his assessment was bang on. When I went to pay, he gave me another $30 off and told me they were having a promotion that I wasn't aware of; its always good when you get to pay less and their base prices for their services are pretty much the same as other similar quick service locations. Don't let the forest lawn location fool you, they do good work and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly."
positive,"My Honda Odyssey was on the last few miles on its transmission life. I was really thinking about driving it to the salvage yard since the cost of repair is the same as the value of the car. I had a second thought because this minivan has 126,000 miles and I just replaced four tires, time belt, starter and other stuff, so I looked up on Yelp and found Good Care Transmission. This place did a wonderful job in rebuilding my transmission. OMG! My minivan runs like a new car. Sabrina gave us a fair price and gave us updates on the repair progress. Her shop still had 3 cars they had to work on before us, so I was not expecting to have the minivan fixed right away. Sabrina found other problems and fixed them for a small cost. It took almost 4 weeks to fix everything just in time for the registration of the car. Sabrina told us to drive the car first before smog check and we did. We also followed the different driving conditions to have the codes ready for smog test. The car easily passed. Thank you Good Care Transmission. More power to you!"
positive,"A few weeks ago, I noticed the check engine light on in my car. After a $100 diagnostic test at the dealership, I was quoted over $1200 (on a 2009 Hyundai Elantra) to have both O2 censors replaced and the spark plugs done. Knowing that that was an outrageous price, I decided to call around and see what I could find.

The folks over at Pep Boys were immediately able and willing to help with my problem. The gentleman that gave me my quote (Brandon) stayed after his store closed just to speak to me on the phone, letting me know the breakdown of the costs/product options/service time estimate. After discerning that Pep Boys was by far the most affordable option, I took my car in to have these few things done. Since I will be going back to school this fall, they allowed me to present my acceptance letter for their student discount, which meant that I was able to have the work my car needed done for under HALF of what the dealership wanted to charge me! 

The best part is that with Pep Boys, I know I'm not compromising on quality. I know that even after I move, I'll be able to find a branch in my new state that I can depend on for car-care and maintenance. It's been about a month since I've had the work done on my car, and I've had absolutely no problems since they serviced it. Thanks, Pep Boys for treating me with respect, honesty and kindness when I needed your help. I'll be back!"
positive,"Chris F was my service advisor. I brought my 2008 Civic in for an oil change and transmission fluid change. This was my first time to Superstition Honda and I was very pleased. I also took advantage of the complimentary wash and that was even better than when I've had it done at a different dealership.  Also Chris made me aware that I needed both a fuel filter and a cabin filter, but not pushy.  I will be coming back to Superstition Honda whenever I need work done. Thank you!"
positive,"I needed to have my car repaired because the check engine light was on and I'm due to emissions and registration.  

Carter is the one who deals with the calls, the work, everything.   He came out with a truck to my condo and worked on my car right then and there.  He is very professional and friendly.  He is honest and explains things regarding the car, without just fixing things or diddling with things and then giving you a bill.  His prices are extremely reasonable and it is obvious that he enjoys what he does and genuinely wants to help people with their car problems and help them understand what's going on for future reference.

I would highly recommend him.  He was honest, reasonable in price (cheap!), and educational."
positive,"I went to cobblestone auto spa on alma school and germane,  I believe it was justin that wrote me up but he really gave me all that i needed and didnt try to up sell me on anything. Got my transmission surviced and an oil change and i couldnt be happier.  Car is shifting a lot smoother now.  They worked really fast to get my car done as well because i told them i had somewhere to be.  Great experience. Im definitely going back"
positive,"My check engine light came on and I panicked! I assumed it was because of low oil so I topped it off and came in. Immediately I was helped by two great guys who checked all the specs. After adding the oil they said I would be fine but to come in about a week to see if there is a leak. I'm so thankful that these wonderful guys helped me! I'll be coming back in to get everything checked out again in a week. Very nice gents, even gave me a flower."
positive,"Marcus Berg is a great lawyer! I had gotten into an accident and he had taken all my worries away by being so helpful and aggressive. He got my car repaired and my settlement quickly, couldn't have had a better attorney than him! Thank you Marcus!"
positive,"What a breath of fresh air to find a good mechanic.  I went for a routine maintenance on my Subaru as well as a check up for a transmission issue.  The staff was quick and friendly.  Originally quoted to take 2-3 hours and was completed in just over 1 hour.  They could have quoted me for a new transmission but they were honest and told me the issue is currently not too bad.  
The work done was quality and honest.  I will be coming back here for many services to come."
positive,"After searching and searching for an auto repair shop that was open past 5:00pm in my area and being turned down by a couple of shops I was about to give hope but then I came across Anyplace Auto Repair and left a voice mail seeing if it was possible to have my check engine light looked at as I had registration and emissions due in a few days. Carter called me back within 10 minutes and talked to me for about 5 min about what the problem could be. It was already later in the day but he said he could stop by on his way home and take a look at it. He got there, fixed the problem in 30 minutes and my check engine light hasn't come on since! I passed emissions with flying colors and saved a lot of time and a TON of money compared to all the other crooks that call themselves auto repair shops. Would highly recommend to any friend or family member! Thanks Carter!!"
positive,"I was researching foreign auto mechanics in my area and came across Honest-1 in my neighborhood. The Mercedes dealership had given me an estimate of 2 grand and days w/o a car. I called Honest on a Friday morning, brought it in and had it back by 3pm that afternoon. Not only did they do a great job, stopped the leaking and profuse smoking, the price was well under a grand. That was a blessing as my husband had been out of  work for 2 months and I had just paid my rent. My check engine light came on during the weekend, brought it in that Monday. They fixed it in 10 minutes and still made it to work on time. They live up to their name! Great to have them in the neighborhood. They will be my mechanic from now on!  Need mechanics that know what they're doing that you can trust? Look no further."
positive,Been to this Pep Boys many times and have always had excellent service. Brought it in today for a TCS and check engine light. Diagnostic showed something wrong with the transmission which they unfortunately don't do but they recommended a local transmission shop and Greg waived their diagnostic fee which we really appreciate since transmission fixes aren't usually cheap. Definitely recommend this Pep Boys!
positive,"Kenny and Frank are THE BEST. Only repairs what needs to be done. Over the years had timing belt, brakes, rack and pinion replaced. Cheaper than Honda and another mechanic I USE to use. Told me I could get over 200,000 miles on my car with regular upkeep. I'm at 110,000. Regular oil changes, rotate tires. I am HAPPY!"
positive,"I will agree with most of the other reviews.  Took my Mini in for a check engine light.  John greeted me, and promptly checked out the car.  It needs work, but he did not pressure me, was informative, and gave me a written estimate.  Unlike most shops in town, including the Mini dealership, SW Bimmers will diagnose without charge, which used to be the standard in America.   I feel I can trust this shop, which is hard to come by when it comes to auto repair anywhere.  Since my problem is not urgent, I will most likely have this shop do the work.  This was a rare pleasant experience, despite the work I need done."
positive,"Five friends and I planned a trip to Vegas just for the hell of it and ended up deciding on Vdara to try out a 2 bedroom suite.  We were on the 54th floor of this amazing hotel and couldn't have asked for more! Well, I guess we could've.  

The blackout and shades on the windows weren't working properly, the engineer had told us they were all tangled up, but they came and fixed them while we were gone.  They were very quick to fix or replace things when we called and the staff was always very nice.  The rooms were pretty nicely sized and their bathrooms were very nice, but didn't have the bathtubs I was expecting and only had a bathtub in 1 restroom.  Also, the shower head in our restroom didn't have something to hold the head in shower position, instead we had to hold it and didn't realize there was a piece missing until the day we left.  The light in our closet was acting up, didn't turn on when it was supposed to, but stayed on when we closed the door and were trying to sleep.  The safe seemed a little small.  There was a resort fee of $100 a day (Yikes!!) that they hadn't mentioned on the many occasions that my friend called to confirm all of the charges.  The hotel is also valet only, which has it's pros and cons, and with a car like ours with a transmission problem I would have rather self parked it, but they took good direction and we got our car back every time with no issues or dings.  

The suite was very clean and the decor was gorgeous,  the view was exquisite, the beds were soft and comfortable but they were only queen sized beds,  their customer service was awesome, and besides the small easily fixed items I described above, I had an awesome suite experience! So if you don't mind staying in a hotel with no casino, Vdara is the way to go, their prices are pretty reasonable, the hotel itself is easy to get to from every point on the strip and it's just a very nice hotel."
positive,"My wife's Mazda MPV minivan had some rough idling which got worse over a course of a week and then the dreaded check engine light came on. Though it was just the gas cap not tight enough. The RPMs are getting worse each day and decided to go to one of the Japanese car specialty repair shops but was told they were busy and won't be able to my wife's minivan until lunchtime and I was already there upon opening at 8am. Called Yoshi and was told to come to his shop at 10am and will take a look asap. Upon presenting him the codes that were pulled up for free at Autozone, he immediately proceeded to check the PCV hose and found that it was already almost melted and tried to remove the other part of it but since the space on the engine is narrow, he needed to take out the air intake flow hose and immediately called someone to order an OEM Mazda PCV hose since he is not able to replicate the hose due to different sizes from either ends of it. The PCV hose was delivered after about an hour or two then proceeded to replace it and showed me that the other end or part of the hose has a nickel sized hole in it and was creating a leak and affecting the O2 sensors in the process. Now the minivan drives just like almost brand new. The price I paid was very very reasonable and was expecting to pay so much more. It is a very good feeling to know that there are mechanics out there that have the passion for their profession and not out to rip people's wallets off just because they can. Will be coming in here from now on and at last found a mechanic I can trust."
positive,"I am a repeat customer at Tempe Honda because Missy Frietz is just such a pleasure to work with. She not only met my expectations but went above and beyond to make sure that I was taken care of throughout my car buying experience. 

I was looking to lease/buy a 2018 Honda Civic Hatchback Sport w Manual Transmission, however the manual transmissions are rare and hard to find. Missy was able to locate one for me but it was in another city. She really impressed me by going out of the way to pick up the vehicle I wanted in Surprise AZ and brought it to Tempe Honda. If that doesn't show that she goes above and beyond to make the customer happy I don't know what will. 

The car leasing process was smooth and hassle free. She gave me an amazing deal, no haggling, no BS. She was always there to answer my questions and to help me get the best deal. 

When the time comes for a new vehicle, I am definitely going back to Tempe Honda because Missy delivers time and time again."
positive,"Read the perfect scores, this place is no joke.  I had my 2003 BMW Trans (ZF 5HP24) rebuilt here.  

In summary, no matter how you cut it, there was no possible way to have it done at a better price, with professional courteous service and best of all, a warranty.  I got one heck of a deal on a quality rebuild backed by a national name.  Even had I bought a junkyard transmission, and paid for a drop in the pricing would've been close to what I paid for a fully rebuilt, guaranteed transmission.  Anything goes wrong?  No hassles.

You won't be disappointed in the service, pricing or quality.  I'm astonished, frankly-  never seen a scenario where it was actually CHEAPER to have them do it then to try to swap it myself- until now.

Best decision I ever made was to come to this shop for trans work.  Thanks to everyone at AAMCO."
positive,"If you are looking for a good, honest and trustworthy mechanic, then you are sure to find one at Sunland. We found this garage through www.narpro.com (the Neighborhood Auto Repair Professionals Network) which in and of itself guarantees a straighforward, up-and-up business. However after several interactions with the professionals here, we give our seal of approval.

First of all, at Sunland, they don't treat you like a dummy just because you are a woman. They take the time to explain things in simple enough terms for you to understand. They are honest about what is wrong and their prices are fair. If it doesn't need repair, they won't simply ""find something"" which is done at many other auto service centers. 

Today for example, I thought my car would need a new transmission when in fact it was just a loose part. The mechanic (Scott) simply put it back in place, tested to verify it ran well, and then sent me on my way. NO CHARGE for work not done. I expected to at least pay for labor but they didn't charge me for it. This morning I thought I'd have to purchase a new transmission at several thousand dollars, but instead walked away within a $31 bill for an oil change. Can you believe that in this day and age?

Bob McLeod, the owner of this family business, is a pleasure to deal with, and has earned his 20+ year A+ accredited rating with the Better Business Bureau. We know we are in good hands with Sunland and can't imagine going anywhere else for auto repairs.

PS - they are open Monday through Friday AND on Saturdays too!"
positive,"I own a 2005 VW Touareg that was driving very rough, and my check engine light came on. Desert VW quoted me almost $2000 for a new transmission, even though they weren't even sure that was the problem. Pacific Auto Care diagnosed bad spark plugs and a hole in the vacuum  hose. It cost me less than $500. I was thisclose to letting Desert VW try and fix it -- so happy I went to Pacific! My car now runs perfectly."
positive,"I went to Carlife when I had my check engine light come on.  They called me as soon as they pulled the codes, walked through potential problems and outlined their next steps.
They then called me after they completed the next steps, with the problem and a price as well as time estimate.
Overall, they have been honest, quick to communicate and affordable. I would definitely return and recommend them to a friend."
positive,Daren is really good manager of that store . Good place for your car service highly recommended . I went there to check engine light with 7 codes . With all the honest they gave the small simple reason that made the 7 codes up . Other place could v made big deal out of that . Simply honest .
positive,"We were recommended this place by our usual mechanic, Sandy & Sons. Our car was having transmission problems. Gary tried replacing a part but it didn't work. Some further research on both our parts revealed a service bulletin for the engine computer, something that would have to be fixed at the dealer. Gary had a lot of good advice and was kind enough to wave the charge on the part he replaced because it was not the source of the problem. Thanks Gary!"
positive,"I had my Ford Explorer transmission fixed in 2007. They rebuilt it and put in a performance kit. It still works great. Gary and staff are top notch-very knowledgeable, customer service oriented, and their service is fairly priced."
positive,After my car started having apparent transmission problems. I took it to a dealership ($100 just to look at it) and said I needed a complete new $3300 transmission. AAMCO wanted $600 just to diagnose it and expected $2K-3K service. Bob at Sunland was the only guy who took the time to check if there could be any other causes for my car woes. Only $200 later and I've got a working car and Sunland has a very loyal customer for all my future car needs.
positive,Came in to install steering wheel control and to clean up mess made by previous installer. They were fast and super friendly. White guy with pony tail installed it and he was very knowledgeable. Also provided a courtesy diagnosis test for my check engine light. This will be my go to place for now on much cheaper than audio express. Thanks.
positive,"5 stars are not enough
I went in to get a new radio for my 2003 Toyota Corolla.  The install was taking longer than expected when the manager came to tell me the good news-bad news.  Good news is the radio is in and it works.  The bad news is your car wont start and we havent figured out why yet.  At this point I am instantly picturing a several hundred dollar repair bill not the mention the inconvenience of waiting until monday to get to my mechanic to fix it.  
A few minutes later Chris, who was working on the problem shows me the problem, some bushing cotter pin part that makes a connection in the transmission.  Apparently some mechanic at some point replaced it with a bread tie. WTH?!? When they pulled the old radio they had to put gearshift all the way down and the tie broke. But could have broken at any time....cuz it is a freakin' bread tie and meant to hold a plastic bag shut not keep a car running. I could do without that kind of mcgyvering! 
Chris told me the part to get at Auto Zone and told me he would install it.  Off to Auto Zone I go and they sell me the wrong thing.  Chris looked up exactly what was needed, something Auto Zone should have done and then offered to go with me to get it to make sure it was right this time.  They only had one of the parts (another WTH? moment)  but Chris told me he could MAKE the other part, a bushing.  We go back to Audio Express and within a few minutes Chris had the part made, installed and my car running again.  I have tunes again and a car that isn't going to stop running and cost me money for someone to figure out why.  OH, and he noticed one of my tires was low on air and added some air for me.  Again, this is a car stereo place, not a mechanic.  Best customer service EVER!

AUDIO EXPRESS AND CHRIS SPECIFICALLY WERE MY HERO TODAY!!!!!"
positive,"As a customer, it is hard to know whether what you are being told is correct. I purchased a car that had an issue that I was told was fixed...and then the car stopped shifting. I called kens this morning and they said to bring it in and they would work me in. Already 3 stars for answering the phone, being quick about asking the issue and determining if they could help over the phone and then offering to work me in without an appt needed. I drove the car down and was asked what was going on. I explained the issue and what i was told previously. Instead of working me later in the day, he grabbed the scanner and told me to pull the car up front. That earns another 3 stars for starting on the problem right away and saving me an uber trip. He hooked up the scanner, went through all of the gears, turned it off and on and went through a full diagnosis right there in front of me. When he was done, he said it looks like the issue was fixed, he reset the code and said it may just need to sync up. I was satisfied with that answer, but he went further to tell me that the issue is not an internal issue, it would be external and referred me to another shop that is honest and could take a look at some other problems i am having. This gets another 4 stars because instead of letting me leave thinking if the issue starts up again, i will be out $2000, he put my mind at ease that it is an external transmission issue in one of the components and probably a rebuild will not be in my future. All of this and i was in and out within 10 minutes. I cannot believe any business would be this helpful, quick and kind. I cannot say enough good things about kens transmissions. I think i have them at 10 stars but am limited to 5 through yelp. If you are having transmission issues, please take your car here, you will not be disappointed!!!!!!"
positive,"I called to schedule an appointment. Kuba was super nice and chill. I told him I had a 95 Nissan Standard pickup with an engine light on, and a jerky shift into reverse. He was straight up and honest and explained that prior to 96, engine light codes weren't universally readable by the same machines, and that many car manufacturers needed proprietary gear to read their individual engine lights codes. Because of this, his shop didn't have the right gear to read mine properly, so he referred me to a place that might be able to do so. Regarding my jerky shift into reverse, he also referred me to a place that specializes in transmission repairs, in order to save me from having an entire transmission replaced. Such honesty! Next time my daily driver poops out on me (a Hyundai), I'm taking it here.

EDIT 10/21/2018: I just took my Hyundai in to have the drive belts replaced. Prompt and friendly. Fair pricing and honest work. They even showed me the old cracked and worn belts. I think I found my new go-to mechanic. YAY."
positive,"I've been coming here to get my car serviced for over 4 years now. Their service is always outstanding so I think it merits a review.

When I come to service my car, everyone is so friendly. They're so knowledgeable, and they tell you what the process is from beginning to end-- even if it is just an oil change. They'll tell you when your car pulls in, they'll tell you when it's getting the oil change, they'll tell you when there's a problem.

Point inspection-every time you take your car in for service, they check EVERYTHING. I mean your tires, tread, transmission, filter, etc.

Christian Viray is my go-to guy every time I come to get my car serviced. I don't know crap about cars and I was always so apprehensive of going to other car service shops like Jiffy Lube because I feel like they may not be 100% with you all the time. When I come to Christian, he breaks down everything to the detail. He'll tell you at what point you'll need to get something changed and where your car is actually at, he'll tell you if it is super important to get things changed now or if you can ride it out for a little longer. He makes sure you're comfortable before you make a decision on how you want to handle your car, and he's always transparent. 

Bonus! They wash your car every time you get it serviced. I love that they back my car up every time so I can just take off (because I'm really bad at backing out of parking spaces). Also, they give you free drinks while you get your car serviced. And free WiFi!"
positive,"It's been about 12 years since I had the need to have the service of this family owned establishment.  It had also been about 8 years since I've had my brakes checked on my truck.  They checked my brake system for free and reported to me that my truck was in great shape.  Excellent service.   While there I also found that they now do limited services on other things like transmissions, A/C, and batteries.  And the AC inside the waiting area worked great"
positive,"G&G Autohaus said ""total transmission overhaul"" and wanted $5000, but I came here instead and ended up paying just a fraction.
Based on my extensive experience of car ownership and technical understanding, I can deeply recommend Good Care Transmission as your first and last stop for any transmission needs. They were very honest with me which is so very unusual in this business and in this town not least. And they make sure to do a quality job too. I thank Henry from the bottom of my heart!"
positive,"My muffler was loud and, on the recommendation of My husband, I found myself at Affordable Muffler! I had no appointment, just walked right in when they opened at 9 am. I'm glad I was there early- they get busy fast! I told them what was wrong and they took my car right back to a bay. They gave me a diagnosis and estimate and asked me if I wanted to proceed based on the price they quoted me. Seeing as everything stemming from the catalytic converter (nit the cat. itself, but everything else) needed to be replaced, their price of $195 (which included tax, parts and labor) seemed pretty fair and I had them go ahead and make the repair. I cannot explain how much quieter my car is now! I was in and out in an hour and a half with my car sounding brand new. I'm ecstatic with the results and would highly recommend this business to my friends. I never felt pressured into buying anything and I didn't feel like I was being taken advantage of. Everyone there was very friendly and easy to do business with. I would suggest getting there at open or calling to make an appointment however!"
positive,"Brought my ram 2500 there and Scott I believe was the owners name told me there is nothing wrong with my transmission. didn't charge me a dime. Later found out I had bad fuel and that was the cause of my problem.
very honest."
positive,Once again we were extremely pleased with the service we received. Alejandro was knowledgeable and friendly and got our car repaired in a timely manner. We are very pleased with the service we received. We will definitely recommend and continue to use Tempe Honda for our service needs.
positive,They couldn't fix my transmission problem but they correctly diagnosed it as one. Even came back for a followup inspection after I took it to an actual tranny shop and they reported it as an AC problem. Ended up being the Tranny Flex Plate. Got it fixed at the dealership.
positive,"Came here to have my muffler looked at since someone had hit me from behind and damaged it.  The man there greeted me and was friendly from beginning to end.  He was honest - and after raising my car up, brought me over to look at the damage, told me in detail what needed to be done and quoted me $95 to replace it including labor.  He had it done in 45 minutes as promised.  It's a hole in the wall kind of place, but they did a great job and he was honest with me and friendly all the same."
positive,"Jeff came highly recommended by a whole slew of friends. After getting a few estimates for my muffler that were between $400 and $500, I took it to Jeff, who came in at $170. I was highly suspect of the other places trying to rip me off, including the place that had replaced the entire exhaust system a year prior. The repair was done quickly and flawlessly. No one is there to answer the phone, so leave a message and Jeff will get back to you pretty much right away. This really is as good as it gets."
positive,"Took longer that promised to get car repaired. However, they did a good job!"
positive,"I had a fantastic experience with AAMCO. It is quite scary when your transmission is acting up. I had it towed to the Valley View location based on the reviews I read on yelp. I had an idea of what was wrong with the car and the man on the phone listened attentively. 

They called me a few hours later and told me that my car as of now was actually running fine, the code had shut off and I could come and get it, no charge. I was so thrilled to hear this! They could have told me a different story; as unfortunately many mechanic shops would have done to a single woman to take me for some money, but they certainly did not. 

About a couple weeks later the car stopped shifting again. I had it towed over. They called me within a couple of hours to tell me that it was just a simple speed sensor. Easy and cheap fix. I had my car back by the end of the day! 

The customer service here surpasses most business's I have work with in Las Vegas. They are honest and expert in their line of work. If only all business here could be this trustworthy!"
positive,"After Aamco on Cave Creek Road tried to rip me off Phil , the manager,  checked my transmission out and saw if I had any error codes which I didn't. He didn't even charge me. If this man does work for people he doesn't know and doesn't try to make money what will he do for his customers?  I guarantee this place is a five star transmission shop . An Honest reputable, business."
positive,"They are great. Incredibly helpful and honest.
I first took my car to autozone after my check engine light went on. They told me that it was the catalytic converter but couldnt pinpoint the problem so they suggested I fix a number of things. I took my car to Samurai Motors and Yoshi was able to tell me exactly what it needed. He was so helpful and kind. I recommend this place to anybody with any car. I will be coming back here for all my car needs."
positive,"Visit #1
My AC and Heater went out and my check engine light was on. Between Mike, Tom and Jovan they were a dream team. Bumpy beginning but they ended up knocking it out of the park with the mysterious problems my engine was showing. They dug and dug and didn't give up! Can't be more grateful for dedicated individuals! 




Visit #2 6/27/17
Stand up guys as usual. Super duper happy Mike always so helpful and he knows what he's talking about. He took one look at my ugly engine and was able to point out most of the problems.  Clearly the word spread that these guys are the real deal because everybody wanted Pep Boys at Jones to work their magic in their cars. They were so busy and yet they took the time to really hear me out. Mike is one heck of a guy explaining everything in a manner that was clear and Jovan is right up there with excellent customer service skills. Honestly I live super far now and driving that long road is so worth it because of them.  Pep Boys company needs to recognize hard workers such as these guys. I just can't say it enough. Thank you guys!"
positive,"I don't usually give reviews but if any Yelpers ever need to have their car worked on by an honest shop with an honest manager, go see "" Brandon"" 

My folks have an older German car (380 SL )and we discovered our Brake light came on. I was under the impression the pads must need replacing and off I went to see Brandon. To my surprise, Brandon tells me I am just low in Brake fluid and need a flush for $80. Wow, a shop that actually looks out for their customer !

I also asked Brandon to change the transmission oil and Brandon said "" he rather I not do it "" because his shop might not be an expert with older German cars !

Thumbs up to Brandon and his crew ! Brandon just got a customer for life !!!"
positive,"A2 Auto is the best! Will, the owner, is such a honest trustworthy mechanic. This is the second time I have been to his shop, and they never disappoint. I have a 2007 Audi A4 2.0T. The first time they changed my struts and transmission mount. Just recently, my ignition coil on cylinder four went out, and I had the car towed to Audi Las Vegas for them to diagnose it. After a whole day of diagnosing, the Audi dealer called me and informed me that I needed a new engine. I asked if there was anything else I could do, and they said no. So, I had the car towed to A2 Auto, and in the same day they diagnosed the car and solved the problem; Just needed a new ignition coil. I will never go to Audi again, and only bring my car to A2! They saved me the $10,000 I would've spent at the Audi dealer if I listened to there false diagnosing! I just had A2 do my timing belt too, and the car is running great!"
positive,"I called to price a part on my car today and spoke with Martin (Marty) in service. I have also done business with Tim in service. 
Today I had Martin who said to bring my car in to get an estimate. I came on my lunch hour and received a ride back to work ( that took a little longer than I thought -the ride wait time) only because the driver was out shuttling other customers . That can't be helped. May have just left with people and driving takes time . The driver was awesome - really nice guy . 
Service went amazingly well as far as calling me back with the estimate and even emailing me the details . I did notice one thing in the email showed as not needing service and I know it is due- fuel system cleaning but that may be included in the 90k service estimate. Not sure.
Marty / Martin went over details of the car with me and the estimate as well. I know that  Nissan service and any sales person even where I work will try to get the customer to make a commitment to purchase said service that day. It's important to make the sale because chances of a customer actually coming back after they leave , well the percentage goes down . 
At first I told Marty/Martin I wanted to sleep on this , then he offered to detail my car or even glue/ re-attach my broken off rear view mirror if I made the decision to fix and go with a loaner car . Nissan is really good about providing a replacement vehicle while yours is being repaired. 
So anyway I told him yes, I'll fix it. However on my way back to Nissan to get a loaner car my gut instinct to go with my first decision to take my car back home and sleep on this a few days or think about it a few days  ....well I just had to take it home. I need more time to consider my options since I am looking at $4200 roughly to repair a 2006 Nissan Murano.   I need more time to decide whether to repair or replace with another car.  - service here was good even though I took the car and did not opt to fix it today. I am someone who takes time to weigh my options. Marty was understanding  even though he did not get service scheduled with me today. I am going to weigh my options over the weekend when I'm not having to deal with a ton of other things that cropped up in my hectic week. 
I would definitely take this car to the service man Marty/Martin. I also recommend Tim .
This time Marty helped me and I would go with him. 
I understand the other reviews about sales. Some sales reps like Lydia Martinez are the best and some can be pretty bad as far a buying a car. 
As a first time Nissan owner (The car is a 2006 I had it a long time) I  have been disappointed in many things with this car but I also like the car. 
I have also been frustrated with Nissan headquarters in general (for not covering a broken feel tank assembly /float which keeps the check engine light on which prevents the car from passing emissions (I did get it to pass by putting country gas from Cottonwood , Az in there ) The check engine light goes off when using conventional gas which is country gas compared to city gas which is clean burning gas CBG.
I also didn't like the fact that the driver seat broke and came un-mounted which was a safety issue and that wasn't covered either
I have this fixed now.
The thing is service department at Nissan is generally pretty good. They do seem to care about our opinions & they do send out surveys to improve service.
These folks here at Nissan well it may not be their fault  what corporate says or does.
I'm just saying give people a chance if you're nice to them they will also be kind to you. 
They are employees of Nissan, but they're also human beings working a job. Let's face it none of us would be at any of our jobs if we didn't get paid . If we all didn't have to work to pay our bills then we would all be sitting on the beach in Hawaii or doing something we really enjoy. 
I think Nissan does a really good job with picking their service advisors. I believe Those service advisors do a pretty decent job for the customers. 
I give the service department a five-star rating."
positive,"Just had my exhaust done on my 88 mustang 5.0 today and I'm happy as can be! Isn't ridiculously loud anymore, but still sounds good. They hooked me up so I could still unbolt my mufflers if I wanted to. Good price, great work and with a quickness! Wasn't even there for an hour before my car was already done. Love this place and I will be bringing all my exhaust work to them!"
positive,"I wanted to take the time to acknowledge the AMAZING experience I had with John Otero and the team at Chapman Ford. I had an issue with my transmission control module. I called in and was greeted with professionalism and kindness. I was assured that my concern would be taken care of and encouraged to come is as soon as possible. My car was fixed in a day AND I was provided with a rental, so I could get to work. The staff was wonderful in the service and rental department. They would be my #1 choice for any future concerns with my car. Thank you so much!"
positive,They did awesome job and was very Honest. I went in thinking I need a new transmission and all it was a wiring harness that need to be fixed soon instead of charging me $3000 I was only charged $500 in the truck runs very smoothly and they fix the problem I drop my car off on Saturday and they got the part on Monday and I have my car back on Tuesday highly recommend take your car here Scott it was very honest with us and his son is a really nice guy!
positive,"Now I know why they are a yelp 5 star shop!  My fiancé and I have a 7.3 diesel truck and our transmission was in need of service. Some friends recommended Todd the tranny technician over there and when I first walked in I was greeted by Scott. Scott was such a nice person and easy to talk to and he deserves 10000 stars for his customer service.  Coming from an automotive industry myself as a general manger, I know first hand how you should run a successful business and this business is it! The reason why we brought it here is because my company does not specialize in transmissions so I rather take it somewhere that does. Not only the price was great, but they got our truck done in a time they promised and that is very important. Our transmission needed a complete rebuild and we knew we could trust Todd in doing so. I plan on doing more business with them. Oh and on top of it all... They have a nationwide warranty! I highly recommend Scott and his technicians for any repairs you need. Especially for transmissions. Thanks guys! Transmission shifts great! We can't wait to tow!"
positive,"Sabrina and Henry are a true dynamic duo!! I will happily drive three hours from California to Vegas to Good Care Transmission. The reviews you read here are spot on and authentic. While traveling across the country I wanted to get a transmission service before going up the mountain to my home, where the mechanics are slow, expensive and questionably ethical. Sabrina and Henry quickly and carefully diagnosed my entire car and listed priorities for me. Henry reassured me a transmission service would not fix what I was feeling in my car. He did however alert me that my air filter desperately needed to be changed and something else related needed a cleaned. Was it coincidence that a simple fix completely stopped the stuttering I attributed to my transmission? IDK They also quickly replaced a washer fluid motor, giving me the option to clean the old one instead to see if it would work. I opted for new, as it was an inexpensive part. As I sat in their waiting room on two different days for a couple hours each, I saw many clients new and old treated with professionalism, care and efficiency. Sabrina and Henry are truly loved by their clients. Save your sanity and money, don't go anywhere else. They could have charged me for multitudinous repairs I didn't need, or could wait. Instead, they chose to win my trust and gain me as a repeat client. They ALMOST make me want to move to Vegas."
positive,"The first time I'd ever heard of Aamco was about 5 years ago, when a friend had an old Dodge project car transmission rebuilt there.  Then, earlier this year, I was helping a friend with new shocks for his CRV.  We found the complete kits, and I set out to look for a shop that would install them.  Every shop, except AAmco, quoted me the entire package as a rebuild, even though I explained that I didn't need to have them put together, it was all pre-assembled, can you just quote me a labor charge.  Aamco immediately knew what I was talking about, and thought that 2 hours of labor was quite reasonable to basically unbolt the old stuff and bolt the new strut assemblies back on.  They were perfect.

Then, I got word I needed to drive to LA for work.  I hadn't had my old 2004 Ford truck on the highway in 3 or 4 years, so I called and asked them if they would be interested in doing a physical for my truck; basically give it a good look and see what needs to be done, and to please see if they could find out why the check engine light is on.

I left it with them, and when it was ready I went in to hear what they had found out.  Scott explained that everything looked good, but the reason the check engine light was on was that both the lower and upper intake manifold gaskets needed to be replaced, and that would cost 600$.  I needed to schedule and save for the job, so I explained that and asked what I owed them for their time.  Scott thought for a second, then said ""well, we put about a quart and a half of oil in, so how about 5$?""

I couldn't believe it -- and tried to get them to at least charge me for an hour of labor -- but it was still $5.  WOW!

The story continues.  about 3 weeks later, I scheduled the repair.  it was supposed to take 5 hours.  I got ""that feeling"" when 4pm came around and still no word from them.  Sure enough, the job was taking longer than they planned due to all sorts of crud in there, including burned-on liquid gasket that a previous ""mechanic"" had used.  

Noon the next day, I went to get the truck.  I was expecting a labor bill of over $1200 due to them spending more than twice the time .  Nope!  $600.  They totally ate the additional labor expense, and ""we spent an an extra $16 to replace some bushings that were about to go, hope you don't mind"".  AWESOME!

 I have one of those OBD port testers that connect via bluetooth with a phone app, so I reset the codes and went about my merry way.  the truck seemed to be running very well.  Then the check engine light came back on.  Uh oh.  The fault code was new - and it had to do with a malfunctioning part in the intake manifold (P2004).  back it went.  I was really nervous, because when I researched that code it indicated that if the part couldn't be make to work properly it would require an entirely new intake manifold.  Sure enough, I got the call I was hoping to not get, would I like the ford original part for 1600 or an aftermarket part for 600.  I went with the 600$ part.

Guess how much they charged me for labor to 1.)  take the intake back off and see what was wrong, 2.) install the new intake, along with another set of new gaskets.  

Zero.  They didn't charge me a penny for almost 20 hours of work.  

Ladies and gentlemen, if the superb classic cars you can see parked in their lot awating work isn't enough of a clue, hopefully this story will let you know that, IMHO, the folks at AAmco are some of the most honest and upright people out there.  Truly remarkable in this day and age."
positive,"I was referred to Ken's Transmissions by my lifelong mechanic over at Mitch's Econo Lube on Tatum and Bell.  If Mitch and his team recommend someone, I trust that the person and the business are full of integrity and honesty.  I was not disappointed in any way, shape, and/or form.

I contacted Ken's Transmissions and spoke with Phil.  From the very first moment of contact, Phil was open and honest with me.  He did not tell me he could get to my car that day, but could the next.  To me, that immediately set the stage for an honest and forthcoming experience.  I already knew I would not be promised something and delivered something else.  After I dropped my car off, and explained the issues I was having, Phil said he would get back to me the next day.  He certainly did.  

What was most impressive was that his and the whole team's integrity and honesty shined through in the smallest of actions and interactions.  Phil was truthful and open that he did not suspect the problem I was worried about.  He told me that my most likely issue was not one that would require mechanical repair, and that it was likely something that could be fixed without major repair.  

What is great is that the team at Ken's Transmissions conduct themselves ethically, morally, honestly, and with kindness.  By being ethical, moral, honest, kind, and helpful, they have earned not only any and all future transmission business from me and my family, but also exclusive referrals for transmission work from anyone that crosses my path.

Thank you, Ken's Transmissions Team, for being who you are, and for taking care of me."
positive,"Came in here last week with the thoughts of having to get my belts replaced, turned out that the problem was my rocker arm needed to be adjusted... Also my oil was about 4 quarts low which I didn't even notice til they told me, and they topped it off for me at no charge, my check engine light was on too and they also took care of that... They took care of all problems I came in with plus extra, I was practically in n out, everything only took about 30mins... Fast n friendly, thanks to Pete and Amber, they really helped me out alot... finally found a spot I can trust with my car... Thanks again guys! I'll definitely be back.."
positive,"Went to the shop based off Yelp reviews. I showed up prepared to pay upwards of $1500 for a transmission.  Turns out I only needed a grommet and only paid $50. In the future I will send everyone I know here. 

I didn't take advantage of it but I believe they will tow your car for free."
positive,"Really nice group of good ol boys in here. I try to avoid shops at all cost because most of the time they up charge for stuff you don't even need. Not here tho!  I had a problem with my transmission that I couldn't fix for the life of me and I'm pretty mechanically inclined. I had a general idea it was one or a few solenoids that were bad or it was the infamous transition rebuild time(Dodge transmission). No other shop would look at it because it was over 200K miles and on top of that every other place wanted $150 diagnostic fee. Well I noticed Aamco does free diags so what can I lose. 

They spent a good hour, hour and a half messing with it and came to the conclusion yeah, 3 solenoids are shot. On top of this they explained to me which ones. Now granted, they wanted $600 after everything is done which is okay...  but I am on my last dollar so I got my stuff from a junk yard and my transmission so far works flawlessly. However, if my issue happens again, I will go ahead and let them take care of this since I'm just a backyard mechanic."
positive,"I was provided with outstanding customer service. My check engine light came on. I was greeted by a gentleman by the name of John I explained what my vehicle was doing and told him I had an extended warranty, John took the time out to call the warranty company and explained to me the protocol for the warranty in which I had. His company was not contracted with Superior Tire's. John was nice enough to assist me still with making sure the check engine light wasn't a major problem he explained to me his findings and gave me really good advice. Even though I didn't do business with this company I would recommend this. Superior Tires to anyone. Very friendly and honest customer service. I appreciate John for assisting me and making me aware of the problem I was having so when I went where my warranty was contracted with I knew what I was talking about and they was surprised I knew. They could not pull a fast one which they tried. I owe that to John. Thank you so very much sir."
positive,"Craig is the man. I took my 2014 Ford Mustang GT in to get repaired, there was substantial damage on the passenger side. This car is my baby and Craig took care of me, called me all the time and gave me updates about my car. He even went in and fixed things that he didn't need to. I highly recommend this place to anyone who needs to get their car repaired. He will work with you and give you the best deal possible."
positive,"Ray - Thank you. You completely took care of my long list of problems with this 04 BMW 325i with 163k miles. For several months I have been toying with the idea of buying something new & getting into car payments again. Got so lucky to have reached out to your shop via Yelp. The quote you provided was far below what other shops shared, and I saved thousands. The work you did is above and beyond. This car hums again! No stalling, no oil leaks, smooth transmission, and feels pleasant to drive. Hoping to put another 100k miles on this baby. Additionally, thank you for picking me up and making me home. So I did not have to worry about arranging transportation to-from the shop!

Ray, I will be sending anyone I know your way. Thank you and your team for the hard work.

Ricardo"
positive,Had an issue with my transmission. Ask them for a second opinion. They took there time to test drive with computer and then let me know the results. When I asked him what I owed them he said not a thing. There prices do seem reasonable and they are a very trustworthy shop. Have earned my future business and will recommend. Hard to find a good shop now days and these guys are awesome.
positive,"My automatic 1992 Jeep wrangler lost reverse, 2nd and 3rd gear. When I got to AAMCO, one of the workers immediately saw my inability to reverse and assisted me in parking the vehicle. Scott greeted me and offered a free diagnostic. After getting a quote, I left the vehicle for a complete transmission rebuild. When I got it back they informed me of a pre-existing problem they saw and repaired it at no additional cost (SWEET!)

Driving the Jeep home I did notice a different noise than before so I took it back to AAMCO to investigate. While investigating further they found a small leak at one of the hoses (fixed at no charge) and they pulled out the tranny again and took it apart to make sure they were no issues with it. Long story short, the torque converter (separate but also part of the transmission) they had sent out to a 3rd party for rebuild had developed a crack in the housing so they had to send it back out for another rebuild. 

Overall it took longer than I had hoped but Scott and his team worked diligently on resolving my several issues, dropped me off home, and only charged me for the original rebuild.

Although they specialize in transmissions, they are a full service shop and can do much more!

I plan on coming back for any issues above my mechanical capabilities. 
They have earned my business and my trust!"
positive,"Great place to have your car repaired. They are honest, friendly, and work with you and help your needs met."
positive,"Went her to have my car repaired after a minor accident. They were fast, I was able to get in for an estimate within a few days on a Thursday and took it in for repairs the following Monday. 

I like that they have an app and they update you the status of your car regularly. I only chose this place because the insurance chose it, but I would definitely return."
positive,Very kind and timely service. I ran into transmission trouble when driving down to visit and they gave me a fair and accurate assessment. Great people.
positive,"Tony is the simply the best. I was in and out with a new muffler and pipes in less than an hour for a total of $215. Thrilled. 

Professional service and I highly recommend. 

Thank you Tony!"
positive,"I would drive (or get towed) here from anywhere in the Valley to have these guys work on my car. 

Brought my older Nissan van here. I thought my power steering pump had gone bad... no power steering and lots of squealing from my belt. They only had to replace an idler pulley that had seized and the worn belt. Their honesty and integrity did not go unnoticed.

This last time, I had bottomed out and caused a leak in my transmission. The mechanic showed me where the leak was and what his plan of attack was to fix it. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and left me feeling that I was going to be taken care of, not gouged. I later found out he was the owner.

Both experiences, for me, where as pleasant as if a trusted friend was working on my car... and the bill was more than reasonable both times!! 

Thank you Path Less Traveled Automotive for your honesty, integrity, and customer service!"
positive,"Took my Jeep in for shift issues with my automatic transmission. I met with Scott and took my car for a quick test drive to show him what the issue was. When we returned he had one of his mechanics make a minor adjustment and the transmission shifted perfectly! He said no charge and I provided a small tip to the mechanic who made the adjustment. It would have been easy with 160k± miles for them to suggest at least a full service or more but the fact and willingness to do a quick adjustment and send me on the way has earned them a customer for life.

Well done guys! JJ"
positive,"Highly recommend! A family run business you can trust, plain and simple. I do not work on cars but ran into transmission issues. I wasn't sure what is exactly was, but I do know replacing your transmission is costly and time consuming. Thankfully they told me the car was able to be serviced without a complete replacement. They walked me through the estimate before doing any work and quickly completed the job the same day. No hassles or up-selling. 

Car runs better than before my issues cropped up!"
positive,"After driving 40 minutes out of Vegas, on our way home to Reno, the check engine light went on and we knew our only way home was by turning around. Once back in Vegas we went to the nearest Firestone only to be turned away due to a 5 hour wait. The technician called another location and told us they could get us in so we drove 30 minutes only to find out they had a 5 hour wait too!

At this point our spirits were down and we had little hope of returning from our Thanksgiving vaca to our jobs in less than 24 hours.

Driving up the street we saw that Tire Works Total Car Care was open and so *fingers crossed* we pulled in.

They got us in and an hour later had the diagnostics on what was ailing our truck. We asked if it could be done by close of business and the answer was YES!

Our truck was done in less than 3 hours and we were home that night. The truck runs great and we are extremely please with the fantastic service we received. Especially on a holiday weekend!"
positive,"I am so pleased of how well we were treated during the mess of our transmission issue. They were honest and fixed ONLY what was necessary. There are payment options available and they work hard to get you the help you need for it. What I love most is that they want you to come back for a check up in 10 days. Really, what other place wants to know how you're doing after taking your money? Also, they are very helpful with questions on anything and they don't try to choke you down with unnecessary problems. You will be happy to bring your car here! Our Honda Accord is running smooth so far. :)"
positive,"This business is incredible! I was referred by a friend who had been to Curt's before. I also researched through the Better Business Bureau and was pleased to find out Curt's won their ethics award. With all the positive feedback, I made an appointment to have my transmission checked as I thought it may be starting to fail. The facility is spotless, the gentlemen behind the counter were polite and professional, and the owner's wife even came out and introduced herself!  Who does that anymore?? 

Curt's charged me less than the amount quoted for the diagnostic test and didn't try to scam me about needing a new transmission. Bottom line, the auto repair service and outstanding customer service totally exceeded my expectations! Not only will I be returning to Curt's, I've been sharing my positive experience with friends and family.  Use Curt's Auto Repair for any car issues. You won't regret it. I'm sold!"
positive,"I'm not a handy man at all. God gave me the gift of art and hospitality. My exhaust system was running loud. When I looked under my car I noticed that the attachment thingies on my Y shaped pipe were rusty and loose. I took my car to the nearest big chain muffler/ brake place and they told me that they had to replace the whole Y shaped pipe and put all these new attachment things on as well as a bunch a mechanic language I was not familiar with. An hour later my quote was nearly $800 dollars. So, I went online and googled cheap mufflers. Affordable Mufflers came up in the search. I read reviews and was skeptical of taking my car in because of the sketchiness of the neighborhood that Affordable Muffler is is. At this point I knew I didn't want to pay too much because once I rack up 200k miles on my car I'm going to get a new one anyways. I figured a quote was a quote and it was my choice to get the damn thing fixed or get a quote elsewhere.

The man at the counter was pretty brash but HONEST. He wasn't concerned with making you feel good. There is a sign at the front entrance that said ""difficult customers will be charged extra"". I sensed that his business was compromised on no gimmicks or bullshit. Get'em in get 'em out was my experience. He had his guys take a look at my car and about 20 minutes later he told me that it needed two flex pipes. I asked him about the Y pipe and he said it was fine. He quoted me 110$ had his guys put the pieces on in a few minutes and sent me on my way with a smooth and quiet exhaust. Thanks! 

Pros: fast service, affordable, and honest  Cons: if you want to read Better Home and Gardens, Cosmo, Time, and all those fancy magazines bring your own. The lobby has no form of entertainment or squeaky clean bathroom but Hey why would that matter if Affordable Muffler is cheap and efficient. 
Getting my car fixed here took up less than an hour of my day and was cheap. I asked for a few business cars to keep in my glove box too."
positive,"So after moving to Scottsdale, I had to look for a facility to handle maintenance and repairs on my LR3.

After some searching, I found Rover N Techs which is only 10 minutes away.

Very nice facility, easy to find and was able to quickly drop off my vehicle for a major service.

Was completed within the time frame and price that was quoted.

The staff here are excellent.

Will continue to have Rover N Techs service my LR3 ..... transmission service coming up soon which is a bit $$$ but it usually is for most vehicles."
positive,5 star service really good customer service they back up their warrantee and are caring and I will definitely come back and get all my muffler  services from them what a great experience the owner is very nice! They defidently care about their customers!
positive,"Worked with Javon to get the air in my car repaired. Turns out I needed a whole new system. He found the unique part, kept me posted on progress and got it done exactly when he said it'd be done! He has exceptional customer service!! Recommended my brother there!!"
positive,"Courtesy is exactly what you get here. We purchased a 2013 Spark manual transmission. We we looking for weeks for one. Other dealers would call and say they had one, but you get there and it was an automatic or one dealer said they had one but had Chevy Sonic for us test drive. It was ridiculous what we went through.
We worked with Kelly H. and she was professional and not at all pushy nor was I felt that we needed to purchase the car from her. She did all the research for us and gave us a fair price after I pestered HER for many weeks. 
I definitely would recommend Courtesy Chevrolet. Do your research on the Internet first and be prepared as to what kind of car you want then go to Internet Sales through Courtesy Chevrolet. Thanks Kelly and Courtesy Chevrolet!"
positive,"Scott and everyone is awesome at sunland. I took my car to have them check out the transmission, Scott was completely generous to fill up my transmission fluid and diagnose the issue, he didn't even charge me. I would definitely recommend these guys!"
positive,"I have been a long time (3 year customer). My transmission went in my car. My wand went out the same day. I called the Arroyo store waving the white flag. I would have been happy to speak with ANY of them...thay are all awesome in their own right. I happened to get Ben. After listening to my sad story, Ben sent me to Addie at the North store took my payment and THEN....Can I just tell you...not only did Ben set me up with a new iStick BUT HE PERSONALLY HAND DELIVERED IT TO MY HOME AND SHOWED ME HOW TO USE IT. If there was ever ANY question, which there NEVER has been, in my mind that this wasn't the right store for me it was immediately silenced. Gotta say...that just takes personal service to an entirely whole new level. Thank you to that entire crew. They do an incredible job at that store and they smile while they do it."
positive,"Great stuffed pizza, so good, you may cry tears of joy.  Service is AOK.  The atmosphere is nice, 99% of the time.  I say this because the last time we went we sat at an indoor table close to the bar area.  About half way into our meal a homeless man walked in and started screaming at the owner, who happened to be sitting at the bar by himself eating a salad.  

He immediately got up and went behind the bar.  The homeless man sat down at the bar and began eating fistfuls of the salad and smearing his messy hands all over the bar top.  The owner quietly asked him to leave several times, but this guy was on a mission.  A mission to spread the word that the owner of Gino's had gone ""shoppin' at Macy's in Minnesota!!!!!""  He screamed it over and over again, and when the owner dude grabbed homeless dudes arm in an effort to usher him out the door things escalated.

The homeless guy screamed, ""don't touch me man!!  You been shoppin' at Macy's in Minnesota!!!""  This must mean that shopping at Macy's in Minnesota has big time cooties, but I don't know for sure.  That's when the owner informed him that he was going to call the police.  With that homeless man came over to our table, and without saying a word, leaned over dangerously close to our beloved pizza pie and stared omniously at it.  (He may have been receiving an intergalactic message.)  My dining partner and myself sat there silently shocked like we were watching a movie we weren't a part of.  

Moments later I heard the owner say, ""please don't bother my customers.""  To my surprise, homeless man decided not to help himself to our pizza, and cut short his transmission to the mother ship.  He instead headed back out to the bar area.  Just then a thoroughly bored looking copper showed up and escorted homeless man out.  

My dining companion looked at me and said, ""I told you we shouldn't have sat up front"".  

The food here is awesome.  Just don't sit up front, unless you be shoppin' at Macy's in Minnesota YO!!"
positive,Okay folks! Let's talk about Jiffy Lube! I have been to quite a few oil change establishments in the past. I always feel like most of them are trying to upsell you the whole time and not really doing a good job if you don't buy their other products. They always give you some type of cheap deal and then try to drop a hundred bucks on you. So I tried Jiffy Lube out. It's a name that's been around a long time and I have had success with them before. I've been going to this one specifically for a while now. But wanted to make sure that the service they gave wasn't just a one-time deal. I arrived first thing in the morning and was first in line. I called the day before to ask about appointments and it was first come first serve. I got there about 15 minutes before they opened and was the only one in line. They opened on time and right away took me in. So far so good. I didn't get a chance to speak with the actual mechanics that do the oil changes and what not. The gentleman I did speak to who I've actually spoken to the past few times I've been there is always great to me. He doesn't try to upsell you. Shows you your air filter and if you want to change it or not is up to you. Right I know that it's up to you anyways but sometimes the pressure they try to put on you about it makes you feel obligated to buy it. But this guy doesn't. They were done with my car within minutes. He showed me my air filter and was like hey this is how it looks and do you want to get a new one it cost this much. They also mention that they do have a hundred thousand mile service for your transmission but it wasn't a pressure sell it was just a hey we have this and if you want to do it cool but but if not no worries I'll see you whenever. He really is probably the best person to be at the front. Always a nice guy and never trying to pressure you. Just gives you the info and that's it. Not a long conversation or rebuttals or anything like that. That's one of the reasons I continue going to this place. I know the name and the service is always good and there's no pressure. Keep it up Jiffy Lube! Apologize that I can't remember the gentleman's name but if you happen to be able to deduce who it is please tell him he does a great job!
positive,Took my car in for check engine light 02 sensor. Couldn't be happier. Worked around my schedule. So glad they moved into the neighborhood.Believe all the great reviews.
positive,"7-10-17 Paid $2,000 for rebuild. Newly rebuilt Transmission works fine. 

When i picked it up the A/C didn't work anymore (it did when i dropped out off). They kept it another day and fixed the A/C without a hassle. Loose ground wire. 

They seem to do good work however when i asked some more complicated questions about alternate repairs on another car ... which is only having a small transmission issue they were unfamiliar. 

Overall good impression for basic rebuilds and probably replacements but nothing too complicated

Update 9-14-17
Mostly fine but it did have a problem one time it didn't stuttered and didn't seem to want to shift gears. Monitoring it to see if it happens again. Only happened once.

Update 12-18-17
Trouble codes popping up for transmission. P0750 and P0751 for shift solenoid issues. Will update more when I take it in"
positive,"I have a very reliable auto and typically go in for oil changes. They do check things over when it is in there an let me know when things like, oh, your alternator bolt is missing. Good catch, better to find out in the shop then on the road. 

The lesson i have learned is that the basic oil change becomes a nightmare event for too many people when, the plugs are not properly replaced, filter not properly replace, wrong filter (transmission) changed, fill cap not replaced... i have heard lots of bad stories from people who take their cars to the chain quicky lube."
positive,"I cannot say enough about Medina's Automotive. Ernesto the owner is amazing. The prices are fair. He is very honest. I went in saying I needed a muffler and was ready to pay to get it done. He looked at it and told me it was not my muffler and a much cheaper fix. Saved me about $200.00. He did not have to tell me that at all, but he did. For any woman that need work on a car, wants peace of mind, fairn price  and treated with dignity...Medina's Automotive is the place to go. Again, Ernesto is the owner, he and his crew are friendly, professional and a pleasure to do business with. As long as I live in AZ, this is my  place to go to get my car fixed."
positive,"They were Wonderful!  Away from home, the transmission on my Focus failed.  I called Fort Mill Ford.  They took the car as soon as I arrived, had it ready  that afternoon, and found that it was covered by the warranty.   Special thanks for ""Big Dave,"" my service advisor."
positive,"Mark and his crew are simply the best.  I unfortunately have had MAJOR problems with my Frontier Nissan including a new transmission needed but HONEST-1 has fixed, repaired, rebuilt, etc.
I feel I have a new truck!
They have taken care of everything and care about me.  
I only bring my vehicle to Mark as my entire family does.  All my friends will to.
Dealing with Mark is total peace of mind.
Thank you Mark!
It's calming knowing we have an integrity mechanic in this town when we all have been so ripped off and taken advantage of.
And he happens to be so nice and knowledgeable about everything.
As far as I'm concerned.........he's THEE ONLY mechanic in town!!!!!"
positive,"As a young petite woman, I dread dealing with condescending mechanics, and particularly dealerships. I was SO delighted to find Independent Auto on Yelp. These guys are punctual, professional, and their estimates (time and cost) are spot on every time.

I've dealt primarily with Lee, who is quiet, respectful, and knows his stuff. My '10 Jetta Wolfsburg is still under powertrain warranty, and Lee advised me that a tranny problem I was experiencing was actually quite common and should be covered under my powertrain - but I'd have to go to the dealer. (Groan.)

After several days, the dealer still couldn't duplicate the problem, and I was beyond frustrated with the rep's flippant attitude. I called Lee, described what was happening, and asked for advice. He told me to ask to drive my car with the mechanic riding along to duplicate the issue, and told me if they wouldn't agree to that, I should call VW corporate, who would definitely take care of me.

He assured me the issue was totally legit - and that I was not hallucinating, as the dealer seemed to think. I was so impressed that Lee helped me nail down a fix when he didn't stand to make a dollar on the repair. After the dealer's mechanics got on the phone with corporate ""super mechanics,"" they eventually traced the problem to the mechatronics unit in the transmission - which was not only covered under warranty, but it was exactly what Lee had diagnosed in the first place."
positive,"I just got my car back from courtesy Chevrolet! I have been wary of dealerships and really any mechanic since my last vehicle. I was pretty much scammed out of thousands of dollars by camelback Kia right next door. So to say I was hesitant was an understatement. I took my car into autozone when the check engine light came on after only a few months of owning my Chevy trax. They informed me my fuel injector had an issue. However, Keith who helped me at courtesy, informed me it actually had nothing to do with the fuel injector. At first I thought I was being taken for AGAIN, but then he let me know that this was actually good news because the fuel injector was not covered under my warranty but this was! Not only did they get my car finished by the end of day but the paid for my Uber to and from work. When I arrived to pick my car up it was not quite finished so they gave me a voucher for a free drink and their CAFE! Yes, they literally have a cafe in their store where they have a menu of freshly made items and fancy coffee drinks etc. Kieth was super nice and overall it was one of my best experiences at a dealership I've probably ever had!"
positive,"Israel's Transmissions hands down has to be one of the greatest mechanic shops I have ever been to!  Israel is quite friendly, knowledgeable, and honest!  Their shop gets repairs done in a timely manner.  They are as honest as honest can be.  

They are truly miracle workers, and were able to diagnose and rebuild my 1998 Honda Accord's transmission!  The total cost was so reasonable, I could not even believe it!

I will be taking my car to Israel from now on when I have transmission issues!  

I highly recommend Israel's Transmissions to anyone and everyone in need of Transmission repairs!"
positive,"I bought a used car from another dealer, after having it a month, I noticed it would excessively smoke when I started it. I took it back where I bought it and was told they don't have Nissan certified techs (it isn't a Nissan dealer). I took it to Coulter and, after waiting almost a week for the extended warranty inspector to come look at it (not Coulter's fault) was told the claim was denied because the first dealer knew about the problem. 
It has oil sludge, oil building up on the pistons or something (I'm not a mechanic).
Pedro at Coulter was AMAZING! I had to pay for a rental from them because the extended warranty denied the claim. Pedro knocked a few days off the rental fee, some money off the diagnostic fee and was amazing to work with. I might buy another (new) Nissan and will only buy it at Coulter if I do

Another great success story for Pedro and Coulter Nissan. Went there today because the check engine light was on my Pathfinder, waited three hours at Coulter so Pedro could deal with the extended warranty company....RESULT!!  The car needs a new catalytic converter but the extended warranty company is covering it and my rental. This is just a fantastic dealer to work with!!"
positive,"Amazing shop, super fast, well priced and they do A+ work.  I have a 96 Honda Accord which rattled really bad when in idling, so i took it to Mad Hatter mufflers to have my cat heat shield welded on. While my car was on the lift they showed me that I had around 8 holes all the way down my exhaust.  They asked if I wanted them to fix this, so I said sure. They replaced the exhaust piping and welded the heat shield, and had my car out in 30 minutes.  Thanks to them my car in now a lot quieter. I highly recommend this shop."
positive,"I was referred to Ken's by John Jay Automotive in Scottsdale. Ken and Phil are really, really nice people. We hit it off right away. I checked a couple of nearby transmission shop and returned to Ken's to get the work done. 

Not only did Ken's do a good job,.... they did it for a good price. They securely stored my car for a couple of days at no cost after it was finished.

OH,.... I almost forgot,.... they drove me home when I dropped it off and picked me up when it was ready,.... very nice customer service. I did not need a 2nd person."
positive,"I first came here back in November and had a great experience. When my check engine light came on this past week, I decided to head to Busy Boots again. I already knew they have great customer service, but my experiences this week showed how they are truly willing to go above and beyond to take care of their customers. I took my car in on Monday and they replaced my intake valve and took care of some other issues, but the light came on again on Wednesday. I took it back in and the manager, Michael, worked on my car personally and explained everything that was happening with great detail. Apparently the part they had put in had a defect, but it was covered under warranty so I didn't have to pay any more than what I already had. They even gave me a loaner car to use for the day. 
Unfortunately, my check engine light came on AGAIN Friday as I was driving to work. I called and they told me to bring it in so they could look at it. I took it to AutoZone beforehand to have it scanned just to be sure and this time it was my catalytic converter. I spoke with Michael again and ended up crying a bit due to my frustration and the thought of having to pay even more. Michael sat and talked to me so I could once again understand what was going on with my car. They were able to give me a great deal on the repair, and Michael even paid for my Uber home since the rental car was already in use. While the situation itself was extremely frustrating, Michael and Wen handled everything perfectly! I normally don't write reviews, but I could not recommend this place enough!!"
positive,"Let start off by saying thank you to Victor Bustos from the service department. Ever since he has been my advisor he has been very friendly, respectful and professional which makes you stand out with your customer service. Recently I had taken my car in to get fixed from the transmission and Victor made sure that I was taken care of, from helping me getting a rental and also the female employee who helped me with my rental was amazing and great customer service . I just want to say that this new advisor team from their service department, You Guys Rock and thank you Victor for making me like a value customer!"
positive,"Honest-1 Auto on Warm Springs diffidently lives up to their name.A few months ago I brought my car here on a recommendation because it was doing the same thing only after a week of bringing it to Ford and paying over $600 to get my transmission checked at Ford Country, who told me that I would need to get a new transmission and found out I didn't need a new transmission what I needed was transmission fluid that was bone dry and it needed to be reset (that Ford should have done but didn't do) if not it would keep showing the same results..( Honest-1 charged me only for the transmission fluid) been driving perfect ever since.So when my boyfriend told me about his car I told him to bring it here for a second opinion to see if his power steering needed to be replaced. They advised him not to waste his money getting it done, (the other place was going to do the work and didn't tell him about anything else) because he had a crap load of other major issues with his car, that he'd be better off just getting a new car(his car is a 2005 on its last little wheels, that's ready to give birth to an engine on the Vegas asphalt one day!) and they didn't charge him for the diagnostic test, which the majority of the places won't ONLY if you get the work done there. All in all the husband and wife team that manage it are a blessing to come across as well as their mechanics. Honest-1 deserves 5 stars!"
positive,"Perjad has been a lifesaver on countless occasions. I've been coming here for years to service my Jetta/Audi and it feels like they've been given new life.

The level of expertise and knowledge you receive when coming here is unmatched. Whatever issue I'm facing it's refreshing to know it's being diagnosed properly.

Work such as timing belt replacements, brake pad/rotor replacements, oil changes, muffler repair is done promptly and with full honesty and transparency.

Gone are the days where I was forced to go to the VW dealership and pay $100 and a ""diagnostic fee"" which usually ended in having to change entire parts instead of actually repairing the problem.

I can confidently say that Perjad is the ""German Car Expert"". Thanks for all the great service you provide!"
positive,"Hi Hanna ans Shane,

I just wanted to drop an email and tell you that Southwest Bimmers has made me like my BMW for more than the looks.   Just a little background...I took my car to BMW of Henderson 2 different times to correct the transmission shifting issue.  The first time they kept my car for over a week to replace the engine mounts, they said that was the problem.  It did not fix the problem and i was out over $500 for my deductible and a diagnostic check fee.  The second time they flat out told me it was all in my head, ""I wasn't use to driving a performance vehicle.""  Unknown to them i have been driving 2 different Porsche models for the last 16 yrs and a Jaguar prior to that.  I had given up on being satisfied with driving a BMW.  When friends would tell me how ""nice"" my car was I'd tell them ""do not buy one!"" In fact i vowed NEVER to buy another BMW, EVER.  You replaced my thermostat and reset my adaptive values on my transmission. These two things corrected the rough idle, the hard shifting, and its smoother, and quieter.  One visit to your shop and my car runs like a dream.  Im no longer embarrassed to have passengers in my car.   Now I'm considering a 4 Series next year!  

As a result of such great results I have referred my Mother to you.

Again, Thank You for making my BMW well again,

AL Melby"
positive,"I am having my car repaired at the body shop next door. 

My insurance set me up to get a rental here. I am a tall guy, 6'4"", so it is tough to get a car with enough head room. The showed me what they had, and my head would have hit the roof on every bump. 

They started calling around to find a car for me from their other locations. Somehow they got a perfect car delivered right there for me, (I offered to drive anywhere to do the swap).

Their people were extremely courteous, and went above and beyond normal efforts to satisfy me. 

My sincere thanks!!"
positive,"Had to take my car in to have it looked at unexpectedly for some transmission issues. These guys were great! Pat in the front was super nice and amazing to deal with. The tech Aaron who looked at my car was extremely helpful, he was able to diagnose the problem and instead of charging me stupid amount of money told me it was under warranty. I was able to take my car in and knew exactly what to tell the mechanic. Aaron was spot on with his diagnoses. I will take my car here every time in the future, nice to know there is somewhere to go that won't rip me off!"
positive,"Great service with a good price! 
My check engine light came on, and it was because something was wrong with the break switch. 
With so many great reviews I saw on here, I decided to come by after work. They didn't have the parts but they ordered it and was able to replace it the very next day. I am very satisfied, thank you!"
positive,"Took my F150 in to change all the fluids in the engine, transfer case, transmission, and rear end differential. Scott the owner took good care of me and they did a great job on the truck. Also It was about $100 cheaper than the quotes i received from other mechanics. Affordable and dependable. 10 for 10."
positive,"This place deserves the 5 star ratings it has received! Fast,fair,and profressional service...In and out in 20 minutes.The muffler itself price was $90 on line.Price charged for muffler and installation was $120(after $10 discount for cash payment). Very pleased,highly recommend and will return. Hint:arrive as close to 8am opening time as possible, and let them know you are paying in cash."
positive,"I had my car repaired here after being in a minor rear end collision.  His insurance company suggested this place and sent an assignment so I could get a quote.

After accepting the quote, I made the appointment with them to bring the car in.  The amount of time they needed was unknown until they pulled off the rear bumper and looked for any hidden damage.

Two days later, I got a call saying my car was ready.  When I picked it up, I was amazed that they had done a detailing of the car after the repairs.

My only problem was lack of communication.  I called the second day and asked for the status.  The person I spoke to said they left a message on my answering machine.  Not true--my machine is disconnected as is that line.  Honest communication is essential for trust and any future business.

EDIT:  After speaking with two people from Gerber, I understand how there was miscommunication possibly caused by my handwriting.  I would recommend Gerber to anyone who needed collision repair.  They are proud of their work!"
positive,"My car lost its transmission fluid a block from these guys while traveling on business in my own car (250 miles from home). They diagnosed a cracked radiator and replaced it a couple of hours before my drive home. I am happy to say I made it without any issues. If I had gotten the discount they quoted, I would have given them a five. Nice work guys and thanks."
positive,"I have to say despite what you may hear about AAMCO Transmissions as a chain company this place is the exception to all that. Do an online search of AAMCO and you will be horrified how many people complain about their bad experiences. However, this place seems to be family operated by great people who actually care about the work they do. My Ford Explorer started having transmission problems so I did a quick search on yelp and found this gem. I was wary of taking my car here since I heard so many bad things about this company, but after reading so many great reviews of this particular store I was enticed! The staff are super friendly and were quick to answer all my questions. The turn around time took about a day to get it fixed and when I came to pick it up everything worked perfectly. They asked me to check in with them about a week to see if everything was working fine which it was. They also offer warranty for their work. Great shop and excellent service. 5 stars!!!!"
positive,"Another great experience with David @
Formula Euro. My car needed new engine and transmission mounts. David was able to repair the main issue as well as perform any of the required maintenance that my car needed and got me back on the road quickly. I have an 09 Mercedes 320 Blue Tec with 90k miles on it and it runs like brand new thanks to Davids good work! I highly recommend his shop as a better and less expensive alternative to higher priced, impersonal dealerships."
positive,"First off I HATE, I mean really HATE shopping for cars but the worse is dealing with the sales people, sales managers, negotiating, financing, etc etc... but I LOVE the way I was treated at Tempe Honda! 

I could not have asked for a better experience, from the phone call to the test drive to negotiating and beyond the service I received from Tempe Honda was extraordinary! 

I was looking for a commuting car for my hour plus daily commute and after months of research I decided on a 2017 Honda Civix EX-T. It was a great decision! I was looking for a manual transmission which was pretty hard to find, but I could not justify on spending the extra money for an automatic. I found only a couple in the state and when I went to Showcase Honda first they were very pushy and a month later they still call me almost daily! Save a headache and avoid Showcase Honda at all costs, their Internet prices are very deceptive! I found another at Tempe Honda and went in within an hour to test drive it. The salesman was very respectful and not pushy at all, I even asked him at one point during the drive if he was the person I was dealing with or was he just along for the test drive. When we got back I told him about my trade-in and what I wanted to pay for the Honda EX-T, I negotiated with him and the sale manager and got very close to my number. I could go on and on, but just know that you are in good hands here and I would come back. 

Thanks Tempe Honda! I highly recommend you to anyone looking to buy a Honda! I love my new Honda EX-T!"
positive,It was amazing! They told me about some coupons and deals and a $160+ transmission fluid flush and refil went down to $107. They were so nice and have me a free car wash as well. I am definitely going to go back for sure.
positive,"I brought my car into A to Z Auto Care after my check engine light came on. Tom and his staff ran a diagnostic check on my car for FREE and recommended exactly what I would need to fix the issue at a more than reasonable price. I did not feel pressured whatsoever to make a decision on the spot. They were quick, efficient, friendly and above all, did a quality job! I will 100% be coming back here with any other auto related issues!"
positive,"We were on a road trip and our check engine light came on. Craig did a free diagnostic for us. Very fast, very professional. If I was in Vegas I would use them in the future!!"
positive,"Once again, saved by Daniel's total car care.  I was driving in central Phoenix and heard a large ""clunking sound"".  You guessed it...I dropped my tranny!  Luckily, Dan's towed me in, served up coffee, replaced the transmission and got me back on the road in less than 5 hours.  And, all at a reasonable price.  Thank you."
positive,"GREAT service; fast diagnostic and friendly people.

I was in town on vacation when my check engine light came on. I called on Saturday morning at 10am and they said to bring it in for a free diagnostic. I arrived at 11am, and by 1130 they had diagnosed a fuel mixture error, probably caused by crap gas I purchased at a truck stop. They reset the error code, clearing the check engine light. 
I paid with only a handshake and a sincere thank you, since it was just a diagnostic on the engine light. Las Vegas Cadillac quoted me $125 to diagnose it, so yay for Aamco's free service.

I've filled up twice since the visit and the error light has not happened again.

Thanks guys! Hopefully the positive yelp will offset my free diagnostic."
positive,"This place is incredible! I was referred here after spending Memorial weekend broken down in Fountain Hills with no transmission shops open. I called on Monday (the holiday) and left a message. Phil returned my call about 7am Tuesday and said they were swamped with vehicles that had been left in his parking lot over the weekend but, after hearing my story he said, ""Come on down. I will keep a bay open for you!""  I immediately called AAA and they were at my hotel in 30 minutes. We pulled into Ken's Transmissions in northeast Phoenix about 9:30 and Phil was waiting, true to his word with a vacant bay waiting. While they were putting my truck on the lift I got on my phone and booked a nearby Scottsdale hotel figuring I would be waiting until the following day for my truck....two hours later I was on my way with a rebuilt transmission installed perfectly and several hundred dollars less than any of the other estimates I received!!  

If you ever have transmission problems and you are anywhere near Phoenix this is, hands-down, the best, most honest, most efficient, and genuinely friendly repair shop I have ever dealt with....no need to look any further!  Call and talk to Phil (602-867-3354)....he will fix you up.

That reminds me, I need to thank Fred for this referral! :))"
positive,"I was having trouble with my car jolting when shifting and didn't know the problem.  I took my car to 2 different repair shops and the Volvo dealer.  None of them could diagnose the problem.  I finally called AAMCO and made an appointment.  They were my last hope.  When I went to pick up my car, I was told that I was 2 quarts low on transmission fluid!  I asked what I owed, because at that point, I was willing to pay just about anything and the reply I received was ""it's alright, we got this"".  What? No one does this...Except these guys did! And they have gained a customer for life.  Can't say enough good things about this place, they are great! Honest and trustworthy."
positive,Great mechanic. You definitely won't overpay for your service. These guys are honest and don't try to rack up the bill for things you don't need. My transmission went out in my car and they fixed it with no problems. Communication could have been a little better but it's only because they're always so busy.
positive,"I've had two separate vehicles with transmissions problems, took the first one, my Yukon in and it came out like brand new, they were so genuine and nice that I took my Explorer to get fixed as well. It's hard finding an honest mechanic shop so I recommend this one for sure."
positive,"Had a muffler repair on a Silverado, had awesome and friendly service! Thanks Will!

- Brad N."
positive,"I usually don't write up reviews as it takes time and effort. However, it would be so unfair and wrong not to leave a well deserved 5 star rating for Carter and his associate Avery. I initially contacted them regarding an overhearting issue with my car. They diagnosed the possible cause which is the failing radiator but did not jump the gun to have it be replaced right away, instead I was advised to observe it first. As I drove the car  around the heatpacked Phoenix summer, it really proves that the  radiator is causing the overheating. I had it serviced by them, drove the car purposely in the peak of the ambient temp, no overheating occured. Now here is the interesting part, since I am so lucky enough that the car I bought has so many major problems, within the day, I noticed that I might have a malfunctioning transmission. I called in Carter again, relayed the situation and asked if he could further assist. He very willingly referred me to his trusted colleague who specializes in handling transmission problems. As of this writing, my car is still giving me headaches and still draining my bank, but the point is that I am amazed how professional, fair and honest the company is being run. Kudos to the team!"
positive,Eddie from the service department provided excellent customer service. I needed an external transmission cooler put on my 2011 Nissan Rogue and Eddie had great intentions to provide what I needed at the best value. Ask for Eddie!
positive,"I have never had such a great experience in a car dealership in my life. 

Just a brief back story - I was in the market for a new SUV after I had issues with my Nissan and their CVT transmission. I had my eye set on one particular vehicle, had to have it .. couldn't get it. I didn't need a new SUV anytime soon, unless I planned to take another road trip so I decided I would just wait on it. My boyfriend suggested I just test drive the Tiguan (even though I didn't REALLLLY care for the exterior of the suv based on photos) BUT, for him, I told him we can go test drive but I'm OVER sitting in dealerships. (We visited SEVERAL the entire past week.) 

Matt immediately helped us when we appeared on the lot &also grabbed Louis to help us with some questions since Matt had previously been in service and wanted to make sure we got the correct info. 

I literally felt like home when I was talking with these guys. Louis even let my boyfriend take out his own personal car to drive it - who does that?! We had fun! :) 

They presented me with a fabulous price for the vehicle - which hadn't been done the entire last week. They worked with me a little more to find a happy comfortable compromise and truly did whatever they could to earn my business - even dropping off my new Tiguan to my work the following day! 

I can't thank Matt enough for how awesome he was during this entire process. I'm not an easy decision maker; I had my fair share of questions and concerns and he made sure I got every answer (some even 2..3...4 times!) and truly made this experience easy! 

SO happy with my new 2017 Tiguan!"
positive,Went to the mex mufflers on Stoughton road and Ivan did a great job! The job is great especially for the price!
positive,"This is my third review of this location. I continue to have great service from this Pep Boys. Fairly recently (1 year? 2 years) ago I bought a new ""pro Start"" battery from them for my occasional-use second car. this winter, it had trouble starting and I kept having to charge the battery. Since it is a second car, I never actually addressed it, just charged it as needed. 

This week it did it to me again, and after charging it, I brought it in to them. Although it started the car just fine while I was there, they put it in their machine, which flagged the crank amps as low, and that it should be replaced -- and so they did. Free of charge. 

Their ""Pro Start"" house brand battery has a 2 use free replacement warranty, followed by another 5 years of a traditional pro rata warranty. I was in, tested, replaced, and out in less than 10 minutes. They looked the paperwork up on line, so I didn't even have to show a receipt or anything. 

That was the first time I've every had a battery warranty turn out to be anything more than a small discount on buying a new one. I got a brand new battery for free -- hassle free. 

The leaks they fixed (transmission, oil, tire) all remain fixed and the suspension they rebuilt remains solid. 13 years and 120k miles -- and the car runs like new and more dependable than the day I bought it (it had a rough first year with warranty service)."
positive,"I would give this place 10 stars if I could! After an unexpected issue with my BMW I was panicked and needed my car repaired quickly. Mike helped me out and was absolutely amazing! My car was in and out of the shop in less than 48 hours, and the fix was affordable! So nice to finally find an honest hard working European car shop!  Will definitely be bringing my car back for any future service, Thanks again!!!"
positive,"Yesterday was my second transaction with Affordable Muffler, and both were positively stellar.  The first time was several years ago...the muffler had rotted out on my 2007 RAV4 and Toyota wanted $1500 to replace it.  Because they claimed the entire exhaust from the end of the collector back was one piece, so it would require all that piping plus the catalytic converter.

I looked online and saw that there was an aftermarket muffler on Amazon for $79.  Loads of reviews saying it was the bee's knees, fit perfectly, blah blah blah.  All it took was someone to cut out the old one and weld in the new one.  I stopped by Affordable Muffler and the guy said no problem.  ""How's $100 sound?""  Sounds like SOLD to me.  I was in and out in 45 minutes.

Yesterday I backed out of my driveway with a ton of snow on the ground and then I started noticing a clunking sound.  Pulled over and saw that the exhaust was broken off at a flange several feet in.  The snow I backed over must've grabbed that pipe and twisted it.  There was rust, so it was obviously already weak, but the snow-surfing must've finished things.  I sawed the hangers off to free the hanging piece, threw it in the back and headed for Affordable.

The waiting area was empty when I walked in.  My car was on the rack by the time my ass hit the seat in the waiting area.  30 minutes and $100 later, I was out the door.

While I was there I heard the guy on the phone with another customer, who's car was in their shop.  She must've been really giving him crap, but he was extremely courteous and professional, listing all her options and giving his recommendation, but ultimately leaving it up to her.  I was impressed.  Later he interacted with a young woman in the waiting area who obviously didn't have much money.  Her car had failed the state emissions inspection and after reading her paperwork from the inspection, the Affordable guy told her it sounded like she needed a tune-up, not a replacement catalytic converter.  He further told her that AM doesn't do tune-ups, but offered a recommendation for a regular mechanic that does.

Now, he could EASILY have sold this girl a new catalytic converter (which aren't cheap) and then sent her on her way.  In fact, she asked him to, but he patiently explained that the way her car failed the test, it probably wasn't a bad converter.  Ultimately she left and he made no money, even though her car was up on the lift and a mechanic spent around 20 minutes looking it over while she came to her decision.  So actually the shop LOST money, but they didn't charge her a thing.  That's integrity.

So...integrity, speed, excellent pricing...what else could you want in a place like this?  I will say that the chairs in their waiting area are super uncomfortable, and my back ached the rest of the evening...but I was in an auto mechanic's shop, not a spa, so I'm not taking a star off for that.  Further, there was no television or music in their waiting area, which I think of as WONDERFUL.  I avoid television like the plague and I HATE when I'm in some waiting area and am forcibly raped into watching some horrendous drivel that sucks IQ points from my brain.  Everyone on earth has a smartphone now, so they can watch their choice of programming (or not) in the privacy of their own hand.  Thanks for the peace and quiet, Afforable Muffler!

The only thing to keep in mind with AM is that they're NOT a mechanic shop...they fix exhausts.  Period.  That's what makes them so fast, they're specialized."
positive,"My AC and Heater went out and my check engine light was on. Between Mike, Tom and Jovan they were a dream team. Bumpy beginning but they ended up knocking it out of the park with the mysterious problems my engine was showing. They dug and dug and didn't give up! Can't be more grateful for dedicated individuals!"
positive,"We just wanted to say thank you Scott Harvey and his family run business, they got us in and out so fast! We were going through Las Vegas on our way to Denver when we had what we believed to be transmission problems..  
We were considering renting a truck to pull our trailer so we could continue on our way while we left our truck for repairs.  As it turned out it was not the transmission but the coil pack which caused it to be misfiring. They knew our dilemma put the truck on their scope, found out the issues fixed it and we were out in less than an hour and back on the road, great service!"
positive,"Inherited a 1979 450 SL that had not been driven in a couple years and barely started. I live in CO and needed the car road worthy quickly. Ryan worked some magic and got me in quickly. The car needed a fair amount of work to say the least and it was impressive how fast they did everything from engine to brakes to transmission. The shop stuck to the estimate and fixed a couple things they found getting into it as agreed to do. I drove the car 900 miles through the mountains and it ran like a champ. Not a fancy shop, but who cares when the service is excellent. Hope I can find a shop as good here in CO!  Thank you gentleman."
positive,"I am very impressed with the way Tempe Honda operates! Talk about a well oiled machine. You guys are clean, friendly, and efficient. When I showed up for my appointment I met with Jason. Jason was awesome! He made me feel comfortable as we discussed the airbag recall, software update, and anything else I might need taken care of while I was there. I could really feel that Jason had a genuine desire to make sure that my car and I were recieving the very best care and that all of our needs were being met. Jason explained I would receive a call, later in the day, to let me know my car was ready for pick up. Next Jason walked me to the sign up sheet for the shuttle. Shortly after signing up I was greeted by Marc. What a great guy! He drove me home and promptly picked me up when I called to let him know my vehicle was ready for pick up. Thanks for the great conversation and safe trip to and from my home! Also my vehicle was ready sooner than expected but Jason told me I could pick it up at my earliest convenience! When I got back to the service department to pick up my car Jason complimented me for keeping up on the mantainence. As he went over the multi-point inspection he showed me that everything was in the green except the accessory drive belt which is starting to show signs of wear. He had brought this to my attention over the phone, giving me a price quote and offered to take care of it for me but I respectfully declined. Otherwise he said the car was clean and everything was good to go! Thank you Jason for taking good care of me during my visit. Let's not forget about Ashley who did a superb job taking my appointment over the phone! She was upbeat and friendly. And last but not least Ivan! I must say you guys are lucky to have such a determined and enthusiastic sales consultant down there at Tempe Honda. Ivan was quick to see that there was a 2012, black, Fit, with a manual transmission in for service that matched a brand new one on the show room floor. I know that when Ivan connected the dots he had big plans for me but unfortunately my wife and I are not in the market for a new car. I do admire his determination! All in all my visit to Tempe Honda was a great experience and I thank you for that! I hope my feedback helps you the same way you helped me."
positive,Great place to get any car repaired! They kept us informed every step of the way through text messages. My car was repaired fast and looks better then when we bought it! Highly recommend!
positive,"I needed a car for my daughter when her car's transmission went out. My wife and I looked at cars online and found a used car that would be suitable, so my daughter and I went to the dealership. They handed me off to a young girl who was obviously new to sales and when I started asking some tough questions I was approached by a supposed ""sales manager"". This ""meathead"" looked like he was auditioning for the TV show Jersey Shore. He proceeds to ask me why I won't sign a hand written note saying I will be there for the next 2-2.5 hours. I told him I want them to speed up their process and he says I'm being aggressive. What a moron. What kind of sales manager insults a customer who's there ready to buy? This guy tells me they sell between 200-300 cars a month and then 2 sentences later says he sells 20 cars a day. Does he not know how to do math? 20 cars a day equals around 600 cars a month. He'll be lucky if he's still there in another year. I was then approached by another guy, Chris McKee, and this review is about him, not the dealership. Chris and I worked through the numbers and discussed what needed to be discussed. Chris was good and Midway Nissan is lucky to have him. If the ""Real"" sales manager ever reads this review, I have some advice, get your act together already. Stop putting kids with no people skills in positions of power. If you go to Midway Nissan, ask for Chris McKee, he's a good guy and will help you out, while being friendly and respectful. Thanks Chris."
positive,"Had the dreaded check engine light shine it's ugly head right before I had to renew my registration. I was also in between jobs so money was not abundant.
I had one shop try to diagnose and resolve this issue but they didn't seem to know how to. Frustrated, I took my vehicle to Kelly Clark. Very professional, resolved the issue quickly. Honest & friendly, I would highly recommend them."
positive,"Will definitely use again! 
Carter responded to our quote so quickly, at half the price of anywhere else we'd looked! And continued to email quickly back and forth answering all my questions.

We originally requested a quote for spark plugs, since the check engine light service from Autozone told us this was the issue. Carter quoted us for spark plugs but said they'd do a diagnostic check first to make sure that was the real issue. Stephen, the mechanic Sent to us, was very polite and thorough! It ended up not being the spark plugs so it was even cheaper than expected (always a good thing!!!) Stephen even walked my husband through how to avoid the problem in the future, something most garages won't do for you!

We will use their service again & definitely recommend to friends & family."
positive,"Used them for the second time this morning to service my father in law's car. They have a reputation for their honesty and spending your money like it's their own and that proved true once again. 
Showed me a slow fluid leak in the transmission but said just to keep a watch on it to get worse and then do something about it then. 
The customer who came in right after me was there for five minutes and they came and asked him if he was having a problem with his brakes because he still had some life on them before needing replaced. They showed him what they were talking about and sent him on his way - no diagnostic charge or anything. 
My other experience with them was when they stayed late on Good Friday to fix my dad's car who had just come in from out of town. After replacing his water pump, they told him the cooling fluid they used was a lifetime fluid and not to ever let anyone sell him on replacing it. 
I don't own a Toyota or Lexus, but if I did I would take it nowhere else but here."
positive,"Wow! Honest, Friendly and get the job done with no BS. I brought my car in with a check engine light on and a list of issues came up. (I have been out of work and couldn't afford getting the issues fixed until now and still on a budget.) They did not try to up-sell me anything. Just told me the issues and how much to fix them. I went to 3 other shops and most quoted me almost 2-4 times the amount they Jack and Sons quoted me, great pricing! I am so pleased with their services.

I will recommend them to my family and friends for now on and they have become my permanent mechanics. Thank you Eddie and Kenny and crew."
positive,"My engine check light came on. I hate when car problems happen. My old friend recommended this place and here was where I went. I needed an oil change and they took care of that quite quickly as well as looking at why my check engine light came on. The guys were very knowledgeable and told me to bring it back in if the light came back on. Overall, even though I hate taking my car in because it is such a nuisance, I felt that the work and service charges were very reasonable. Besides, who doesn't love the cool logo and the cool panda wall? They did an awesome job with their advertisement. It is in the same shopping center as 168, so while you are waiting on your car you can grab a bite to eat. That is a win win for me."
positive,"My wife and I recently were met by a severe family medical emergency resulting in my wife needing to relocate temporarily, as a result of this many things were in chaos, one of which is that my son's car's AZ registration expired and it failed smog, meaning in addition to everything else, living out of a hotel and all that entails, we were renting a car every day or paying $40 for a ride share.  This was unexpected not something we were emotionally prepared to deal with.  I went online and found Carlife, read reviews, and made the call, the rest was simply the best auto repair experience we have ever encountered.  From the moment I spoke to them I could tell this would be different and in a good way, they set up the tow to have the car towed from Deer Valley to their shop on a Saturday, BTW I highly recommend Dave he was great, there were issues when he went to put the car on the truck, he never wavered and was able to get the car to Carlife just after close and they waited for the car to ensure it was put away properly.  They had given me a quote and a contingency, the contingency being that it was possible if they replaced one sensor it might turn off the lights but it might still fail inspection, or after a small amount of driving the other sensors may fail as well, so I knew what might occur. 

They repaired the car, I picked it up, took it to a smog inspection station and it failed not because of the repair but because I didn't allow the computer to reset, then the inspector informed me the check engine soon light was lit as well.  I took the car back to Carlife explained what had happened, they took it in almost immediately to look and sure enough the other sensor codes came on, again, no problem I had been told that this might occur.  They quoted me for what needed to be done and told me that once it was done they would smog it and deliver it to my wife, who is still living out of a hotel.  Today I called and again spoke to Elsie to get status, I was blown away, not only was the car repaired, it passed smog and was ready to be delivered to my wife.  Then I asked about the cost, I knew approx what it was going to be, Elsie then said that when they actually went in to do the work that it did not require all the work they had expected from the error codes and the price was nowhere near what they had told me originally in fact it was only about 25% of the quoted repair price, they could have done all the work, I would have paid without question and been none the wiser and been happy (I'm 1200 miles away) but they didn't and frankly that's not exactly the norm, unfortunately, in the auto repair industry.  I am thrilled to offer my sincerest recommendation for this company, from the owner, the office, to the mechanics (one of whom I also had the pleasure to meet) they were all wonderful.  Thanks to all of you for making an incredibly difficult situation a little better by going the extra mile.  


Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a blessed & joyous Holiday season"
positive,found this place close to my house and blindly went there.  was very pleased with robby and the work that was done on the transmission of my pickup truck.   i would highly recommend this business.  robby is honest and straight forward.
positive,"I came here for routine transmission work on a Monday morning. I had originally been quoted $185, and was going to use the 10% off check in offer. I dropped it off at 9AM, and was told it would be ready by 12:30 or 1PM. To my surprise, it was ready by 11, and they only charged $99. So refreshing to come to a place where I know they have my best interest in mind. Definitely coming back for all of my future work!"
positive,I just bought a 2004 Jaguar from Florida and it arrived with a check engine light.  I brought it to Delphino who has solved complex problems my vehicles have had in the past.   I asked Dephino to order spark plugs and he suggested to first check to make sure they were required to fix the check engine light.   Delphino listened to the engine and knew right away the real problem was a crankcase valve.   He repaired it for less than $200  which I estimate is 1/10 what others would have charged me.   This is the 5th car of min Delphino was able to troubleshoot and repair.  He knows how to source the best price on parts and his mechanics are under his tight supervision.   Delphino's years of experience allows him to provide the best service at the best price.   Thank you Delphino for getting my car thru smog.   I now have my license plates and a big smile.
positive,"I just want to say I received the best service in the state of Arizona from Tom. He was so sweet and clear and bout what was going on with my car. Me as a single mom unsure of the damage my car would cost me, nor am I car/ maintenance savy. But Tom was extremely a blessing! Best service period. I am a manager at Amazon so I know how Customer Obsession goes and Tom you are it!!! Thank you to you and your team... even though my transmission crapped out that $5000 sticker shock did not faze me at all...."
positive,"The owner of this business is truly a man of his word. We bought a beautiful 2012 BMW 740I for our daughter, and it had some minor transmission problems which Joe fixed as he stated he would in his warranty. Really appreciate an honest local businessman who has great vehicles, very helpful staff, and he stayed at the dealership really late to answer all of my questions and make sure we were comfortable with everything. 

Can't say enough great things about them! I will definitely be buying my next car here, as we never buy brand new cars. Joe, as long as you are there you will have customers for life! 

Collette Warren and Michael Osteen"
positive,"The first car I test drove had transmission issues... It wouldn't shift gears and we had to immediately turn around and go back to the dealer. Scary thought since all used cars at this dealer are supposed to have gone through rigorous inspection. I purchased a 2012 Ford Focus with 37k miles on it. It was a great deal compared to other places, and it was nice not to have to haggle price. It's been working perfectly so far other than the windshield wipers already needing replaced after having it for a week and the lack of an owner's manual. Jessica helped me with the selection process, and she was excellent. When they brought my car around for me to take it, she had them clean it a second time because it was not up to her standards. Anthony helped me pick a repayment plan. He was pushy to the point of almost disrespecting my wishes. Angie helped with signing the paperwork. 90% of what she said was complaining about her job, although she was very thorough about explaining what I was signing."
positive,"They were able to quickly solve my clutch issue for $1000 on my Saturn Ion that a previous mechanic failed to fix after multiple tries.

For transmission and clutch issues I highly recommend this establishment. Don't bother going anywhere else. They've been in business for a long time and only do transmissions and clutches."
positive,Came by this morning because my check engine light came on and long story short I don't need to have anything done to the car (right now) but they were SO quick and friendly. Other auto repair shops often guilt trip you into unnecessary repairs or you leave with even more questions but I felt so at ease when I left. Will definitely come back if I need any repairs!
positive,"It's hard to pick a TRUSTED transmission repair shop. I was refered to On the Go by another auto mechanic. The owner cares about providing good service at a reasonable price. He provides free estimates, no hassles, no high pressure sales, just good reliable service. His work is completed on time and at or below his estimate. You wont find a better more trustworthy shop in the West Valley."
positive,Great honest dealership. Earnhardt is scamming people and posting false reviews ripping people off. A man named John had to pay 10k and come back two days later for his check engine light being on. Go to Desert 215 they are a good honest dealership.
positive,"Great customer service, honest regarding your vehicle and fair pricing. My appointment for transmission fluid change was on time without an issue."
positive,"WOW!  What incredible customer service.  Even though they were busy and it is Friday afternoon Scott took the time to look at my car and give me a detailed explanation of why my check engine light was on and what my options are to fix the issue.  He was so honest and helpful - giving me the pros and cons of each option, and all in a way that I could understand.   A friend had recommended Sunland Auto and I can see why.  They really care about their customers and doing a great job that they can stand behind.  Thank you Scott for taking such great care of me, I will be back."
positive,"Just picked our car up from Ultimate Collision today. I can't say enough about this location! Every time something new happened (adjuster came out to look at car, parts came in, etc) they called to update me with what was going on. I never felt like I was in the dark. They worked as quickly as possible to get our car back to us ASAP while doing a great job! They even detailed the interior! I will definitely be recommending them to anyone who needs their car repaired after an accident."
positive,"Went in to get a flow master on my car and was very satisfied. The welding was very clean and neat they took their time to ensure the muffler was on right and Paul was very Polite as was everyone else there. It was also a great price and was out of there in about 45 minutes, amazing shop"
positive,"This place is a hidden gem in the valley. Toyauto is very affordable as well as trustworthy. The waiting room is nothing too special but who cares with the speed they work on your automobile for the price. 

Here's a tip. If your in for an oil change they will rotate tires for a very low price. Don't overpay for rotations at other places."
positive,"AAMCO took care of my 36 year old transmission in record time.  If no frills, family oriented business and service is what you're after, then this is the place to go. Buying a replacement transmission wasn't an option for me (they don't make them) but Kyle and his staff were more than happy to fix the problem with mine. Their care and attention to detail did not go unnoticed, and I will bring all future driveline related business to them. Thanks"
positive,"Super fast, friendly honest service! These guys are amazing. I have used these guys 2 times now for routine maintenance on my car. They took great care of me each time. When my check engine light came on, joey worked me right in, checked it out and fixed the problem at no cost, as it was just a loose hose. Excellent, professional and super kind! I will never take my car anywhere else."
positive,"Yes they are honest. But also quick and friendly. I didn't have a mechanic but my check engine light came on. Although my car was driving fine I needed this dealt with right away because I needed to get it smoged which you can't do with the light on. 

I don't know if it was because it was Black Friday but I called several mechanics and was told they were too busy. But when I called these guys they told me to bring it in to them. And I'm glad I did. 

They did a diagnostic test and the repair in about an hour. They were very reasonably priced. My charge for everything was about $200. They charged $75 for the diagnostic test but deducted it from the repair. 

I will definitely see them again next time any auto repair I might nee"
positive,"I had some recall work done at the local Toyota dealer and as part of that they perform this multipoint vehicle inspection.  So they present me with this list of things they recommend I fix.  I had a right front inner leaking CV boot ($450), fuel injection decarbonization ($160), power steering flush ($140), and spark plugs ($150).  This is my only car and I rely on it to drive 50 miles round trip to work during the week so I don't take repair issues lightly.

I decided to do the spark plugs on my own since it's so easy on my car (Scion).  For $29 and 20 minutes of my time I solved that issue.  

Based on the reviews on Yelp, I went into Sunland to see if they had a better deal on the CV boot.  I didn't even mention the other issues as I couldn't even afford to fix the CV boot issue.  Scott calls back and says the CV boot is fine.  It's losing no more lubricant than any other CV boot on any other car.  It wasn't torn at all.  So there's nothing to do there.  At this point I mention the other things the dealer told me.  I wound up not needing them but Scott did recommend a transmission flush since my fluid was running black (I wonder how the dealer missed that?).

I'm glad I stumbled onto this shop!  It's so refreshing to find an honest mechanic who isn't trying to just add on a bunch of things to a repair bill (especially on an older car like mine).

Total savings: $750.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sunland!  I would give them 6 stars if I could."
positive,"Years of reliable, dependable service at reasonable prices (almost always) for my little Scion.  I heard about this place from a friend who was a long-time customer, and he told me, ""I trust Dale Husband.""  After years of bringing my car here for everything from oil changes to several [x]0,000 mile service, I trust them, too.  

They've helped me find cheap parts on eBay, advised against any service that I didn't really need, completed the job in the time they promised, etc.  They're always friendly, and I've never had an issue with a single job they've done.

I recently tried out another place near my house (I gave in to the temptation of being able to walk home) and it just made me appreciate Husband's more.

NOTE: They don't rotate tires or do alignment here."
positive,"Yesterday evening our LR was fully packed and we were ready to move out of state. We stopped for one last photo in front of our old home and our LR stalled. It took minutes before we could get it running again and as it was already past 8PM it was clear that our move would need to be delayed. This morning we called Rov-n-Techs (formerly Rover Techs) and they said they would do their best to fit us in. We have been to them a few times but fortunately the LR has run well so we aren't regular customers. As such, we didn't expect much but we were hopeful. We showed up and the guys were in the middle of removing a transmission from another vehicle and weren't sure if they could get a look at it before lunch. We totally understood and were just grateful that they could look at it today. To our surprise they not only squeezed us in, but they also worked on our LR while it was still hot to ensure they got us out of there before noon. I cannot even begin to express my gratitude and my amazement that these guys would bend over backward to help us, knowing full well we are moving and will no longer be customers of theirs (unless we move back of course). Each experience with them has been positive and without hesitation I would recommend them to anyone and everyone with a Rover. Quality work, ethical business, and exceptional customer service."
positive,"I'm new to Arizona, so I used yelp to find a good auto shop. This place had 93, 5-star ratings and nothing lower than that. I went to this shop asking that he diagnose what I believed to be transmission leak. 

They lived up to their online reputation.  My last oil change at a local joint (see my other reviews) left me with an over-filled transmission and an oil plug that was not not screwed in properly. I lost 3 quarts of oil, but I was thinking I had a transmission leak because the oil change shop told me it was a half quart low. 

Scott was great. He drained the extra trans fluid and added 3 quarts of oil for $11

$11!!!!  Are you kidding me?!? The oil alone cost that much!

I brought my truck up after Scott gave me the good news at 2 PM and asked him for an oil change which he completed the same day for $31. 

I know a good man when I meet one. I have a new trusted mechanic. :-)"
positive,"I started searching for a new mechanic after feeling like the mechanic I had been going to for more than 10 years was ripping me off. I found PBS on Yelp. I took my car there after being told by my previous mechanic that I would need rear brakes in three months. I took my car there and dropped it off expecting to have to have them replaced. After about 20 minutes the owner called and said my brakes didn't need to be replaced, just cleaned. Instead of the $300 I was expecting it cost me $59 and was ready in an hour. I was so pleased that I took my other car down to have it checked because the check engine light was on. They did a diagnostic check and determined that it was because I hadn't tightened my gas cap enough. They reset the system and sent me on my way free of charge. I have sent several people there and they have been equally pleased. I have definitely found my new mechanic."
positive,"Just had my car towed in to Wiegand Brothers after being told after 3 separate assessments that my ""transmission was shot"".  Wiegand Brothers was recommended by 2 other mechanics as ""being the best in the business.""  While I was prepared to bite the bullet of the high cost of a new transmission, I was pleasantly surprised when I was told that the transmission was fine and rather I had a broken axle.  The axle was repaired at an incredibly reasonable price!  I am so happy and pleased with their work I would recommend them to anyone!"
positive,"Service Department Review: After reading the negative reviews, I decided to memorialize my experience at Desert Audi  I've owned a variety of cars over the years (all imports). I've always used the dealership's garage with varying amounts of success. Desert Audi has been a real standout. In ten years, I've never had a problem with the service department, not one. The staff has always been polite, courteous, and reasonable. There were instances they could have really stuck it to me with incidental charges, service fees, and unnecessary repairs. They never did. In fact, I occasionally ask for extra work, and they try really hard to talk me out of it. That's never happened before.

Here's what I've learned about getting along with the dealership service department (in general not necessarily just Audi):

1) Choose your service advisor wisely. They're all good, but some are better. You can change advisors but work with yours a few times before changing. It takes time to develop a working relationship especially when you might only see this person once a year. Find a groove with your service advisor and EVERYTHING will go much more smoothly. 

2) Prices are negotiable (mostly). The bigger the repair; the more room you have to negotiate. You can try asking for a discount on your oil change or annual service, but I wouldn't hold my breath. I'm talking about high dollar value non-warranty repairs.

3) You have options beyond AutoNation. Findlay Audi in Henderson is full service and can perform factory warranty repairs (extended warranty repairs in most cases must be done by the issuing dealer). Every once in a while I have work done at Findlay. Not because it's cheaper but just to remind Desert Audi that I can spend my money elsewhere (helps with item #2). For non-critical out of warranty repairs, consider getting a second opinion at one of the independent repair shops in town. Sure, you may pay an hour of labor for the diagnostic but on a $5,000 transmission repair I think it's worth it.

4) Be nice! It costs you nothing to be nice to the service staff. You'll find them much more accommodating if you stay calm, cool, and collected.  Yes, they understand you're on a schedule, have to get to work, pick up the kids, etc. They have jobs and families too. Yes, you may be dealing with a bad employee or a good employee having a bad day. Getting upset, as natural as it may seem, does not get your car fixed. #4 is probably the hardest item to digest, but it is the most useful to a successful relationship with your dealership service department."
positive,"On September 25, 2019 I purchased my 4th Honda from Findlay Honda.  I have been a Honda owner for years and it was a no brainer to come back to Findlay because I have always had a great experience with them.  I was shopping for a newer (used) vehicle for my daughter after learning that her Ford Focus was starting to have mechanical issues with the transmission due to a Ford recall that Ford kept hush-hush about from the general public.  Turns out that her specific model and another Ford model had the same transmissions installed in them and they both have a manufactures defect that was not shared with the public.  If you knew of this defect (as a customer) then Ford would fix it for free.  Learning this information was the straw that broke the camels back with me in regard to owning a Ford product, and for the safety of my child, it was time to get her out of that vehicle and into a Honda.  Honestly wish I never bought the Ford Focus to begin with.  

Through crunching all the numbers, Findlay wasn't going to give me a whole lot for her trade in due to such a defect, plus there was some minor cosmetic damage to the front due to a collision.  However, it was suggested to me that we take the vehicle to Carmax (right down the road) and they would buy the car and give me much more for it than Findlay could.  I took that advice and Carmax gave us nearly $2000 more with purchasing it outright; cosmetic issues and manufactures issues included.

Prior to coming to Findlay, we found 2 cars on their website that we were interested in.  When I called the dealership, Nancy answered the phone, and I was transferred to Edith in internet sales and she couldn't have been more helpful and professional.  The first choice that we wanted had just been sold a few hours before we called, but our second choice was still there, and at the time of our call, the car was up on the rack getting serviced and classified as a Certified Used Honda vehicle.

We did the paperwork anyway, prior to test drive, just to guarantee that the vehicle wouldn't be sold.  Upon our approval and test drive (the next day), we were given the Carfaxx Report and the vehicle maintenance history of the car.  No accidents were reported and the people who owned the car before our purchase took such good care of the vehicle, that it was a no brainer that we made a good choice.  My daughter was now going to be driving a 2017 Honda Accord Sport, white in color, tinted windows, weather tech floor mats, and a customized dashboard cover.  All of which were purchased and installed by the previous owners.  We got a great deal on her (newer) Used Certified Honda.  If you know anything about the Honda brand, is that Honda's will run forever as long as they are taken care of!

Finally, I want to thank everyone who was involved in the entire process from start to finish:  Nancy the receptionist who answers the phones, Edith Thearts in Internet Sales, Donald Baker our salesman (ask for him!  He's a good dude!), our Desk Manager Sarah Gallegos, and Chris Jacobsen in finance.  Even though we came in with our own financing, Chris is the guy you still have to sign all your paperwork with and talk with about extended coverages.  Everyone at Findlay are constant professionals, which is why I will always return to Findlay Honda for all my service needs and car vehicle purchases.  

Thanks Findlay Honda!  You are all amazing!"
positive,"Amazing from beginning to end! 

I was in a collision recently. My boss referred me to Las Vegas collision center, because that's where he got his car repaired. I was hesitant at first....it was so far away from where I reside. It was exemplary customer service. I was impressed with how attentive, kind, and how they worked so expeditiously in getting the process completed. I was greeted with a smile from the Young lady working front desk. She was so patient,kind, and soft-spoken. Made me feel very comfortable with any transactions or any documentation presented , kindly explaining what The next steps were in moving forward. She kindly pointed out beverages and snacks that were complementary as I waited for the inspection of my car to be completed. The office that did not feel cold at all. It was very welcoming and warm. I was greeted by a gentleman making the inspection. He also was very kind and very specific on what he was documenting for my knowledge. He was very open to any questions I had and was able to answer them without making me feel embarrassed to ask. After the inspection was completed, he went over... in detail what was going to be fixed. He was great in communicating with me on specifics on allocating time of when they were going to reach out to me after leaving my car there with them. I appreciated their diligence and obvious customer care. I was amazed on how quickly my car was repaired. It was such a sweet surprise to pick up my car fully detailed, washed from the exterior to the interior. There was a young man with glasses that help me with retrieving my car, opened the car door and asked me to look over the repair...to see if I was fully satisfied with what they have done. He handed me the keys and stood quietly as I overlooked every flawless detail. I've never seen my car look at that new ever! It's obvious that they all take pride in what they do in every aspect. I felt great leaving the parking lot and knew that in the future (if an accident occurred) I will be going to them again.

They also left me with a thank you package, but it's me that should be thanking them! 
Thank You To the staff at Las Vegas Collision Center! 
Since then I've purchased a new vehicle and was wondering if the detailing department would detail my car. I would so make the trip out there... just for the great customer service again!"
positive,"Worked with Jovan to get the air in my car repaired. Turns out I needed a whole new system. He found the unique part, kept me posted on progress and got it done exactly when he said it'd be done! He has exceptional customer service!! Recommended my brother there!!

Needed an oil change. Went to Walmart twice and local auto shop and ALL couldn't help BUT low and behold Jovan got me squared away!!"
positive,"Have been to Jeremy's three times and only paid for help on the last two visits.  The first time he was nice enough to drive my car to experience what I was describing and didn't charge me a dime.  What impressed me was how he remembered me on the 2nd and 3rd visits and when I told him the year, model and colour of my car, he remembered the issue I was having.  Remarkable when you consider the number of vehicles and customers he deals with.  He is great with his staff and I think it says a lot of a person, who when a customer isn't clearly in earshot (but has great hearing), treats their staff with respect and not for show.

I was very happy to find that he was open on Saturdays, when one Friday night I got my first check engine light.  I just dropped in and was prepared to make an appointment and leave, but he found the issue quickly and also pointed out that the necessary new part was only $55 ordered from a local dealer.  I liked that he thought it was important to do the job right and not a quick fix and took a fatherly tone when I inquired about a used part instead of being patient and waiting for the new one.  ""We're not talking about thousands of dollars here"" he says, politely discouraging me from being cheap.  He had the part Tuesday afternoon and I had it fixed the next day.  In the meantime he had my car working and fine for any trips around the city I needed to make.  I asked him about rims I liked on other models and if he ever sees any for sale, which he would remember on my next visit and was going to trade with me, meaning I'd not be stuck with the old rims I no longer needed and having to pay the full cost of the new set.  He'd have no trouble selling those rims on Craigslist for much more than he was offering me.  I think he enjoyed my enthusiasm for my new, old car and wanted to help me fix it up.  In the end my existing rims were smaller and so he couldn't swap and put my smaller rims on another vehicle.

I bought my car in December and when the a/c wasn't blowing cold air on Easter weekend, I thought I should take it in before it gets really warm.  Considering the age of my car, it would make sense the a/c refrigerant needed to be replenished.  Maybe a hose needed replacing due to a leak.  What Jeremy found was that my a/c was by-passed with a shorter engine belt, avoiding the air compressor, which would likely have made considerable noise if it wasn't working properly.  I would have heard this on my test drive and not bought the car, so this was obviously done to make a sale.  If the dealership didn't do this, it should have been noticed and repaired before the sale since climate control and air-conditioning were advertised as features on the vehicle.  In December, turning the climate control low enough to have the a/c kick in, would have had the car blowing air from outside the car, which was already very cold and I wouldn't have noticed.

Jeremy doesn't deal with the warranty company that provides the warranty for my car, which I completely understand.  Though the warranty was helpful in getting this issue with the a/c fixed at Central Import (around the corner), I've not heard good things about the warranty company online and don't think I'd do business with them either.  If I had the cash I would have just had Jeremy fix it, knowing that it'd be done right, but being out of work, I had no choice but to leave and find a place that would do warranty repairs.

I recommend Jeremy and would take my vehicle back for sure.  Since I started going to Central Import (initially because they deal with the warranty company for me and have been amazing and it's only fair to reward great service with return business) I haven't been back, but regard Jeremy's quality work to be the high standard everyone else is compared to now."
positive,I stopped by this shop this past weekend and got excellence service.  My check engine light was on and Will (The Owner) and his team had it diagnosed and fixed within 4 hours. I will definitely be taking my business to this shop again.
positive,"I went here today because my check engine light was on/off all last week and since I use my personal vehicle for work, I wanted to get it checked out.  I had previously had an idea of what it could be from taking my vehicle to Autozone for an initial diagnosis.  The service manager Steve was very nice and the mechanic Nick was extremely helpful.  They were definitely busy but Nick took his time to really diagnose the problem and then he even came to get me and show and explain what he did in terms I could understand and took the time to answer my questions.   I didn't feel like he was talking down to me as I have felt at other Firestone locations.  I would highly recommend this location!!"
positive,"Amazing, speedy, thorough, compassionate and precise service. Fairly priced; much lower than a dealer for special services such as transmission fluid change in my case. Pay less, get more :) 
I'll definitely be back for further maintenance needs."
positive,"I was driving and my muffler fell off in the middle of the road..after dodging traffic to grab it I went to Midas (nearest garage to where I was) and they gave me an estimate of $1200 and said they needed to order parts so it would be a few days. Feeling pretty bummed out I went to Mex Muffler and in 1 hour my muffler was reattached, the broken parts were fixed and my bill was $280. The work was very high quality and I was given a 1 year warranty on all
Parts. Will definitely be back for all muffler/brake needs...Mex Muffler literally saved me almost $1,000."
positive,"I had just moved to LV and in need for a new mechanic. Just like how I found my last mechanic, whom I stayed with for the past 6 years and who took care of 3 different vehicles in those past years, I search on Yelp. And here I found TLS Auto. Owned by a very nice couple Vanessa and Mike. Super personable. I also like how Vanessa puts a little femininity to the shop as well. Having all guys around can be a little intimidating some times for females in the shop. I called in for a oil changed and also for an engine check light. Mike was kind enough to take a look at my check engine light and tell me the exact diagnosis for free, while other places were quoting me $98 for just a diagnosis. Both Mike and Vanessa informed me not only of the situation but gave me options. Reasonable options. Not once did I feel pressured or obligated to make any immediate decisions. I felt even more comfortable when Vanessa assured me that they will never pressure anyone to doing or spending money they don't need to. Especially if it's something that can be fix at a later time. Unless it is a safety hazard, then they will always advised what's best. I'm so glad I found this place. I even referred my family to go to them now."
positive,"This review is based on phone conversation only. 
I called to ask questions about transmission issues on a 03 Chevy Silverado PU. I spoke with Tom, he was very helpful and offer possible repair scenarios I had not thought of. 
Based on this alone I'll give them a shot."
positive,This is hands down the best transmission shop in las vegas period! There warranty and customer service are outstanding and they always had a answer to every question i had. Will definitely use these guys again and recommend to anyone!
positive,"Phil and his team we're competent and trustworthy. I was told by an repair shop just one block away that I needed a new transmission. Yikes! I brought my 2005 Chevy Suburban Z71 into Ken's Transmissions fully expecting to have to buy a new one. Not! Turns out it was just a speed sensor that was effecting a number of the systems including the transmission's shifting and speed-o. Instead of paying nearly $1,700, I walked out for under $200. If it needed a new transmission I would've trusted them to install it. Thanks guys!!"
positive,"Sunland saved me from the little Pep Boys! Pep Boys fixed my check engine light problem for $600 and the check engine light came back on two days later. Also, the dashboard and shift box lights of my car stopped working after the so-called fix and Pep Boys denied their responsibilities. So, when the check engine light came back on, Pep Boys quoted me another $600 for another fix. No way. I went to Sunland and the fix was only $100. Thank you so much Sunland Auto Service!!!!!!!! If you have doubts, try it at Pep Boys and Sunland for yourself!"
positive,"I can't say enough positive remarks about this business. I had to book an appointment 2 weeks out because they were so busy and now I can see why. Their customer service and expertise exceeds any auto repair shop I've ever been to. 

I brought my car in the other day for an oil change and to see if they could repair a couple issues I'd been having after my check engine light went on. Two gentlemen greeted me when I got in (one of them was Clark), and they listened to the issues I described with my car then went out to inspect it to see what they could find out. They were able to promptly diagnose what they thought the issue was but then they said my car should still be under warranty, so I shouldn't have to pay for the work. I told them I didn't believe it was, but Clark proceeded to call Audi and check on this for me - without me even asking! It turns out, it was still under warranty so I did not need to have them do this work and they were completely honest with me about this. 

Then, however, I told them I'd still like to get an oil change because I couldn't remember the last time I had one done. They also inspected my car to figure this out for me and told me I still had about 4k miles left until I needed one! So..... my ignorance was basically giving them every reason to charge me for an unnecessary service, but they didn't take advantage of this and did everything they could to help me. I am so grateful for their honesty and their impeccable service. I will never go anywhere else now! Thank you so much to AAA and these two men in particular for totally making my day :)"
positive,"I have been going to Samurai Motors for a bunch of years now for the medium repair jobs for my honda civic, my sibling's 1995 Toyota 4Runner to install a PSC power steering pump and a 1.5inch Old Man Emu Kit and they continuously blew my mind. 

Twice, I brought my 1996 Jeep Cherokee for electrical issues.  Surprise, surprise.  They fixed it.  Well, back there again with the Jeep for a leaking transmission oil pan and most likely needs to be helicoil.  I am getting false neutral too so I am going to have them install a transmission oil cooler kit to see if that will fix that problem.  

Samurai Motors is extremely fair from the pricing of the parts, the labor cost is realistic and the turnaround is fine.  I always made a list of what I wanted done on the vehicle and provide most if not all of the parts needed for the job and I can wait a few days so no rush on mine.  

How will this light transmission job be? I am sure that I will be excited as always.  Thank you Tsuyoshi and your team."
positive,"I love these guys. Honest, professional fast and reasonable! I have been taken my older model Mercedes here for the past two years. They have done my transmission service, replaced motor mounts and replaced spark plugs at a fraction of the cost of what the dealership charges and it was done right!!  I try to avoid the high pressure dealership service department unless the repair involves Mercedes computer/electrical chip type issues I can't shop around for. I closely monitor the maintenance on my 10 year old car and learned enough to say that these guys are legit and female consumer approved!!"
positive,"this place is the best, my wife took our 04 duranago to MNKE and they have a laundry list of what was wrong with the car. differential leaking , transmission, air filter needed changing ect ect.
Using Pro break services in the past i had to get a second opinion because i was more than happy with the service provided.. Well after pro break service checked out the durango they had nothing bad to report regarding what MNKE said needed to be done (rip offs), no leaking fluid no problems with transmission... and you know what when i asked how much the inspection was.. FREE! they'll be getting a couple packs of mountain dew as a thank you!
use these guys you wont be disappointed they are not a shady corporation."
positive,"I was referred here by my parents, they rebuilt the transmission in my family's Trailblazer 5 years ago and it's still going strong. I was told by the dealer that my car needed a new Transmission for over $3,000. I took it here and Louie who inspected it, told me that it only needed solenoids in the transmission replaced. He fixed it and saved me over $2,500! Thank you!!"
positive,"My transmission went out in my 2016 Dodge Caravan. My husband and I found this place, as if a miracle, right around the corner from my breakdown. We did not have any clue where to start. We went to this place scared as hell because we have been burned before. 
After 4 days, Israel and his team had us on the road again. We drove it for a few days before writing this review and we are pleased with the service. They have addressed ANY concern we have had on the repair. So far I trust this garage with my van. We use it for rideshare and deliveries for our businesses. 
Thank you so much!"
positive,"I have a 14 year old Jetta that I love, and cannot afford to replace. I've had it about 3 years and the first 2 and a half years were great, but the last 6 months several things have happened. First, it kept stealing and it ended up stranded at yogurtland. My stepdad had recommended I take it to Robbie. It ended up being holes in the hoses, which they fixed. I was a little upset because they sent my step-dad a text (instead of calling me) telling him it was ready on Friday afternoon, which he didn't get till after they were closed, and I had to get up early Saturday before I went to work to pick it up. Then about 3 weeks later, I go to take my kids to school and go to work, and the car won't start. It was totally dead, not even the clicking like my battery was dead. I took it to a different shop that was close to my office. This time it was the ignition switch. After I paid and the guy handed me my keys, he says, ""oh you know you're engine light is on right? It's your catalytic converter, do you want to just leave it here and we'll fix it?"" So why didn't they tell me this before I paid? Because my light wasn't on and they were trying to be sneaky. I was going to just deal with the issue till I could afford the repair, but my A/C had been out for a year and I couldn't deal with another vegas summer without it. I ended up back at Robbie's. I had several things at this point. The A/C, the cat, my front blinker bulb had been out and then started going crazy making noises, and my drivers door window button broke. From the time I told them to go ahead with the repairs when they diagnosed them to when it was ready was only 2 days, and it was only there one day before. All the employees are very friendly and helpful. I was borrowing my grandpa's van while my car was being fixed, and I went over something that tore the underside plastic off. I stopped by and the guys fixed it for me for free, keeping me out of trouble with my mom and grandpa. Now my car is running great, and my ac is amazing!"
positive,"Very happy with Robins Plumbing.  Damon did a great job and provided excellent customer service.  His truck had a transmission problem, causing him to be about 15 min late.  He gave me a ""heads up"" call letting me know of the problem and that he was on his way.  That's the right way to treat customers.

I also met Steve and Stephanie at the office...both very friendly/helpful and professional.    Thanks, Robins Plumbing!"
positive,"I've lived in Las Vegas my whole life.  Seen lots of shops come and go. I've owned a 2001 super duty with a 7.3 diesel in it since it was new.  In 2017 I limped into Mikes shop after a recommendation from a friend.  I had worn out my transmission at about 160K. Mike was able to diagnose the problem and completed the transformation of my truck with a John Wood built transmission (Tow Master).  He also upgraded a bunch of things on my truck that were long overdue and improved the motors longevity.  Mikes work is impeccable and I've noticed along the way that his team has great choices and completed the project exceeding my expectation.  Mikes shop is busy and now I know why.  This year (2019) I took my truck back to and his team added new injectors and turbo.  Again, impeccable work and the truck runs like a champ.  Couldn't be happier and would highly recommend the SuperDutyShop for any of your diesel truck needs.  They do it all and its worth every penny. To all the guys, Mike, Chase, Chris, Dave and the rest of the crew, thank you."
positive,"I have been here a few times in the last year and they have always been friendly and helpful...Worked on the exhaust on my Isuzu Rodeo and then replaced the muffler...Fast, courteous service from Scott the mechanic and Mario the Owner.  would recommend this to anyone who needs exhaust work, an alignment, or any kind of repair work on their vehicle."
positive,"I brought in my Civic 2013 as it had a little issue with smoothness. It had 230,000 miles on it and was still running on original spark plugs. Engine has never been opened yet which shows how well built Honda Civics are. Mileage was 27-40 mpg. Pretty good. (I had always done maintenance at dealer as required by the book.) They changed spark plugs, cleaned and adjusted valves and car is running smooth again. They did say that the ""transmission was starting to act up"" with no explanation about ramifications and options. I wrote them a message asking and they said best options are change with a new transmission at about $5000 or a good 2nd hand for about $2000. They said they don't do rebuilds. Then I got a letter offering a trade-in to avoid costly repairs. I get it this is the business model of Honda. But there are many Honda owners who maintain their cars scrupulously and want to keep it since it is already fully paid for. They don't want to buy another car. Honda should develop another business model for these owners, one that offers repairs/maintenance at a low cost. They can do this by subcontracting build-up repairs to volume specialists operating out of inexpensive locations and low cost structures, either in America or outside. Cost of spare parts are pretty reasonable right now but labor charges of $100-$150 per hour and high administrative costs are untenable. There are many export zone locations in the world offering $15-$20 an hour all in. Transportation costs can be reasonable. This is a big market Honda should not overlook."
positive,I bought a 2001 Mercedes slk 230. I was looking for a good shop that works on Mercedes.   Obviously I dont have a warranty so the dealership was out of the question.   I had someone who owns a Mercedes recommend German Auto.  So far they have worked out great.  There in my neighborhood and the prices are responsible.   So far I've had my oil changed and the radiator flushed.  Tomorrow I'm getting the transmission flushed and the back brake light replaced. I already got a guote so I know what to expect.  Ill let you know how it turns out
positive,"Well, I, like the others came for an oil change. I didn't want to pay full price for a synthetic oil change so did a Google search and here I am. Even came w/ a tire rotation. Not sure how they are able to sell a synthetic oil change for $40 but if it's the real deal I'm not going to be one to complain lol

I was able to make an appointment online, which was nice, and even received a verification call from the shop to let me know they received my request & penciled me in.

The gentleman at the desk that helped me was very nice and pleasant to deal w/. I've now been here about 5 minutes, my truck is already in a bay and a tech is on it. I opted to stay and wait as to secretly watch them from the waiting room. There is a bar right next door which is always a plus when taking your car in for work to help pass the time.

Done! And not too shabby, only 30 minutes and they had me out the door. The did bring my check engine light being on to my attention, i was already aware. I informed him that I had it scanned at Autozone and they said it was the evap error and I changed out the gas cap and now it's intermittent. I told him there was another part my brother-in-law said to replace but couldn't remember. He did some code searching and we figured out the part. He looked it up and found 4 stores that carried it locally. He then looked and said it's about $100 + about $40 for labor but I should do a diagnostic on it to be sure that's it. He did inform me if I did the diag and got the work done there w/ their parts they would put the diag fee towards the work which works for me. The last thing I felt was pressured to move forward w/ any of the work suggested.

No extra secret fees when I went to pay or shady ""this is broke"" none sense, just tax.

Not sure if they are now under new management or something but I received completely different service than all the reviews I read on here. I am 110% pleased w/ this location and their employees."
positive,"The very best in class service and experience. Integrity is their middle name. They hold themselves accountable to platinum customer service and value and embrace a philosophy of generously giving back to the community . Champ and Heather are a husband and wife dynamic duo who take pride in working hard to earn a solid reputation of trust that is second to none. A rare gem to find in the auto repair industry. From oil changes to transmissions repairs, they have the right answers to meet and exceed expectations for any auto repair need and are consistent in their delivery every single time. Need I say more? The best!!"
positive,"Brought my car in for a check engine light inspection in regards to my exhaust, even though I was running a few minutes late the appointment I was still able to get in and out in a matter of minutes."
positive,"Stopped by to get my check engine light checked out. I was able to drop my car off with Craig so he could take a look at what was going on. Less than a couple hours later he gave me a call with what he found as well as his estimate. The estimate he gave me was very reasonable as well, I didn't have that uneasy feeling I usually get from a shop. 
I wasn't able to pick up my car before they closed shop, so they were nice enough to hold my car inside the shop so it was safe over night. When I stopped in the next day I was in and out. Paid my bill and I was done! 
Craig was overall really helpful and polite. I most likely will be back for my brakes when the time comes for both of my vehicles!"
positive,"It was affordable for starters. I wanted to do a Muffler, resonator delete. The knowledge of the team there made you feel comfortable that I chose them to work on my car. He works works with customers every step of the way and lets you know what he wants to do and how much it will cost you before he begins the work. There is no shady work at this fine establishment. 

I went in for a muffler and y-pipe delete. I received strong recommendations and honest feed back when telling him exactly what i wanted. If he didnt think it was right he would let me know and suggest better alternatives.  I have a newer car than most of the cars he worked on throughout the day and he made me feel as such. He took his time and did an amazing job. Ive been driving it for almost a week and my car sounds phenomenal. I turned heads before but now im breaking necks."
positive,"Ohh man were do I begin. This place has made an everlasting impact on my impression of body shops. I can truly say I'm thankful for all the hard work of all the employees. I brought in my poor car (Jasmine) to be serviced after being rear ended. As I entered the facility I was greeted with warm smiles by 2 beautiful ladies by the name of Lupe and Priscila. They were profesional, courteous and eloquently provided me all the information I needed to get my car repaired. Ms Angelica texted and called me almost daily with updates letting me know the status of my supplemental claim with USAA and repairs to my car. Lady Lupe made water into wine by getting everything taken care of and working tirelessly to extend the car rental. Señorita Priscila went out of her way to provide me a ride to the nearest rental car place. During every visit she treated me as good as the last from being offered coffee, water to some mouth watering chocolate bars. My car was as good as new. The damages were as if a magician struck a wand and made it all disappear. I no longer had worries. They even went as far as to remove paint from damages I had, not related to my accident. WOW. So if your having a hard time deciding the best body shop, look no further! This place not only meets quality standards they exceed them. Thank you for being a part of my life. The values of integrity of your company are unquestionable.  Praise be"
positive,"I had visited Busy Boots due to the high reviews and they held up to the expectation. I came in for a headlight replacement and the service was quick for same day. When picking up my car Jose had suggested a few things needing additional repair, I was a bit weary because I have very little knowledge of cars. He did suggest a few things that should be on top of my list. I considered the additional work and came back the following day for a transmission flush and front motor mount replacement. My car hasn't driven this good in YEARS. I am beyond grateful for the suggestive repairs that I actually NEEDED. Thank you again Busy Boots I can get a few more years out of my old faithful Focus."
positive,"Wow! Great service, great communications and great pricing. Chad was awesome! Really knew his stuff. He kept me updated on his arrival by text. Was on time and had a smile when he met me. He had my car repaired in no time. What a time and back saver for me. His bussiness card is permanently in my wallet. A very rare thing for me to do. Well done Chad and Anyplace auto. You guys are awesome and I can see why you are rated #1 on yelp."
positive,I can't say enough about Israel's Trans. Fixed my transmission for a great price and got me back on the road. A few months later an axel went out and when the dealership tried to get me to overpay they stepped up and even helped out me out with that for less than half the price! Great and honest work! Thank you so much!
positive,Took my car in today after making an early morning call. They were very friendly on the phone and told me to bring it right down.  I dropped it off and they did a free check told me my transmission was fine and serviced it all in an hour. Price was within what I would say is normal range . I would highly recommend them
positive,Update: Over 100k miles on this transmission behind a high horsepower small block and still shifts like new.
positive,"We took our car here and I now will never take it anywhere else.
The service was great. He explained  everything to us, and had the car fixed and back to us within hours.
Our car wouldn't automatically shift gears. We thought we needed a whole new transmission.... but we didn't. 
I am impressed with the honesty and quality work.
It's like driving a brand new car again."
positive,"Son broke down in Blythe and Kens in Phoenix had the transmission we needed. Picked it up, drove it to Blythe and had it installed there so he could continue his trip. Shortly after being installed it started having problems again so limped back to Phoenix to have Kens look at it. There was some concern the issues were caused by the shop in Blythe who installed the new transmission but Kens said don't worry about anything and simply took care of the repair free of charge. This is an honest shop that does the right thing for the customer even if it wasn't their mistake. Very happy with how they handled this and will use them again. Highly Recommend."
positive,Update: it's been 2 1/2 years of pounding on this transmission with a high horsepower small block all over the western US and it is still perfect.
positive,"Recently I bought a car and needed a high quality alignment since the tires on this car are so expensive. I found a local car enthusiast forum and they highly recommended Joe and Classic Gold Auto Centre. Joe was awesome. He was totally open to me providing what specs I wanted for the alignment. These kinds of specs aren't very useful unless set exactly vs. most cars' specs have a very wide range that's acceptable (machine shows a green light). Settings specs to an exact number is much more difficult and takes patience on the part of the technician. Joe did the work himself and showed me the final specs and they were EXACT. Even more impressive, when he called to say the car was ready I realized I had forgotten to ask him to check my car to see if it had a power steering leak. He said the car was already off the rack and the racks were full but he'd see what he could do. He called later and said he checked it out and there's no leak. He didn't charge me any additional money. I've taken another car back since then and the service was just as amazing. He's friendly yet professional. I have done 99% of my own work on my cars for over 30 years partly because I don't trust many shops ethics nor competence (a shop once put the wrong kind of oil in a transmission they installed for me and it fried in less than two days of driving). But now I have someone I like and trust so when I don't have the time or energy I know where I can take my car now. There isn't a business of any kind that I'd recommend more highly than this one. 
Thanks guys!"
positive,This shop repaired my 2006 F 150 4r75e transmission recently.  I was charged a fair price and they did good work.  The transmission shifts like new.  I definitely recommend them.
positive,"I wanted to take a minute to say thanks to Scott and his team at Sunland Auto Service for their recent work on my daughters 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee. 

I was worried that the transmission was failing and they could have charged me thousands to replace it but instead diagnosed a much simpler problem and fixed it for 350 bucks. I have 5 cars in my driveway and Sunland Auto will be make much more from me in the future than he could have with that one transaction. 

Thanks
A grateful and loyal future customer.

positive,"The whole crew at Dutch's was amazing!  I didn't even know it was possible, but the motor (or transmission?) went out in my windshield wiper motor...ugh.  I went to two different mechanics that each told me the part alone would be $700!!! That's not what anyone wants right before Christmas.  I called Dutch's to see if they could help and Nan came to my rescue.  She talked to me on the phone, emailed back and forth with me about options and quickly found a way to help.  She found the part my car needed and literally fixed the damn thing in like an hour.  I honestly can't say enough nice things and genuinely felt so grateful for all of the help, concern, flexibility and cost savings.  I thought it would cost me over a $1000 to get the thing fixed with parts and labor, but Nan got everything taken care of for less than $200.  Thank you, Nan!! And thanks to everyone at Dutch's that had a hand in getting me safely back on the road.  Y'all rock!!!!!"
positive,"Great service very happy with the repairs they performed on my vehicle 
Definitely a professional business 
Also gave me and advise towards preserving life of transmission definitely recommend to anyone in need of transmission repairs"
positive,"I am really glad Aliria reviewed this place!  I was literally driving on my way to Danny's car wash for an oil change when I quickly Yelped Lightning Lube and saw her sole review standing proud with four stars.

I will admit that when my phone notified my friends I checked in here, I got a few....questioning...text messages due to the name, but I would gladly head back here any time for an oil change.  I love no-nonsense care places, and the young lady who helped me at the front didn't try and sell me anything extra.  She just let me know that my windshield wipers were all but useless (a fact I've noticed every time we receive a rare rain shower.)  I was so shocked that I wasn't pressured into a $100 transmission flush that I nearly fell over.

The service was really fast and the total came to a very reasonable $30 total - not bad for supporting the little guys against the shady Midas' and Jiffy Lubes'."
positive,"Wiegand provided excellent service. My husband and i had some issues with our transmission on a road trip, and Mr. Wiegand patiently explained how he was checking the transmission as he drove the car. The car handled fine but he also checked the transmission fluid and that told him there was a problem. I really appreciated his thorough approach and experience."
positive,"Don't let the name fool you. These guys just don't do transmissions, they do it all! (except sell you tires). Quality and honest work. The owner (Henry) takes pride in ensuring that integrity and professionalism come first. Sabrina is the office manager and she knows how to get things done! With this dynamic duo taking care of business, you'll be sure to leave happy! I've lived in Vegas for more than 20 years and lucky for me I just recently found Goodcare Transmission, just in time too, because both my vehicles needed major work. Thanks for getting back on the road. My vehicles are operating like new."
positive,"The transmission on my Acura TL blew up driving into town from LA.  The first shop quoted me $6,000+, which seemed outrageous.  I talked to Billy and his dad.  They didn't pretend it could be a minor fix, which others had, and their quote was less than half of the first.  They kept me informed each step of the way and, at my request, test drove it for about 50 miles before I flew back to pick it up.  These people take pride in their work.  Now, 6 weeks later, I'm still a happy guy.  I highly recommend them."
positive,"We just recently moved from WA and I struggle to find shops I trust. I was very candid that I didn't want to take my car to the dealer because they will just nickel and dime you.

My 2014 Chrysler minivan had a bad noise coming from under the hood. Leo understood I was a new customer looking for a trustworthy shop and assured me they would do their best at a reasonable price. Not only did they find a very cracked flex plate, but they got a bunch of other stuff done around my transmission to avoid future labor costs.

I am very happy and fortunate they found the problem and fixed it in a short amount of time. We will be bringing both of our vehicles and future vehicles in for service. Thanks to Leo and the team here our minivan is in great condition and runs better then ever!!"
positive,"I needed to replace my 2008 Prius with a lighter car with manual transmission in order to tow it four wheel down behind my class C RV. After some research on the Internet, I selected the 2018 Honda Fit EX with a 6 speed manual transmission. I contacted several dealerships to verify the inventory on the Fit with manual transmission; and I found a very few, the majority are equipped with a CVT transmission which would require a tow dolly for towing. My concern was still about buying a new car with a trade-in and going through the sometimes painful experience of dealing with some of the car salesman. I decided to elect a dealership only a few miles away from my house and this is how I ended up at Tempe Honda and met with Missy Frietz (internet sales manager). From the first test drive of the car to the final decision on buying the new car, it was the best experience in buying a new car that you could ask for; no pressure sale, just a straightforward deal for the trade-in  and the purchase of the new car with custom accessories installed. I would definitely recommend this dealership to my friends and family. Still can't believe how easy the all process went from driving my old car in and several hours later driving out of the dealership with my brand new 2018 Honda Fit EX. I only had to re-train myself on driving a stick shift vehicle....  Thank you Tempe Honda for the positive experience."
positive,Scott and his team are great mechanics and very honest. They went extra mile to help with a check engine light issue.
positive,"I hate getting my car repaired (just like everyone else) but I like taking it to Chuck's. There is a knowledgeable staff that doesn't take advantage of me (no high pressure sales) and a friendly owner who is always there. I get my work done quickly, correctly and at a fair price."
positive,"Excellent dealership. Came in late on a Saturday afternoon with a problem and expecting to be told to come back on Monday, I was welcomed and had my car repaired within an hour. I know that if the problem was greater it would have taken longer. However the fact that I came in late and was treated well was a pleasant surprise. The service advisor Deborah was extremely helpful and very welcoming. I will be a customer forever as long as they continue as they are operating. Congratulations to this excellent dealership."
positive,"Very happy and thoroughly satisfied!!  Chad showed up on time, messaged me ahead to give an ETA, and handled the work with professionalism, and a friendly attitude.   My request was pretty simple; oil and air filter and fix a broken windshield wiper spray nozzle, but I have every confidence in Chad and probably the rest of the crew's ability to handle most any need.  I will definitely use them for any future work and would recommend them to any friends and family.  Thank you for the quality work, and fair price.  And for the referral to have my transmission checked. It's those extras that turn a great customer experience into an exceptional one."
positive,"He has a shop now at Rancho/Cheyenne, just behind the Savers. I was blown away by the personal service. I had a simple check engine light issue. He first spent several minutes on the phone with me discussing the issue, then I set up an appt. and after we got off the phone the owner, Scott, text me the address of his shop- like what place does that?! Turns out he regularly emails/texts customers to show them their damaged parts, communicate, etc. Anyway, I went down there and he not only diagnosed my problem but fixed it at no charge (turned out to be a simple fix). He and his crew then spent about 30 min with me going over some general things about my truck, what they do there and what they can do for my vehicle. I've never received such personal service from a mechanic so he's won my business for good now. I highly recommend 1st Response Mobile Repair!"

positive,I found this place through all the good reviews it recieved and it lived up to the hype. Ray was incredibly kind and eased my nerves in getting my car repaired. This will be my new go to spot for my auto needs.
positive,"If you need a quick or even an extensive muffler repair look no further than Affordable Muffler. Walked in one evening around 4:30pm, they took my car right back, a tech looked at my car, called me back to explain what the issue was and why he thought it happened and quoted a price. There was no pressure to move forward unless I felt completely comfortable with what they were doing and the cost of the service. I was in and out in 30 minutes at a price that no other commercial car place could even come close to. Professional, honest, and best of all priced properly! Do not go anywhere else for muffler repairs. Good work fellas!"
positive,"My wife was in her hometown of Gastonia, NC to see her family and was headed home when our 2004 BMW 330Ci (SSG) beeped at her and entered ""limp"" mode on the transmission (we live in North Georgia now).

Knowing that it would require specific-knowledge to diagnose and correct I called my local mechanic and asked the guys on e46 Fanatics for a recommendation.  Lake Wylie Euro was the answer.

She took the car down at closing and left it over night.  Nick called that evening saying he couldn't duplicate it but had ordered a Salmon Relay just in case so it would arrive in the morning.  He and I talked about the vehicle and a possible leak in the clutch fluid reservoir - he double-checked that and it was 1/2 liter low.  :-0

Rather than charge me for a whole liter of Pentosin, the relay, and a couple hours of labor, he topped it off and added a few dollars for his time (far less  time than he actually spent on it).  He returned the relay to the distributor...all this to an out-of-town client he'd never met.

If you're in the area and need an honest, knowledgeable mechanic...THIS IS THE PLACE!"
positive,I called Louie about going through my transmission. I dropped it off he went through the transmission within a few days. I figured since he was busy in would take a week or 2. I had it back in 4 days. Louie was great to deal with and will definitely recommend him to everyone.
positive,"My transmission went out on my 2014 GMC Sierra during recent business trip to Las Vegas. My first instinct was to take my truck to AAMCO  Transmission since they have a nationwide warranty...BIG MISTAKE!!! Zero dollar diagnostic drive turned into $850.00 exploratory transmission removal and disassembly which turned into $4,600.00 estimate for complete transmission rebuild. Remind you that my truck is a very well maintained 2014 vehicle. I was told that a factory transmission would cost $4,600.00 just for the transmission. I asked what the warranty would be if I paid the $4,600.00 to have the transmission rebuilt...ANSWER: 12 month/12,000 mile warranty. This was unacceptable. I called Auto Nation GMC and asked what the cost of factory GMC transmission...ANSWER: $2,700.00 with a 3 year/100,000 mile warranty when installed by a certified transmission shop...Wow, big difference from AAMCO Transmission. I then asked AAMCO if I bought the transmission from the GMC DEALER if they would install it so I could get the 3 year/100,000 mile warranty...ANSWER: No, we only rebuild transmissions. What's the warranty again? 12 month/12,000 mile warranty. Completely unacceptable!!!

Part 2)

I called LAS VEGAS TRANSMISSION. They said they would install a GMC Factory transmission...ANSWER: $650.00. Total cost for a Factory GMC transmission with removal and installation $3,350.00 with a 3 year/100,000 mile GMC Factory warranty!!! 

LAS VEGAS TRANSMISSION is a truly unique shop, Louie(the owner) saved me from making a big mistake! I can't thank him enough for his hard work and honesty. Honesty and Integrity are very apparent at LAS VEGAS TRANSMISSION. Thanks to you my truck was repaired in a little over 1 day and I can return to California this Friday. I am a 100% satisfied customer. I wish I could give LAS VEGAS TRANSMISSION 10 stars! They are that good! Thanks again Louie!!!"
positive,"My challenger got a muffler delete from here and they were so quick - only took 15 to 20 minutes and you can watch them working on your vehicle. They were really fast and have great customer service. The price was very good too ($90)

I really wish I did the rear resonator delete from these guys (I did that one year prior at a different company in Henderson and it took half a day to do and was $50 more)"
positive,"So I have just bought a Kia spectra manual 2004 and was concerned about some things not working, some of which I fixed myself to save cash. I'm good at fixing stuff if I have tools but I needed an oil change and an honest opinion about the cars condition as I might be taking it cross state. Initially I took the car to We Fix it across the street as I was lowered into their trap of free car wash and complete engine check with oil change. I was told by Andres after calling them all day inquiring about my cars status and was put on till the end of the day. I had left the car with them only for an oil change and on my way back to collect the car I used the bus which stopped right in front of lighting lube. I decided to inquire about their services. God I'm happy I met Sam I think that's his name. 

We fix it told me I had to spend $480 for things like left Axel replacement, transmission fluid leak, power steering leak, and couple of other things.

I knew the Axel was fine so I said okay I'll come back later and took the car to lightning lube right away. To my surprise Sam asked me to come have a look at my cars bottom side. He told me everything honestly that none of those things are bad and I saw that. I was embarrassed that this gentlemen had given me an honest opinion about my car but I couldn't get an oil change because I just got it done across street. I've been to him second time to get something checked, they fixed it right away and now I'm obliged to write this long review. 

I'm new to USA and hadn't met a single honest person since the past four months I've been here until I went to lightning lube. I would come back to them for sure no matter what."
positive,"We can't say enough good things about Louie, Scott, and Alfredo!!  Our motorhome broke down in Las Vegas.  Auto Club towed it to a place that gave us an astronomical price for a transmission that they would have had to order.  They were not a transmission shop and since we lived 300 miles from Vegas, I asked Louie if he could go to the location, where the motorhome had been towed, and take a look at it.  Louie was there within an hour.  He called me, gave me a price to completely rebuild the transmission, and got the job done.  After the work was completed Louie called me. We drove from Southern California to pick it up.  It is running perfectly---like brand new.  Trust me.  It has been thoroughly tested going from Vegas back to San Diego---up and down mountains and through 110 degree heat shifting very smoothly. Yeah, have any of you seen that thermometer in Baker??  Brutal heat!!  I'm hoping that other people who need transmission repairs will not hesitate to use this business to get the job done----and get it done correctly at a very reasonable price!!!  With the way we were treated, it is the least I can do to write a positive review. Thank you to all who did such a good job and got our RV back on the road!!!"
positive,"Everyone here was super helpful, very nice, the complimentary shuttle was really convenient while I was getting my car repaired, and I got more out of my warrantee than I expected! All around great!
Also the coffee maker is delightful. Much quieter and more low key here than any Toyota or Ford dealership I've been to & quite a pleasant experience.
Omg they even washed my car for free I didn't even recognize it when I went to pick it up! Definitely deserve 5 stars wish I could give 6!"
positive,I was sent here from my local shop to get my muffler fixed and wow! They are first come first serve here and they are so honest. They don't make you spend more money than you have to.. I spent 119 here for a new muffler and my car doesn't sound like a shoe in a dryer anymore! Thank you Pete and the amazing employees that work here. Y'all were great!
positive,"Best auto repair shop in town!  I've been in Vegas for 8 years now and have been to many shops with our old cars.   I'm delighted to recommend anyone to go here because at most auto repairs shops there's a service writer who's job appears to be to maximize how much money they can squeeze out of you, and scare you into more aggressive maintenance work that you don't need.  Not the case here at AAMCO on Valley View!

We first brought an old Camry here for a transmission fluid flush a few years ago, and they talked us out of doing any service.  

Scott and Kyle run the show and they are straight shooters.  Call in and ask them for great guidance on anything Auto Repair.   Most recently brought my truck in for a transmission leak, they quoted me a very fair price - $300 less than the place where I got my oil changed.  When I brought it in, they said Hey it's not actually that, it's a different seal, will save you $100.   Great!

My girlfriend dropped me off for the pick up and asked if she needed some fluid changes for her vehicle - Nah, you're probably good for another 30k miles.  

Anyway, it's all I ever wanted any Auto Repair shop to be - Honest."
positive,"My stepdad, who lives in Amherst, always uses Christian Bros,  so I knew they must be pretty good for him to drive all the way to Avon. My daughter's check engine light came on so we took her car in for the first time and were nothing but impressed! We worked with Isaiah,  who was friendly and professional throughout the whole process. I love the text updates and the detailed report they send via email.  Highly recommend this place!"
positive,"Kind of pricey, yet competitive, but very happy with the transmission, customer service and satisfaction. Ron the owner went above and beyond to include new engine mounts and transmission mount inclusive with original estimate, at no extra cost."
positive,"One weekend my son was driving a long distance back to Georgia. His car started having problems, we thought it was the transmission and to not make it worse he got a hotel in Concord and called 5Star first thing Monday morning. Debbie was very nice and helpful, got us right in for it to be diagnosed. Thankfully it was not the transmission. They told us what it was and he was on his way. Thank you for being honest and very helpful!!"
positive,"This is the only auto shop I'll go for my car service. 
I used to only do smog check here since it's down the street from DMV. But lately I did some other services as well..oil change, transmission oil, brake fluid, belt, and tire rotation. Those guys work really quick just to reduced ur wait time. I saw tons of cars in their shop but I only have to wait an hour and half. Prices is very reasonable and staff is really friendly and plenty of snacks and drinks at the waiting lounge! Definitely recommended!"
positive,"AAMCO took care of my 36 year old transmission in record time.  If no frills, family oriented business and service is what you're after, then this is the place to go. Buying a replacement transmission wasn't an option for me (they don't make them) but Kyle and his staff were more than happy to fix the problem with mine. Their care and attention to detail did not go unnoticed, and I will bring all future driveline related business to them. Thanks

Update: my cousin recently moved to town and I helped her buy a small economy car to get back and forth to school. Unfortunately this morning, he alternator went out. Within 4 hours she was back on the road. Scott, Pam, and Kyle, you have a tremendous family operation. I am forever grateful of your services, and will continue to be a devoted customer. Many thanks."
positive,"This is the ONLY place to go if you want a mechanic who will be completely honest and fair with you. My husband's family has been coming here for the past 20 years and would only trust them with their vehicles. My truck had grinding brakes, a busted radiator, and a transmission that had black tar-like fluid.  Corby let me know up front what the issues were and was more than willing to give me a very reasonable price to fix it up. My truck is perfect now and drives like a new one."
positive,"We just left here. We had taken one if our cars to another shop in Ft Mill and told our transmission needed to be replaced after spending 1500.00. We decided to check out Neighborhood garage based on other reviews. Let me tell you- I will NEVER go anywhere else ever. From the minute we got there Andrew was awesome. So friendly and helpful.  He have us a fantastic quote and then also checked out my car as well. 

Not only were the prices perfect but they make you feel good. Aside from that- watching the other customers come in and out and they knew them all. They recently moved and it seemed as though everyone followed them. They were proud of their new spot and they showed it off to their customers. 

It's hard to find a small town feel in a garage but this place is it. I love it! We were there for about an hour and it seemed like 10 minutes. Love this place!"
positive,"My husband and I just moved down to AZ from IL and during the drive down we had transmission problems. Being from IL we always have ""a guy"" for everything, so I was unsure what to do now in AZ. I looked at the reviews for On The Go Transmissions and figured I would give them a shot. Let me tell you I was not disappointed! 

Donald is amazing! Not only is he knowledgeable in cars, he is also fair, considerate, and ethical, a rarity in the auto industry.  As many people are not familiar with all the workings of a car, they are really at the mercy of the mechanics. Rest assured with Donald he will give you a fair and honest assessment. He even told us after he fixed the initial problem and as even more work seemed to be needed, that he did not want to take any more of our money, and suggested that we evaluate the amount of money spent on the car. Who does that? An ethical man that's who, someone who cares about their customer and not just their bottom line. 

I can now officially say, ""I have a transmission guy in AZ."""
positive,"Not one to give five stars, so this is an example of what it takes to get that rating.  Service was absolutely outstanding.

I backed into a neighbors car.  And it happened to be the day they were moving into their new home.  Welcome to the neighborhood!  No injuries, but their driver door was well-smushed and my rear end was dented and a side panel had popped out.  Oh joy!

My USAA auto insurance (another player in this drama) told me to go to Caliber and rent a car from Enterprise (the third player).  So when USAA recommends and uses a vendor you can count on quality and consistency.  So off my wife and I went.

Located on a small road running behind  KFC is a beautiful building with colorful sign.  THIS was Caliber.  

I dreaded going in as auto repair, and especially auto body repair, operations are generally gritty, dirty staffed with gritty, stained and dirty employees.

Pleasantly, this was not the case with Caliber.

When we check in, wife and I were astounded at how clean and neat everything was.  The body shop floor was immaculate and polished.  The office neat and comfortable.  And the restrooms very clean.

Further, the receptionist informed us that Enterprise was coming with our rental car!  Amazing.  

After completing paperwork with Caliber, we went over to Enterprise to do their paperwork and then home.  Total time to get this done:  less than an hour.

We were told it would be a few days to get the car repaired, but the phone rang at 2pm telling us that the job was done.  Great, but I had to return the rental car.

Caliber informed us that they would return our car to us and then pick up and return our rental car.  

The day was ending.  Around 5:30pm Caliber called to tell us that they (two people) were on the way.  By 6pm we had completed their paperwork, paid for the repairs and handed them our rental car.  They took the rental car to their home and returned it to Enterprise the next morning.

We were amazed at how smooth, efficient, courteous and downright nice they were.  This is the definition of outstanding customer service and concern.  Although we do now want to have another collision occasion, we know now that Caliber will get our business.  

A great organization with wonderful people.  Many thanks, Caliber."
positive,"Was referred here by a mechanic friend, and this place is the bomb!  Scott the owner was at the front desk and a great guy to talk to.  I went in to inquire about preventative Transmission fluid change and he told me honestly you don't need it.  Wait til you do, then come back.  Sent me on my merry way for a cost of a firm handshake.  

They're a full service shop, so they do all the other regular mechanic stuff in addition to transmissions, and their staff looks pretty sharp."
positive,"I usually only write bad reviews BUT, I decided to change that. I came across Jack & Sons over fifteen years ago & they are definitely ""my"" mechanics... everything from oil changes to squeaky brakes-they've solved ALL of my problems! I don't ever feel that they've taken advantage of me or used my lack of knowledge regarding auto repair! They always explain the problem & FIX IT at a fair & honest price! I used to dread getting my car repaired-my previous repair shop always made me feel stupid & it seemed like I was constantly at the shop! Now, when a problem arises, Jack & Sons fix it!! Thanks so much guys! I really appreciate all of your help!"
positive,"I can't tell you how happy I am about taking our car here ! My husband has a 1995 Ford Mustang and we just had the transmission rebuilt in July so the clutch needed to be adjusted but he was not  able to do the work himself so he took it to Husband's Automotive and they found the  clutch cable twisted  and not adjusted correctly.They recommend replacing the Clutch Cable ,So happy they will do the work for us ! They work on Foreign,Domestic,Truck and Auto Repair and they have been serving Scottsdale since 1978 . The owner/Operator Dale Husband believes in putting Honesty & Integrity into his Auto Repair Business and I really trust his work ! Definitely a five star"
positive,"It took me four mechanics to find Kuba and his crew. Only person to actually explain the issue with my transmission and told me what options and questions I should ask of the people who were supposed to fix it so that they were actually solving the problem, and honest enough to tell me it was something I should see a transmission shop for. 

Been going here for about a year or so now and the work is always done quickly, Kuba always gives options and honest opinions, and won't try to sell me on additional services. He also explains things in terms I understand without sounding condescending. Kuba once spent about half an hour just checking out concerns I had about my car before fixing an issue I had with my battery and only charged me the $10 for the part. My timing belt broke recently and I had to tow it in, and I ended up paying $100 less than expected based on google estimates. I even get my oil changed here for only $25 (price will vary by car of course).

Make an appointment because they get very busy, but it's completely worth it!"
positive,"How hard is it to find a mechanic that isn't trying to steal from you.. especially in Vegas! This city is all about taking your money! 

My car has been constantly having tire problems, they've popped multiple times and always gets deflated super quick. No idea why but I've spend thousands $$ on tire replacements for the same tire. I've been to Superior Good Year, USA Auto, any chains with decent reviews but it's never been something they fixed. My tire has been replace several times though! 

I came here to Busy Boots once for an oil change months ago, they recommended a transmission fluid change so I came back yesterday. I told the mechanic my car is acting funny. He told me what I needed done (sorry I don't remember) inside my car that fixes my tire problem completely! He put aside the transmission fluid and said it isn't necessary right now, but fixing this tire thing was. He didn't even try to sell me on both! He gave me the check-in discount and fixed it within 4 hours like he said. He could've told me to flush my transmission as well but he didn't! That proves to me that here they are not greedy and that is the rarest thing for auto shops. 

I'm so glad this place is here, I always hate bringing my car to shops because of the untrustworthy people. But I'm not scared to bring my car here!! :)"
positive,"They didn't fix a darn thing on my car, and yet I am giving Leroy's Auto and Truck Care a five star review. Allow me to explain.

We came in on vacation from California; about twenty miles out from our hotel, we got the check engine light and an alert regarding the vehicle stability control (VSC) system. We called Leroy's, spoke to Troy, and decided to bring in the van to get it checked out early the next morning. Strangely, before we took it in, the warnings disappeared, but we figured we should at least get the sensor data read.

The sensor logs showed some issues with the cam, so we decided to leave it in the shop while they diagnosed and then fixed whatever came up. They drove me back to our hotel, and we spent the day at the pool waiting for an update. Troy called back, told us that the error could not be duplicated despite some thorough test driving (low and high speeds), and decided not to charge us even for the diagnostic. They simply drove our van back to my hotel, dropped it off, and shook my hand.

We're from out of town, in a bit of a sticky situation, and they didn't take the least bit advantage of us. No charge. If that doesn't say five stars worth of trustworthiness, then what does? Thank you, Troy."
positive,"I had a transmission installed 1 year 10 months ago and 12,000 miles later all is working great!!!!  I promised Scott the owner I would post a review if the product exceed its 12 month warranty.   This is a family run business that is honest, polite and a whole lot less than dealerships.  A Honda dealer quoted me ~$6,500, my cost was $1,989.  Very pleased."
positive,"The guys at LG have taken really great care of my car. I originally picked their shop because it was close. I am so glad I did! The first time was after an accident. They helped me to get a rental, worked with the insurance company, and got the work done quickly. 

The workmanship was great. The service was incredible. So when my check engine light came on, I called them to see if they could help. They've worked with me to get my car back on the road for a price I can afford. I will continue to send folks their way and will trust them with this car and any car I get in the future."
positive,"My family and were on vacation when the dreaded check engine light turned on. Before that, we heard a clicking noise that didn't sound right. We panicked and called several nearby shops. We decided to take our car to Pep Boys due to the professional manner they provided over the phone. Len and the other guys there were not only helpful but they took their time out to educate us on how to prevent problems moving forward. The service wasn't too expensive and they were fast. I'd recommend anyone to go here. Thank you!"
positive,"Took my POS White '03 Silverado in for a hose that always corrodes. This time i had these guys do the work. They did everything I did except it was time to replace the hoses, the original hoses. Lasted almost 14 years. They also pointed out my crap replacement fuel pump was loud. Always get the best part possible and have these guys do it. I had been putting that off too. Very reasonable prices, no gouging, Finally some honest guys you can trust. They also fixed my transmission at about 175,000ish, drove that truck like it was stolen and still tacked on a total of almost 240,000 miles. Sorry Steve, traded it in, don't worry it only has a 30,000 mile extended warranty. See you soon. Thanks again for all the years of service!"
positive,"These guys are awesome!  I've gone to this place for multiple automotive problems. I've had my transmission system flushed and refilled, serpentine belt replaced, wiring harnesses repaired, quite a few oil changes, and a tune up.

I have checked prices for each of these services and every time I end up saving money by going to Pat's. In fact, my tune up was roughly $47 cheaper than the next place up the price list (a place off of Glendale & a hundred and somethingth avenue [boondocks]).

They're quick and thorough, and when I brought my car in for the transmission flush they told me they would check to make sure it needed it before they performed the flush. I already knew it needed it as Big O Tires told me so about a week prior, but I appreciated their interest to ensure that it indeed needed to be flushed. I've had mechanics in the past tell me things just to get me back in the shop, but Pat's has been an honest establishment in my opinion.

I moved not long ago a bit out of quick distance from their location, but I will have the car towed there if I have to. I will go out of my way to have Pat's Precision's team work on my car."
positive,"I'm glad I took my car here. I felt they were honest and very detailed about advising you what repairs your car will need. Great Customer service. I think I found my one stop shop for my Lil carcancha( car). All I came in for was an oil change and they did more than that for a great affordable price , rotate tires topped off fluids. I'm a very happy customer. Thanks Guys"
positive,We've taken both of our cars here for service. One they did a diagnostic and found it needed to go somewhere for the transmission. They didn't charge us and referred us to a place in Phoenix that did a good job and was very affordable. Our other car they did an extensive diagnostic on and gave it a tune up and some other things. The car had been out of commission for two years and they got it working really well and for a reasonable price. We'll definitely be going to them in the future. They were really nice and seem really honest.
positive,"I took my car into AW collision after my accident. Tom and the entire staff were very help and supportive throughout the entire process. The insurance company ended up totaling my vehicle, but I cannot say enough about the time and effort that AW put in. They made sure that I was well informed at every point during the process. My parents had their car repaired at AW so I know the quality of work is second to none. If you are having a hard time with the insurance company and need honest opinions and amazing service AW should be the first place on your list. I hope I never get into another car accident, but if I do there is absolutely no question as to where I will bring my vehicle."
positive,"I called and made an appointment with Ed. He was this really sweet old guy working in the service section.

I took my 2006 Kia in because my check engine light was on. After waiting an hour or so, they said it was just the sensor that needed to be replaced and that it was covered under my warranty. On another note, my rear brakes were basically to the rotors. I needed to replace those (for $250, yikes!). I also had to bring my car back in another day as they had to order the sensors to replace.

I brought it back the next week and dropped it off. Within 30 minutes, the shuttle driver took me to work and I arrived on time (8am). Later, when my car was done, I was called a notified. I didn't have a ride back at the moment as the shuttle driver got off at 4pm and I didn't finish work until 5pm. Ed told me he would be able to leave my keys at the cashier as they stay open until about 9:30pm.

I made it to the dealership before 6pm and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had given me a new car key free of charge. Previously I had lost my whole set of keys (car, apartment, mail, etc.) so I had been using a spare key and just hadn't had time to get a second replacement.  

I can't give them a full 5 starts because of costs. Although I paid for my rear brakes to be changed, I am also due for a timing belt replacement and that will be $720 which I can't really afford. :( Otherwise, I would go back again!"
positive,"I took my 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee here for a special problem with the transmission. Part of it was covered under a recall. They were able to fix the problem quickly at a reasonable cost, and everything has been working like a charm since then. Great service and an honest staff. Kudos!"
positive,"We have a 27 panel solar array on our roof and with it came the pigeons. The constant pigeon droppings were a problem. 

We called three contractors to price putting a barrier around the panels to keep the birds out. One said the front edge couldn't be done but their ""I don't want the job price"" was over $2,000. The second didn't show up. The third was The Pigeon Man. He said it wouldn't be a problem and would guarantee his work and product. 

He showed up at our home today to begin work. After a long day on the roof he finished about 8pm. His work is very clean, precise and from what I can see from the ground is non penetrable by the birds. He is very knowledgeable about the pigeons, their habits, the diseases they can carry and the potential for transmission to humans. We highly recommend Scott, The Pigeon Man.

Thank you for your hard work Scott!!"
positive,"My experience with TransArt has been All positive
They rebuilt the transmission on my 2001 Honda Odyssey Van 
The Van was in perfect condition other than a Honda failed transmission (typical for this model)
Work was reasonably priced and done right with a guarantee 
I drove it for 2 more years and got top $ trade in value because the notorious Odyssey tranny problem was fixed 
Second time at Arts my daughters car was acting like  drive train problems (loud noise)
To keep it short it turned out to be rocks trapped between the motor mounts and  frame
Some businesses could have and would have charged me for unnecessary work but not Trans Art
This business has integrity"
positive,Steve and his crew handled my transmission trouble with care and professionalism. Gave me a good price as well. I highly recommend them. When the work was complete they went over all aspects of my service and didn't try to up sell me at all.
positive,"I have been a customer of Tinoco's since he first opened up on East Charleston, connected to a muffler shop (Lenadams Dorris recommended Tinoco's in Citylife in the late 90's, and it was an excellent recommendation).  Since then, I have eaten at his locations (all now closed) on Warm Springs and The Arts Factory.

A few incontrovertable truths about dining at Tinoco's to date.  You will always get well prepared food.  The service will always be friendly (I think many staff are family and friends).  He will always have his signature dishes available, prepared well (Sea Bass with potatoes and spinach, Pasta with blackened shrimp, red pepper sauce and peas, and excellent house salad with bleu cheese and candied pecans, pesto rolls, etc...)  His restaurants continue to be a good value based on the quality of food served.

The Las Vegas Club locations is very good, menu has been expanded a bit (although I am still not a fan of the 'pallete' tables brought over from the Arts Factory - odd shape, wobbly, depressions for condiments are distracting - but a minor detail).  My favorite location remains the now gone original on East Charleston - the notion of this undiscovered gem and such good, simple, well prepared food and good service being offered in this modest location made it special, as it exceeded all expectations.

Tinoco and his team, in my assessment, are valued local restauranteurs who have tried many locations in serving the Southern Nevada community.  I applaud his efforts, quality consistency and value."
positive,"Went in this past Friday 10/20/17 to get some exhaust work done on my 2015 Mustang GT. I called literally 7 minutes before they closed thinking I had an extra hour but even with them about to close they still took me in. Worked on my car after business hours to my luck and not only was it fast, but it was really good work! Resonater delete with an X pipe, muffler delete and my car sounds as loud and aggressive as ever. Thank you guys and I'll be sure to have all your deliveries on time.... sincerely, FedEx guy."
positive,"Good experience here! They shoot u straight and have fair prices... you definitely gotta try out everything in the cars tho... the quality ranges from decent to pretty good.  But there were a couple with check engine lights on... which I was surprised at.... anyways, hopefully my buddy will be driving away with a  Toyota Matrix today. :)"
positive,"Best quality parts in town.  John, Glen and Byard are equally genius.  I had major scare with a transmission in one of my late model trucks and they found me a rebuilt one after much searching, but then using good-ol-boy wisdom they directed me to try a 13dollar bottle of seafoam for transmissions.  A hundred miles of driving later it freed the sticking valve and I saved nearly 3000.

They will teach you and talk to you.  Also very friendly guys."
positive,"I had the best experience with AutoNation Nissan Chandler that I've had at a dealership in a long, long time. Sarah B. was fantastic. She was efficient, very, very knowledgeable on the product and about cars in general.  Most sales people don't know jack about cars, they leave it up to the service guys.  Sarah B. definitely new her stuff.  I've built engines, transmissions, paint car, etc. and most sales people (especially guys) try to act like they know what is going on with a car and if you didn't know any better it sounds like they know what they're talking about, but most don't.  Well Sarah B. knew her stuff.  Very impressed. That was just a bonus. Sarah B. got us in and out with a great price, no hassle, very fast and all questions answered. She followed up after the sale to make sure everything was ok.  I'll buy my next car from Sarah B. Thanks!"
positive,"Service review: Friendly, on-time, very straightforward, very informative. They counseled me on which repairs to get now and which to wait on. I had recalls on brakes and electrical, plus transmission fluid, alignment, air filter, wiper replacement. In at 9:30 by appointment, done around 4:00. Virgil was my advisor."
positive,"These guys are awesome! Had some issues with my girls car and brought it in for them to determine what needed to be done.  Had some work done and check engine light came on again a few days after.  When I brought it back, they solved the issue and didn't charge me a dime for the labor which ran 3 hours and would've been almost a couple hundred bucks elsewhere.  After being ripped off by countless mechanics all over the place, Randy and Cory are real professionals in the way they treat their customers.  Highly recommended!"
positive,So Wednesday was 1st time ive been back since trading in the old car i had always brought to this business. My check engine light had come on and I thought no big deal cause its bout that time for an oil change. We were immediately greeted by stephen the manager. We explained why we stopped in and he went to take a look at my fiat. He wasnt sure why the check engine light was on since it didn't have anything to do with an oil change. We told him we still wanted the oil change and we would leave my car there and run some errands. Stephen said he would call us when ready. When we returned he asked how long i had the car. Long story short- he was completely honest in what he thought the problem was and advised us to contact the dealership to addressing the issue. He could have done what so many businesses do and said we can fix the problem right now for whatever dollar amount-but he didn't. The integrity and honesty of this business and the employees is what has kept us bringing our vehicles here and will continue to do so in the future
positive,"I went to these folks after having 3 other major transmission shops look at my 2005 Nissan Quest. Everyone down to the last shop said the same thing. New, rebuilt or used transmission starting at $2500 up to $4500 for a new transmission. OUCH! When they ran the diagnostic codes, they all concluded it was bad transmission.  The private part we purchased this van from had also recently had the tranny rebuilt, and yet the problem remained. At this point I contact Five Star. The service manager I spoke with (Danielle) was extremely knowledgeable. She stated they could rebuild this tranny and provide the same warranty as the other garages for half the cost.As a former auto mechanic I knew this task would not be easy as some refused to even work on the van. Although it took several tries to get this right, (remember my error codes lit up like a Christmas tree when we drove the car in) after several attempts and patience on both sides, the mechanic was finally able to correct the valve body problems and clear the tranny's error codes. (Intermittent electrical problem) Most dealers and repairs shops would have given up. 5 Star stuck by their word and delivered as promised. I recommend this shop for their tenacity and living up to their promise. I gave them  4 stars instead of 5 only because it took longer then they had stated, and because they are closed on Saturday's slowing down the repair process. Otherwise you cannot find a better shop for the price and integrity by standing by their word."
positive,"Good job guys! 5 star service. In and out under an hour! Reasonable pricing. Change the oil and flushed the transmission on my company's van. Special thanks to Peter & Scott. They was polite, and honest. The shop looked very clean. That tells a lot about a mechanical automotive shop."
positive,"Oh no, the dreaded check engine light came on! Searched for someplace really local as the car was shaking.  While looking at their website thinking ""this is going to be expensive"" I found a coupon and decided to go in.  Chris at the front desk was very nice, greeting me and letting me know they could certainly diagnose that day.
They were very thoughtful and involved me in the process asking about the car history, recent events to get to the root cause of the issue.  All said, they determined it was more than likely mis-firing injectors.  Cleaned the injectors right then and there, and no issues since.  I appreciated their communication, consideration, friendliness and no up-sell on things I didn't need.  Thank you Doctor Auto!"
positive,"I have had the most excellent service from Power Nissan!  My transmission went out on a vehicle I had purchased from a different dealership. With my transmission still being under warranty, I assumed my dealership would help. They never returned my calls. 
I called up Power Nissan and spoke with a gentleman by the name of Dustin. He immediately knew the issue and was quick to inform me that parts and labor will be completely covered. I had my car towed over there while I was at work. Dustin called to confirm my car had been dropped off and said that I would need to stop by and sign some forms. 
I had ridden my bike (this location is only 3 miles from my house). Being Arizona, a 3 mile bike ride at 4 pm in July was a bear. When I has arrived, I was directed to Dustin's desk and was immediately helped. Not only was he great to work with, he informed me of a previous recall on a different part and had that replaced as well. They provided me with a 2012 Rouge, which was big enough to fit my bike in. They loaded my bike and I was on my way. Excellent experience. Thanks Dustin!"
positive,"very good experience very friendly shop.  they fixed a transmission problem that no other shop could. they charge flat rate, so if the charge is one hour and it takes more time you only pay the one hour."
positive,"Tofu Hut, move aside!

We LOVE this place. The prices are right, the amount of food and the quality of it is amazing. 

Food: AWESOME. About $20 a pop for all you can eat. Everything we tried was very good, especially the wine marinated pork belly. They give you a lot of sides as well, and their spicy salad is very comparable to other KBBQ's in the area.

Service: Now this stands out. You will always have someone coming by every few minutes to check on you and make sure you are having a good time. You don't get this at most places, all you get is just a blank nod and the check when you aren't even halfway done. 

Parking kind of sucks, especially on peak times, but that's to be expected. Be prepared for dropped suspension neon 1995 Honda's with mufflers the size of a bowling balls roaring here and there though. ;)"
positive,Armando is amazing. Explain to me everything that was going on with my Ford Explorer.  My transmission has been a issue for me for over a year.  Taking it to him. They were able to find the issue and fix it. My car is running great and Love the shop the guys know what they are doing. I will never take my car anywhere else. Thank you so much for fixing my nightmare and making it prefect again.
positive,"We're new to the area, just moved here from Oregon. These guys are upfront, honest, and truly go the extra mile with their customer service. My boyfriend and I both came in for transmission flushes and while we were here, my boyfriend asked if they'd happened to see if the air flow sensor was dirty. the guys ended up finding a couple issues with a detached hose and an air leak. These are things I really feel we're ""extra"" time from them, as they weren't really obligated to check them out. On top of that, they discussed SO MANY different things with us that we had questions on. Highly, highly recommended."
positive,"I was on my first Vegas trip with a friend and he asked me what I want to do if I could do anything and my instant thought was to drive a Lamborghini. I've driven several Ferraris, Porsches, and other sports cars but I've never had the opportunity to drive a Lamborghini. They had several to choose from, I selected a beautiful orange Aventador. 

The place was really busy when we were there. After selecting the car and package, I attended a 15 minute safety class with about 15 other people where they tell you if you go on the blue and white track borders, you are removed immediately. If there would have been a shoulder between the edge of the track and borders, I would have felt a lot more comfortable. 

After the class, you go on a ride along with a driver to get a feel for the course. There is a fairly long straightaway where you can get the car up to 110 or 120 and several turns with cones to help your apex. The biggest disappointment for me was no manual transmissions with the car I drove utilizing paddle shifters (it's just not the same). But it was an experience I will never forget and highly recommend if you are a car junkie like I am. 

We took a limo from the Mandalay Bay where we were staying. I can't remember if it was complimentary or extremely discounted but I remember we were surprised when told about it. The driver gave my two companions who weren't driving champagne on the drive up and found my beer of choice in the trunk when we were departing. Our entire trip was perfect and everything I could ever hope for in a first visit."
positive,"Friendly, efficient service. Got my transmission replaced a few months ago and runs perfectly. Great job!"
positive,This shoppe is not far from the house so thought it was ideal for transmission work on my car. I had to pre-order a special part. Customer service wasn't great but was so happy once the car was fixed. Price wasn't too bad. Car is running better than ever. You may have to wait a few as there may be other cars ahead of yours but it's well worth the wait. Cheers***
positive,"My civic showed a solid battery warning light on Sunday night. I'm lucky I picked hondoctors the next morning : they made a reservation by phone (1 hour later), started work as soon as we arrived, took me and my wife to a casino while waiting, and called when the car was ready and picked us up.
Total time: 4 hours!
Price: very reasonable
Quality: excellent.
Oh, by the way, we were just visiting and had no place to stay, and hondoctors fixed a check engine light for free. 
Way above average service."
positive,"Brought my wife's Mini Cooper in for what seemed to be a transmission repair. 
The vehicle was under Carmax's extended service plan so I wasn't worried about it to much. 
A day later I get a call that the car was ready and that the transmission wasn't the issue. 
Turned out to be bad gas, previous owners had not put in premium. 
Scott was freaking amazing! 
He was able to help me out and bring the cost down to what I would have originally paid. 
Wonderful service, will never go anywhere else. 
I even got a sweet loaner. 
Thank you so much Scott!!"
positive,"I had my car repaired at Family Auto Care recently and had a pretty good experience. I read the reviews on Yelp (of course) before taking Theo in. Theo's power steering had randomly and instantly gone out on me one night while driving home. I try to take good care of my car and I instantly felt that drop in my stomach when my wheel took the strength of ten men to turn.

I was able to use some power steering fluid and temporarily repair the leak and limp Theo to Family Auto Care. I had spoken with Cassandra before taking him in and she sounded very friendly and assured me that my car(Theo) would be well taken care of. 

I dropped Theo off on a Friday and was called on Tuesday to let me know he was ready. Cassandra had given me an estimate before the repair that was very accurate and I did not feel overcharged or hassled. The only reason I knocked one star off is because once I got Theo back the AC was suddenly not working. I knew that it was certainly working before I dropped my car off.

I called Family Auto Care to let them know that my AC was not working and Cassandra told me to bring my car in whenever was convenient for me. I brought Theo back on a Thursday afternoon and they took him right back. Turns out an O-ring had been broken while repairing the power steering panel. Family Auto Care repaired it no questions asked and took care of it without a problem. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an honest auto repair location in Chandler. They are also located in downtown Chandler which is home to many of the best local eateries which is great if you are waiting on a repair."
positive,Wow! These guys are unbelievably good! Its amazing the skill they have to match the paint and make my bumper look factory fresh! They gave me a great price and I couldn't be happier! My car looks new again! Don't hesitate to get your car repaired with these guys! It will make you feel better and add more value to your car when you sell it. Two brothers own this company and you can tell they put their all into every aspect of their business. They will take time to talk to you in a non-rushed manner and go over any questions or details you may have. This was my second repair with Ultimate and I'm so happy with their work and professionalism. I'll be using them for all my future repairs now my daughter is driving.. Well done Ultimate Auto!
positive,"I'm a slightly disgruntled Jeep customer after purchasing a 2005 Jeep Wrangler new and winding up in litigation because a dealership replaced a manual transmission gear box at 900 miles after new and did not put any gear oil in the Jeep. When we purchase our 2008 during the darkest hour in the car business we were excited to have lifetime powertrain coverage offered by mfg and have life time service contract offered by mfg.

Fast forward 8 years and dealers everywhere are hung on problematic vehicles with these lifetime warranties.

Diehl of Robinson and Bob Wolford service manager have been instrumental in getting over $7500 of covered repairs done to our 2008 Jeep over the last 2-3 years. 

The people make the dealership. So it's instrumental in making sure that the right people continue to fight the battles for the customers.

Thanks very much

positive,"New Year! New House! New breakfast burritos! To say I was worried about Mexican food in my area after our move is an understatement. I need some sort of burrito factory within a reasonable distance or else why even exist? Our old Ramiro's was pretty good at slinging sour cream and guacamole infused delights so my hunt for its replacement was actually done before the move even commenced. I mean, what great General goes into battle without a well thought out strategy?

Rivas is actually closer than the aforementioned Ramiro's was to our previous residence. Things are starting well. I drove up this morning with one thing in mind; breakfast burritos. Steak, egg, cheese, and potato burritos to be specific. The drive through was pretty standard if not a little cramped but I drive a compact car so this wasn't an obstacle. From order to pick up window was pretty standard, possibly a little faster than average. Price is also average for an establishment like this. So far so good.

The drive home with this type of payload is always horrible. I drive a manual transmission so even trying to single fist a burrito would be a bad idea. These things smelled delish. Upon arriving home, unwrapping, and taking that first bite, my suspicions were confirmed. We have a new burrito place! It was a hot, flavorful party in my mouth and everyone was invited. The steak was a little different flavor than what I was used to due to the spices I assume. But it was a good flavor so I didn't mind a bit. I finished about 3/4 of this sizable meal in a tortilla until I had to tap out. I wanted to go on, but my body said no. Rewrapped and back into the fridge with you, ole' boy! You have just become lunch!

Wrapped food delivery systems are efficient. Arguably a better food system than the almighty sandwich. Remind you I said arguable. Much like sandwiches, though, burritos can be thrown together by just about anyone but that doesn't make it good. Rivas has shown they have what it takes in this field. I see a beautiful relationship developing here."
positive,"First came here a few weeks ago to get work done on my header gaskets. I got the car back, felt better than ever. Solid, strong and mean.
I popped a check engine light, booked my car in and Freddy got my car sorted in a few hours and best of all it was a computer glitch which he didnt charge me for!!!!
I was getting 13mpg before my visit. After the work done and corrections made to my vehicle im now back to 18-19mpg 

This shop is better than friendly ford, if you dont believe me read my review for them.

Thanks for your help sirs!!!!

positive,"First Tip - Go to their website before you go to see if any coupons might be of use!  www.sunautoservice.com/offers

I am a fairly young disabled woman who drives a pretty sporty car and *just the type* mechanics with no scruples try to take advantage of. I'm new to the area and nobody was able to give me a recommendation, so Yelp to the rescue!  Sun Devil Auto at the corner of McClintock and E. Elliot is great!

I really know my car and I went in for a basic oil change, tire rotation, fluid top off before heading out of the area on about a 400 mile trip.  I knew what they should come back suggesting in terms of additional work I might consider doing on the car and I knew just how urgent the work in question *isn't*!  lol  They came back mentioning just the things I already knew about, were honest that my car is perfectly safe and that the repairs in question are just something I'll want to take care of at some point...but there's no urgency about any of them.  Big points right there.  They caught all my cars little problem areas and were straight with me.  That's HUGE from an auto shop.  (At least in my book!)

I had an appointment - something I suggest to one and all whether you're *just* after an oil change or your car is needing to spend more time at the car doctor.  They're kept busy and yet it was clear that they are still being thorough and taking appropriate time tending to each customer's car. They got my car back right on time and it was done in about 45 minutes.  

The ""front desk Daves"" were both really friendly and I ended up having a lovely chat with one of them while I waited on my car.  They honored an online coupon I'd found even though I'd been unable to print it out per the instructions!  I had all my fluids topped off, my oil changed, and they rotated my tires - I was out the door for under $23.00!  That's QUITE the deal.  (Oil changes are typically more like $40 and it's usually another ten bucks or so to rotate tires.)

I had the opportunity to listen to the Dave I hadn't been in conversation with talk with a woman about the problems they'd found with her vehicle and she needed it all broken down and explained in ""bite-sized"" chunks in order to be comfortable and make decisions about what work she wanted them to do. (She'd brought the car in because it was having some troubles and Dave was going over what they'd found and the estimates for the work the shop suggested be done.) I thought his explanations were *fantastic*.  He made the whole thing very accessible for her and she was clearly at ease when deciding what to do.  They get a lot of credit from me for that.  A lot of shops lack the ability to explain complicated car problems to non-car savvy people...and even if they've got the skill, they so often lack the patience!  This leaves customers really wondering if they're doing the right thing agreeing to put all this money into fixing things they don't exactly understand. Good Job, Sun Devil Auto!  I also got to overhear the Dave I did spend time talking with ""breaking the important news"" over the phone to someone that their car repairs had come in a couple hundred dollars UNDER what had been quoted...so they have a sense humor, to boot!

The only thing they didn't do that I'm sort of used to places doing when they do an oil change was vacuum out my car, but at $22 and some change - a timely but thorough job - a totally pleasant experience - and where NO attempt was made to talk me into additional things not necessary - I'm NOT really complaining.  I can vac my own car!  lol

There folks do about every kind of work on cars/trucks/vans imaginable.  The only things they don't really do is much in the way of body work or upholstery.

I only went in for something very basic, but after having the experience I had and getting to see their employees interact with customers whose cars had bigger problems, I wouldn't hesitate bringing my car here again...be it for the maintenance they suggested that does need to be done at some point or for something far more major.

Three Cheers for Sun Devil Auto!!!
P.S.  I think if you mention my name they'll give you a bit of a discount.  Tell them you read Dahlia's review!  Can't hurt!"
positive,"I highly recommend going here for all your auto needs- maintenance, repairs, whatever! The manager Kerry won't bullshit you and try to squeeze your wallet dry... And this is so nice because I'm a woman who knows nothing about cars or cost of repairs! I originally took my car to Carmax because my check engine light had come on. They wanted to charge me almost $200 just for labor and a diagnostic check!!! And I have an extended warranty! So I took it to Kerry, and he did it all for free! Which is what I thought most places do for diagnostic checks. It turned out to basically be a computer glitch within my system- which he fixed still with no charge. I will never go anywhere or see anyone else again as long as he is around! Amazing customer service!"
positive,"Had my car repaired there recently after a pretty bad rear end incident. Not only was I kept up to speed with text messages regularly, but I also received phone calls to update me on my car's status. Drew was specifically the person handling my car and he was professional, courteous and friendly. The girls at the front desk are also very sweet (Anna is who I dealt with). My car was ready the day I was told it would be. When I got in my car, I noticed they had also cleaned the entire interior for me. Great service, am very happy, and would definitely recommend this location of Caliber Collision for your car's service needs!"
positive,I took my R350 in for a check engine light and I must say my visit was GREAT. Alan my service advisor was very professional he got me and my family in and out of the store quickly and once my car had been diagnosed he keep me updated every step of the way. The only surprise we encountered was when my wife and children picked up the car there was a MB Teddy bear for each child strapped in their seats. All in all the service level exceeded what one would expect even for a high end auto dealer and for this I would not hesitate to recommend them to any MB owner.
positive,I would recommend Russell's shop to everyone. Russell is the owner. I took my car to him for a transmission problem. He found out that my transmission was under factory warranty. Saved me 3500.00 dollars. He even called the dealership. And set me up w who to see and everything. Russell you are very honest man. And from here on out you will always get my business. I thank you very much. I will be by and will get you and your crew. Lunch on me. Just let me get my car back from the dealership and I will be there to see you. Thanks again.
positive,"I decided to take my 1991 Ford Explorer to this shop and I couldn't be happier. Paul, the owner, was amazing. A full rebuild with zero problems. Super nice guy and has a ton of knowledge. If you ever need a transmission mechanic, this is the place to go."
positive,Had to have a new transmission in my Jeep and I received prompt and courteous service.There was a delay in picking up the jeep due to a bad part installed from Jeep They graciously paid for a extra day for my car rental and still credited me the $100 coupon. They also extended my warranty till 18 months from 12
positive,"I subscribe to the pass for the car wash and always have a clean car from Cobblestone.  This week I had the oil changed in my Honda Accord by Steve in the service garage and I give high marks across the board.  I was stopping at the dealership for for this service but the cost is now less at Cobblestone and twice as fast.  I'll be having my transmission oil changed and brakes serviced at Cobblestone next, they offer a better value, I recommend them."
positive,"I am so glad that yelp helped me find Ernesto and Alex. Being from out of town and having major car trouble is never good. The stress and fear of my car needing a new transmission and being stranded was put to rest quickly by these wonderful people. A day to get the part in and 6 hours to get my car up and running. Honesty compassion, quick and quality work made my experience wonderful. My drive home stressless and the request from them to call when i got home. Fast,quality,caring,humble and honest service...who could ask for more.
My Angels..."
positive,"Deserves 6 Stars!  I recently had my car repaired at Frank's Auto Body after damaging the front end and hood.  The estimate given by Lisa was very reasonable and everyone I dealt with was so nice.  They kept me informed on the progress every step of the way, which I greatly appreciated.  The best part was when I picked up my car yesterday and it looks BRAND NEW!  I am so pleased with how amazing the car looks...It's as if the accident never happened. I will never get a car repaired anywhere else.  Frank's is the best!"
positive,"Me, my family, and most of my extended family get our cars worked on here. Theyre fast, trustworthy and generally pleasant. Its a little out of the way, but worth it. The last place I went to screwed me over pretty hard so I dont trust for my car earnestly. At least quality transmission  replaced my headlight fluid for free...."
positive,"Went to get my muffler fixed and Mike greeted me so welcoming. I mentioned what my issue was with the car and he proceeded to take a look. Mike explained in detail and made me feel so comforting. The fix was no more than a 25 minutes wait. The price was very reasonable and to make my experience spectacular, I was able to go under the car when it was lifted. I got a tour of the completed work and was able to get a few questions answered besides the muffler. I highly recommend this place. I WILL come back for any other things I'm going to need to my car."
positive,"I went in to scout out used cars before moving to another city, but after talking to Bill Green about some of their options, I was about ready to buy one with WM before moving! He was very attentive and professional, listening to what I needed and taking it into account. The car he found would have been a great fit with my needs. He even volunteered that I could take it to a mechanic, but didn't overly pressure me. Ultimately the mechanic said it would probably need transmission work before too long, so I went with my original plan of buying in my new city, but he left me with a great feeling."
positive,Again excellent customer service! I brought my other car today for a smog check and to check my check engine light. The technician advised me that I should go to Autozone to have the check engine light checked because I would be wasting my money to get a smog check that will not pass. Me recently moving to LV wouldn't have known about Autozone and about the check engine light not letting me pass my smog check. Again 5 stars to this Jiffy Lube for the info!  Thanks!
positive,"These guys were really nice and affordable. Above all they worked with me to get the solution I needed. My muffler broke in two places and I knew that I needed a custom fitted pipe to make it solid again. Went to a couple places and they would only replace from the cat back and quoted at about 275. These guys grabbed some pipe, bent it to fit and kept both the cat and the muffler = $100. That is what is up. Very friendly and kept me in the loop the whole way. Even let me walk under my car and talk shop. Most shops won't allow you to even step foot in the shop. Anyways... This place rocks!"
positive,"We are from out of town and came to this dealership because of an issue with our vehicle and the check engine light came on suddenly. The service advisor was polite and very business-like. He listened to our concerns and wrote up the paperwork and got us on our way. The associates that worked on the service drive weren't very friendly, like the ones at my regular dealership, but they were polite. We were there two days in a row and on both days, they did not have any bottled water in the customer lounge, but their coffee/hot chocolate machine did work. I wouldn't say this was the friendliest dealer I've been to, but it certainly wasn't the worst either."
positive,"I didn't buy my Mazda here, the dealership I bought it at no longer operates. When my check engine light went on, I was not pleased. Past experiences with other dealerships were poor, but I was still under warranty and made an appointment here. I was greeted by Doug Schmitz, who promptly took my info and told me there were 3 recalls in effect, lets get it done. After signing the paperwork, I went to the waiting area, which features comfortable chairs(compared with other service area's), a nice selection of coffee and a refrigerator filled with free bottled water. I checked, and my car was being worked on 10 minutes later. The battery was poor and replaced(didn't know I was under warranty for that), recalls corrected, and they did a full inspection, replacing a sensor that wouldn't have been serviced elsewhere, or found to be faulty, and the car is actually running smoother. My dirty car was also washed. Doug kept me in the loop, and service was done in an acceptable amount of time. IF, you are still under warranty, do your self a favor and get maintenance done here, even if a couple bucks more,  they checked under the hood,under the vehicle, tires and brakes, something you don't get with oil change shops."
positive,"I like giving my old car synthetic oil changes pretty much every 5 or 6000 km, and I switch between a lube joint and a mechanic, just to make sure all the mechanical bases are covered. Usually the lube place looks at everything from tire pressure to reverse lights to transmission fluid while they are draining and replacing the oil. For other mysteries of the vehicle the mechanic will do an inspection of brakes, pumps, tire tread wear, etc, all in addition to the oil change. Usually I get a call from them with a suggestion, like your engine hangers are broken or your brakes are disintegrating on the right side. The car hasn't broken down on me yet (aside from some dead batteries in the winter) so I trust these guys to look out for problems and not sell me things I don't need.

So, when I went to new-mechanic-on-the-block Harper's Tire (""Full Mechanical Repairs"") I was expecting some kind of inspection and maybe to ""Expect the Unexpected,"" but I ended up with a perfunctory oil change in a reasonable amount of time. No 114 point inspection (opportunity to upsell), no query on why the check engine light is on, not even a little sticker in my windshield telling me when to come back. They left up the old one from the last mechanic. 

So, they get points for a decent oil change in a quick time frame with no upsell. When I made the phone appointment I also wasn't offered a 100 point inspection or a winter tune up, so I shouldn't have expected one, but I kind of thought they would at least tell me how my tire tread is and recommend tires (I think the tread is getting low).

Straight-forward, yup. Timely, yessir. Going the extra mile, not really. 3.5 stars rounded up."
positive,"Not just for luxury cars, although that's their specialty, Scott's Coachworks repaired my Mercury Milan after someone backed into it in a parking lot. Ron Carlson is a consummate professional and he took care of all the groundwork, working with the insurance company to get my car repaired in a timely manner. Ron made sure the repairs were done according to spec and they even detailed the car so it looked good as new. Ron kept me updated on the progress of the repairs and he made the process easy and stress-free; all I had to do was drop off the car and he handled the rest, including arranging for Enterprise car rental to pick me up at their shop in Phoenix. It's refreshing to deal with a business that takes pride in their work and delivers supreme customer service. I highly recommend Scott's Coachworks for your automotive collision repair needs, especially for classic and luxury cars."
positive,"absolutely amazing service and excellent mechanics! I came In at 8am when they opened and danny (manager) looked at my muffler for free! did an estimate and then sent it over to the muffler mechanic who price my new resonator at $245 (after labor) the car has been running well ever since. I will definetly return if I need anything more done. its affordable, and they will work out deals! they are usually very quick. it only took 2 hours for them to fix the resonator. I have a 95' vw Cabrio. most vw mechanics are too costly. im a college student so cash I'd tight and so is my schedule. I was out before my exam and my wallet wasn't crying so I recommend this place to every and anyone. They do everything! And they do it flawlessly without killing your bank book or causing you to severely change your daily agenda."
positive,"My check engine light and my stability control light, both, turned on which made me worried and I took my Dodge to the Henderson dealership where Jesse took charge of my repairs and was able to get me into a complimentary rental within minutes of my arrival. He was very friendly, beyond professional and did all he could to get me in and out as fast as possible without withholding any information from me regarding the repair process and details. Something that made a huge impression with me was the fact that he kept a continuous communication with me as to the progress and condition of my vehicle as well as a well defined timeline to the repair completion. Overall, I am absolutely satisfied and having my car fixed seemed effortless, hence i would recommend Chapman Dodge Dealership located at the automall in Henderson over any other dealership in town. Thanks Jesse!"
positive,"Let me just say before taking my car here to the service department I was already -$1,300 and couldn't afford to spend so much again getting it fixed. My Chrysler 200 was still having issues overheating even after taking it to 2 different mechanics. And now even the check engine light would come on and off. I was so frustrated and stressed because my commute just from work back home and vise versa almost always ended on me having to turn on the heater to keep it from over heating(it's summer in Vegas always over 100 degrees, it was HELL) I scheduled an appointment and normally they won't be able to see you until about 2 weeks out. My appointment was on Friday early in the morning I took it in and Devan was the one who took care of me. He did say they were backed up and they most likely wouldn't be able to get to my car until early Monday. I agreed to bring it back Monday morning since I couldn't drop it off for the weekend. I liked that he was up front and told me right there and there instead of waiting until the end of The day on Friday and telling me they couldn't get to it. Anyway he took a look at my car and did a little inspection and tried to explain what the car needs in order to work properly and not overheat( I said tried because car language is not my forte) his small device did tell him a couple of issues that were wrong with the car. I brought it back Monday to drop it off. I have a 9 month old and I had to bring her with me because I didn't have anyone to watch her that day. I live 5 mins away from this place so They did tell me the shuttle( which is just a van) would be able to take me back home. I asked if there would be an issue giving me a ride with my daughter and they said it would be fine as long as I brought the carseat with me which they took out and installed in the van(thank you guys! Would have taken me hours. Lol) Devan called later on that day to let me know they were still running the diagnostics but it looked like there was an internal leak coming from the coolant and that it would be the head gasket as well he said they would need an extra day to get into it and make sure that there wasn't anymore more damage. The next day he called me later in the afternoon and he confirmed there was no more damage other than the head gasket so that would need to get replaced and the thermostats would also need replacement. He did let me know they would need to order the head gasket since it's something they normally don't keep in stock and that the piece arrives the next day in the morning. The following day he called and my car was all ready by 4pm. It stayed for a total of 3 days which I didn't see an inconvenience because I know replacing the head gasket is a long labor, and I would rather them take their time to fix it than to rush and do it improperly. My car has 60k miles on and and when I had called to make the appointment they told me warranty is only covered on cars that have 30k or less so in my head I thought I was for sure going to pay a pretty hefty amount. For the dealership to even look and diagnose your car(depends on what is wrong as well) they charge $139 but Devan did inform me that the head gasket was still covered under warranty and I would only need to pay for the thermostats that they had to replace again. All in total I came out of pocket $97!! I was so relieved! When I picked it up I saw they even did my oil change and they washed the outside. I had never taken my car to the service dept. of the dealership and I didn't know most of them wash your car afterwards, but it still made me happy. Lol. I loved the fact that Devan was in constant communication with me and letting me know what was going on with my car he's awesome!!"
positive,"I heard about 6651 via a few recommendations . Saw their work on a handful of cars and decided to give them a shot . The issue I had was that I installed a new header with too large of flange to connect to my Oem catalytic converter . Ryan informed me that it was a fairly easy job to just add a larger inlet / flange to the catalytic converter . $80 and half an hour later and my car was good to go . Being so picky I asked to see the work before they finished and I was highly impressed . No leaks , clean welds , and they were nice enough to clear the check engine light that had came on from me driving the car over there without the O2 sensor plugged in . I plan on having them powdercoat my rims a different color in the near future . Highly recommend them for anyone looking for anything custom ."
positive,"We were vacationing in Vegas and my Acura started acting up and my check engine light came on. I found these guys open on a Saturday and took my car there. I had to leave my car there so they could fit me into their busy schedule. But they fixed my car, low-cost, and the guys were so nice. They did not treat me like a typical female like most mechanics do. For anyone that lives in the Las Vegas area and who owns a car with a Honda Motor, I highly recommend this repair shop."
positive,"I was really nervous about having my car repaired here due to the previous reviews but after speaking with Steve several times and communicating with him my specific needs and expectations I decided to give him a chance. My car was damaged due to someone rear ending me, but Steve did a great job at repairing my car within a week and a half! He even offered us warranty on the job. My husband and I are extremely thankful to Steve for his great service! We are very pleased with his work."
positive,"I've been three times so far, one scouting trip and a couple of times for PPV Boxing & MMA. It's an excellent layout to watch sports, practically wallpapered in TV screens with excellent lines of sight and comfortable spacing of the tables which allows ease of moving around, flagging a server and a general feeling of decent shoulder room.  The maintenance & cleanliness was excellent each time,  

Menu looks good although so far I've only had the Curry Chicken Taco and shared Calamari. The food was well done and presented. look forward to trying some of the Pulled Pork options in the future.  Servers were pleasant, and attentive without hovering or being pushy. 

Main drawback is the limited parking. They need to enable a few more spots parallel to the wall along the driveway which leads to the back dumpster area and to formalize an agreement for their customers to park in any unused spots of the neighboring muffler shop at night when it;s closed - altbhough people use it anyway it would be nice to have an arrangement for peace of mind that there is no chance of being tagged & towed during the permitted hours."
positive,"Had someone checkout our check engine light reason, someome on top of it as soon as we walked in, got our form with explanation in and out in less than 10 minutes! Very well staffed and very knowledgable."
positive,"I will be a loyal customer to Big Two forever!! We had a pretty big car repair at Big Two which was covered by an extended warranty.  Thank goodness my service coordinator, Grant Foster, not only reminded me that I had a service warranty, but he called the company for me and got the necessary approval all in order; they performed all the required work the next day.  A few days later we headed out of town, on a trip with friends.  We got to Cameron, AZ which is a trading post about an hour north of Flagstaff, where our oil plug fell out, and the car flashed a warning to stop immediately; as we rolled to a stop all the oil flooded out of the car.  The upper oil gasket was the area our major repair had taken place, and I knew I was going to have to become hard nosed about getting my car repaired, a position I hate to be put in.  I called Grant and he immediately started working the issue. We told him we needed to be in UT the next night. While he kept me in the loop, he arranged that he and a service technician would drive to Flagstaff and repair the car that evening at the lot of the local Toyota dealership.  At every turn, he had already thought out multiple solutions, in case the first didn't work he had backup options.  Now admittedly, the cause of the second repair was  the fault of Big Two, but instead of leaving a nasty taste in our mouths by shirking their responsibility, they made the situation as right as humanly possible.  The car was repaired that evening and we were able to continue on our trip without further incident, and with only the slightest of delays. It should also be mentioned that when we returned, Grant called to set up a diagnostic session and detailed our car beautifully free of charge.  And no, I didn't have to demand anything, Grant and Big Two anticipated every turn and we were put in the position of being where we started.  Grant had a positive attitude about everything, and was very attentive.  
If Big Two hires this kind of person to represent them in the service department, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase a car from them and to have my car serviced by them. 
We had an absolutely fantastic experience."
positive,"This shop put the care back into auto repair

Gilbert Family auto is an excellent and professional shop to take any auto to for repairs. I took my vehicle in there, they were honest, and back up their work. I had a minor problem with the car after it was hot and sometimes would not stay started. Thanks to Chuck and the gang and the work they did the problem not longer a problem. Work done- Change out spark plugs, oil filter, and some minor item flush the transmission fluids, cabin filter."
positive,"BY far, Marshall has been one of the nicest, most considerate mechanics I have ever done business with. My volvo 940 had the check engine light on and needed to get smogged, so I desperately needed to find someone who could figure out what was really wrong. Last year I took it to a Midas and after a 200 dollar check engine diagnostic they couldn't tell me what was wrong. My cooling fan had also gone out and several different friends of mine had rigged in a manual switch to keep the car from overheating. When I took the car to Marshall he was able to pinpoint the 2 sources for the check engine light- the voltage drain on the battery from the switch & an overly sensitive knock sensor. He was able to get the light turned out by replacing the bad sensor and rewiring the fan. I was running out of time to pass my smog and get the car registered and he was so considerate of that fact that he was willing to come in on his day off to help me out. We made plans for one day when I had to work, and he arranged to have his girlfriend drive me, but it fell through due to an emergency. Even so, that was a really nice gesture as he was going to have her take me to work and pick me up again at 5. He really took the time to investigate the engine and figure out what was going on to the best of his ability, and after taking several hours to diagnose and test he was willing to negotiate the already beyond-reasonable price with me. When he didn't have the sensor we needed, he was willing to take time out of the next day to quickly install it for me at no additional charge. He was beyond fair, considerate and actually capable of fixing my Volvo- a car that had stumped several mechanics in the past. His shop is small and can get overcrowded really fast, but he's a great guy and I feel no hesitation in taking my car back to him. It's so nice to have found a mechanic I can trust with my car :}"
positive,"Honest, trustworthy, and very good service. Went in to fix a tire and my check engine light came on on the way and didn't know what to expect and they helped take care of it easily. I am very thankful for their service."
positive,"I took my car to Bob because my check engine light was on.  I thought I was having transmission issues.  Bob found out that the spark plugs were the problem.  He saved me thousands of dollars I was willing to spend on a transmission.  Throughout the process Bob was very helpful and professional. 

If any other problems arise, I will be taking my car to Bob first. Best and most honest mechanic I've found in Henderson!"
positive,"We had a check engine light appear on our car seriously right when we were going to get a smog check to register our vehicle (worst luck ever) It was a pretty scary code, (im not a car person) but it was about the torque converter. Looked up some information on that and OMG that can be a pricey problem. Called a few shops and received many different answers/quotes. 

I spotted Bob's Transmissions on Google and noticed how close it was to my home (literally walking distance) and thought, why not? Good reviews on both Yelp and Google so I gave him a call. He told me he could do the repair, to bring the car in and leave it for a bit. We expected to get a call saying ""that will be 3,000"" instead we received a call that said he had it fixed up, gave us a startling low cost and said he got it smogged and it passed. He did say that if the light came back on we would have to do a different repair and gave my husband an approximate price (still about 2-3k less than others I called) and said to come on and pick it up. 

I am so grateful that we decided to bring our car to him. He didn't try to sell us, didn't just jump to the big ticket repair and saved us thousands of dollars. You just DON'T find anyone like that anymore. We have another vehicle that we have been driving until it dies before going to get a new vehicle because we knew that if we took it anywhere it would amount to thousands of dollars, but we might just bring it there and see what they can do for us. 

I think we have finally found our regular car place."
positive,"Giving them a 5 rating based solely on their service because I haven't purchased vehicles there but have a feeling I will with my next purchase. Our experience with the service department was AMAZING!! I live all the way on the east side and the closest Chevrolet service shop is Fairway Chevrolet. Thanks to fairway Chevrolet Overfilling my vehicle wit ELEVEN QUARTS of motor oil and not following through with a price quote for a transmission flush, I will now do ALL vehicle business with Mark and his OUTSTANDING team at Ed Bozarth. Thank you so much Mark and thank you Ed Bozarth!!! KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO!!!"
positive,"This store is really good! I love the cheep milk! I wish other stores would sell milk that cheep. I shop here often buying groceries here saves me hundreds of dollars a month and thousands a year! I love Kroger brand products and that's a great way to save. The quality in their products is surprisingly often better than fancy expensive grocery stores. They don't have an olive bar, florist, or rotate tires. But honestly I don't need that in a grocery store. The store is handicap friendly. And if Catherine still works there I have to give her a five star rating herself. Because she has gone above and beyond more than once to make sure that many customers myself included had an excellent experience shopping there! Great job Ruler! Thank you! And keep it up!"
positive,"What an experience! Well after my friend was recently in a collision a month prior to my own and was jerked around by the insurance and shops I wasn't looking forward to having my car repaired at all. After much digging I came across Lovetts and decided to give them a go, they were on my recommended list for insurance so I figured they had to be decent. Well let me tell you they were more than decent, Warren is a fantastic guy and didn't rest until all my issues were sorted out, due to the fact that my car is almost all aftermarket parts it creates a bit of a problem whenever I need work done to it, and when we ordered in a new bumper to try to match the rest of the car it came literally wrapped into a ball! Well warren and his crew didn't let this deter them and they straightened it out magnificently to the point where you really can't tell unless you know what to look for. The amount of hours this took them I know wouldn't be compensated by the insurance so a lot of this was their own time to make sure that I was taken care of, most body shops wouldve just done a bit then slapped paint on to it and called it good blaming the results on the choice of bumper. After this there was a small issue with the aftermarket lights we had to put in so yet again warren went to bat for me and got oem lights approved from the insurance to make sure that they worked without a problem. Overall I wouldn't dare take my car anywhere else in the future, if you need a job done right take it to lovetts, it might not be the quickest but perfection rarely is."
positive,"I was in a minor wreck on Rt. 28, and I pulled in to the first place I could find. It just happened to be Tony's. I explained my check engine light was on and asked for help. One of Tony's mechanics came out to read the code. He took a look at the engine, cleared the code, and helped reassure me that everything would be okay. This was just before closing while they were wrapping up for the day. 

In this day and age, you never know how people will treat you. I was so relieved to have them help me - quickly, unscheduled, and with kindness. I tried to tip the mechanic, but he assure me it wasn't necessary. Unbelievable! 

Give them a try!"
positive,"Took my GMC Yukon here to get my transmission flushed and have the filter replaced. It only cost me $120 vs. the dealerships that wanted to charge me $400. Additionally, the Yukon was veering slightly to the left, so I asked them to look at that while they were working on it. They weren't able to do the alignment there because of the 20"" rims, but they referred me to a place that did it for fairly cheap. 

Downside: waiting room is tiny, and there's no wifi, which is annoying when you're waiting a couple hours."
positive,"Second trip to Frank's, and it is always a very good experience.  Frank is beyond fair, the work is top-notch, and both times the car was delivered on-time as promised.  They get my highest recommendation as getting your car repaired is not the most pleasant task in the world, but Frank makes it as painless as possible.  Everybody in the shop has a great attitude."
positive,"Took our Nissan Altima there when the transmission froze.  Dennis called the dealership and let us know that they had extended the warranty to 10 years on our model, and advised we take our car to the dealer to get it repaired under warranty.  Thank you Dennis for not only treating us very fairly, but actually doing the background work to verify the warranty had been extended."
positive,"Alright. Total, I've had my transmission flushed, oil changed, radiator flushed, brakes, pads and calipers replaced, and front ball joints on my drivers side replaced. I don't know if the employees and management have changed, or what, but I saw none of the behavior or problems that the negative, one star reviews mentioned. Great customer service, the mechanics actually walked me out into the garage to show me every bad part. To me, most honest thing a mechanic has ever/could ever do. So I don't know what these negative reviews are talking about. (Nor is most of what they are saying comprehensible so...)

After all this work done, my car feels better then it ever has. Dillan (Dunno if that's how to spell it) was the kid working on my car. So props to his work. They have competitive prices, and from what I could see while I was watching them work they are thorough. I'll continue bringing my vehicle here. Next I gotta get my battery cables replaced. 

Note: I'm giving 4 out of 5 because of one small thing. When I was shown how bad my ball joints were during my brake job, the guy showing me (pretty sure he's not a mechanic) gave me an off-the-top-of-his-head estimate that was MUCH higher then it should have been. After talking with the mechanic dillan, and the girl that works the counter there a few days later, I found out it was a much more ideal price to get it done. Sooo...lesson learned, get the quote done AT the computer. Not a big deal really. These guys are great."
positive,I do have to say Bret is such a sportsman. I felt great leaving here today knowing my check engine light will be resolved. Only reason it isn't 5 stars yet is I will wait until I get part installed and drive my required 80 miles and pass emissions inspection first. :) I am optimistic with Bret indeed! :) Thanks!!
positive,"These guys have amazing reviews on garagefly so I decided to take a chance on 'em last week. Jeff was really friendly and never tried to up-sell anything. Had a transmission leak that he fixed and honestly, it was about  1/3 of the price I thought it was going to be after researching. Plus, it's running like a brand new car. 

I took it in on a Friday morning and he called apologizing that he'd need to keep it overnight. They're usually closed on Saturday but he actually went in and finished it up the next morning and I had it by noon. Awesome."
positive,Came in for repair work on the muffler system on our 1989 Toyota Corolla and also had them repair a bad front Axel. Great staff and repair was fast and done correctly the first time.
positive,"Fantastic dealership with stellar service department. Great end-to-end service. Moved here from New Jersey two years ago, and one of my concerns was where to service my car. (My former dealership, Prestige Toyota of Ramsey, was wonderful.)

Shouldn't have worried -- Big Two is awesome. Very professional service department with a cool staff who all look like they're happy to go to work every day.  I worked with Chris for my first appointments, and with William most recently, but everyone -- from the greeting staff to the  service advisors to the cashier to the lady at the snack counter to the folks who return the car -- are unfailingly kind and professional. Plus, the dealership has free WiFi; a coffee shop with free fruit, coffee, tea, and breakfast/lunch for purchase; and personal services (for a fee) for a massage and hair/nails.

My windshield cracked last week, and the service department gave me the name of a fantastic local business (Sonoran auto glass) which I've also reviewed.

I can't imagine going anywhere else for service and extended my ToyotaCare service contract through the dealership about four months ago. When my lease ends, I intend to finance the car and purchase it outright as I love this model, but the next time I want to purchase a car I'll go to Big Two."
positive,When I first got my subie I had an evap check engine light code that I couldn't figure out if my life depended on it. I found out about route 69 through flat4lv and took my car to Darin. He immediately found the source of the problem and scheduled me asap to fix it. Was very happy with the service and have been going back since then with questions that are always honestly answered. The fact that he tells you straight up no B.S.  what you need done for future reference is great. Have already been going back for other repairs on the car and each time has been good. I highly recommend anyone with a subaru to come to Darin at route 69.
positive,"A friend of mine kept telling me how wonderful Cary is, and I didn't believe her until I finally took my car to him for some repairs.  

He's efficient, friendly and a great mechanic.  But most of all, he is honest.  He is the most honest mechanic I have ever dealt with.  He will not fix something without calling you first and getting your approval, he will not fix anything unnecessary, and he will tell you when and where it is best for you to spend your money.

For example, I have a 1987 Honda CRX with 270,000 miles.  It has some issues, but overall is a decent car.  I had been told by many people, friends and mechanics, that I needed a new transmission and that to rebuild the transmission would easily cost over $1000.  Cary looked at it and told me that it would cost $700 to fix a couple of different issues, including the clutch, but not the transmission.  He recommended for me to not get the transmission rebuilt on a car with so many miles, because it would probably cause more harm than good.  The CRX has been running great ever since.

Everyone has come to expect that mechanics are shady, yet Cary is almost honest to a fault.  So I tell everyone how great he is so that he can get more business to make up for the fact that he doesn't screw anyone over."
positive,I got a check engine light on my Miata the day before I left Sacramento for Phoenix. I wasn't going to miss seeing my Son so drove the 800 miles. Once in Phoenix I researched Miata service on Yelp and saw good reviews for Mikes Place. I knew I was at the right place when I saw all the Miatas out front and in their service bays. Mike and Ann were fantastic and easy to talk to. They confirmed it was a Barometric Pressure sensor that went bad. New from the Dealership is well over $200 if they even stocked it for my 17 year old car. Mike had a good but used one on the shelf for $35. I changed it out and no more check engine light plus no big repair bill. It truly is a Miata Mecca (their E-Bay Business name :-)
positive,"I went to a local oil change location late yesterday afternoon and they informed me that my transmission fluid was over the limit and that it may be hazardous to my car.  They recommended that I contact Aamco or another company.

So, first thing this morning I called Aamco and they said they'd take a look at the car.  Just a heads-up, don't wait in the garage reception area to be helped ... I later learned that the office was just a door down.  When I arrived, I spoke with a very kind & helpful guy - I believe his name was Nate.  

I'm so glad that I brought my 8-yr old, 90k-mile car here.  They were very professional, courteous and timely.  After they drained my transmission fluid, it was determined that I had over a quart in excess (not sure if that makes a big difference, but I just want to be safe since this is my only mode of transportation).  In addition, I'm always concerned as a consumer especially since I'm a less knowledgeable female when it comes to auto care.  That's why I normally bring my dad with me so I don't have to deal with b/s.  Fortunately, that wasn't the case with this location, I never felt like I was being taken advantage of - their service was superior!

After such a positive experience, I would not hesitate returning to this Aamco compared to other Aamco locations for future service!  Thanks guys!"
positive,"Found my new oil change home here.
Straightforward work and no pushy overselling.  Not even a transmission flush was suggested..... :)

Was pleased to overhear an employee explain to a customer that synthetic allows you to drive well over 3,000 miles- closer to 6,000.  I have never overheard this at a shop.  Thank you for your honesty.

I made an appointment so I didn't anticipate my oil change and rotation to take over an hour with the shop not seemingly packed, but if quality work takes a little longer and I'm not paying for a 15 minute change I'm certainly not going to get in a huff."
positive,"Got my husband a 500.00 gift certificate for Christmas.. he called Friday to set up appt for today 3/19/2017. They said couldn't take appt because they had no access to schedule and my husband wanted to request a certain driver. (He had a friend who had done this previously). 
So, he called back yesterday and booked the Ferrari 488 and the Porsche gt3rs. Done for 1130. 

Get there and are told the Ferrari is down due to transmission issue and so he asked for the f 12 and it's also broken. I sensed his extreme dissatisfaction and said, let's just reschedule. He choose to settle after the salesman stated they had tried to call everyone and let them know yesterday. Well we had made appt yesterday... so he said well we called late. NOONE ever called me. 

Bear in mind that we dropped another 300! To do the cars that my husband wanted. So he did his 2 cars and then we go up to add drifting and had 60.00 more out cause for some reason that's what he thought it costs. But was told no, 99.00 so he said, ok nevermind , maybe throw it in since my car I really wanted was down, the guy checking is out, said ""you got 3 extra laps"" ... we said oh, ok... didn't think so,,, but we got the video and no extra laps at all. So that was a direct lie. While I agree nothing is free in life BUT issue is that it is a very expensive indulgence and my husband was set on this car that even the day before he had booked. 

I'm super disappointed cause I really wanted him to enjoy it but he settled. My husband has raced autocross before and is super into cars, he knew what he wanted and absolutely settled. Had we been informed we would have spent the 800 another day. 

That said my husband said he wants to try a diff place and see if he can get what he wants cause this is way to much money to not have gotten what he had his heart set on."
positive,"Our family has been having our cars serviced at Big Two for many years. The service department is always friendly and helpful, especially Juan Ramirez, and being a 'car guy' I'm happy that they don't try to sell me services or repairs that I don't need. The waiting area is comfortable and staffed by friendly folks.  I recently decided it was time to replace my car after 17 years and 195,000 miles. I looked at several brands and models but ultimately chose a new Toyota based on the great deal that salesmen Jason Dicken, Khoi Do and Rusty Anderson were able to get me and the fact that this allows me to continue my service relationship with Big Two. They even went so far as to locate one of the FEW Corolla iMs in the Valley with a manual transmission and send someone to retrieve it from Avondale for me. I'd highly recommend this dealership to anyone anytime."
positive,"There's the market and then there's the restaurant. The restaurant is really a counter in the market. There are several tables to eat at, or you can take it to go

The market is pretty nice. There's an excellent variety of middle eastern products including a halal meat counter where you can get any part of a lamb you want. The place is clean and spacious and the prices are pretty good. 

The food in the restaurant I can only judge by the kefta sandwich that I ordered. My he kefta kebab sandwich was perfect!

I love in LA and found this place only because I was getting my car repaired nearby, but I wish it were closer to my house. I'll try to visit every time I'm in Las Vegas."
positive,"Paul was a great guy, I was in a bad situation with my work truck and they rushed me in and replaced my clutch, rear main seal, and rebuilt the broken parts in my transmission. I have a ZF6 speed manual transmission and they got me in and had it all fixed and back onto the road within two days. Very impressed with their customer service, speed, and quality of work."
positive,"On a scale of 1 to 5, where  5 is ' Excellent ...........Robinson is a 6 !!!

Here's how I came to know of Robinson. While I'm not in any way mechanically inclined, I spend considerable time on various Internet auto forums trying to educate myself about  repairs and maintenance in general and my vehicle in particular. It's while spending time on GTA based forums that I first became aware of Robinson. In response to people looking for honest and trustworthy mechanics, Robinson kept getting recommended along with glowing reviews time and time and time again on virtually every forum I would visit. And when I mentioned Robinson to friends, co-workers, clients etc. some of them knew of Robinson as well - some driving 30 - 50 km one way just to get there. The words honest, trustworthy, great diagnostics and amazing customer service would be cited all the time. So, I started thinking - who ARE THESE GUYS ??? Whoever they were, it's was pretty obvious they had an amazing and well earned reputation and their reputation preceded them - BIG TIME ! .So I checked out their web-site, noticed they had their own cable show and started tuning in on a regular basis and was thoroughly impressed not only with their knowledge, but with the honesty, integrity and professionalism they approach auto repair. Since we live 40 km away and our family and extended family had been using the same mechanics for over 20 years, I thought I'd never have to check Robinson out.

All that changed when our vehicle had warning lights come on indicating  symptoms of possible transmission problems. Our mechanics scanned some basic codes and concluded that owing to it's age. etc, it likely needed a rebuilt transmission some point in the future. Given our mechanics were honest but didn't have a lot of diagnostic equipment or direct transmission experience, I sought out a second opinion. After getting suggestions from other on-line GTA owners of my vehicle, I found another shop with an impeccable reputation with  ' alleged ' transmission savvy and they too scanned some codes and concluded I would need a new ' rebuilt ' transmission ' soon '. No one knew when ' soon ' would be , so I felt like I was driving a ticking time bomb !!!!. When I checked the codes on the on-line forum for my vehicle, same prognosis - ' rebuilt ' transmission. 'The estimated cost of a ' rebuilt ' transmission ? $4,000 !!!! I felt sick. 

As a desperate last resort, I made the 40 km drive ( by-passing 6 dealerships much closer to me ) and  took my vehicle to Robinson. Kirk did all the diagnostic work on my car, spending much more time on diagnostics than either of the 2 previous shops I'd been to. Good thing he did - because of Kirk's expertise and the thorough diagnostic methodology he follows, it ended up my problem was only that a  part  costing $123.26 needed to be replaced. A $123.26 part  - versus -  a $4,000 ' rebuilt ' transmission !!!!!. I was stunned...in a good way ! Kirk,even took me into the shop and with his laptop, walked me through all the steps he took to nail down the problem. Kirk also spent considerable time showing me other pressing and less urgent issues pertaining to my vehicle that required attention. The customer service and expertise at Robinson was simply - in a word - astounding !.

And on that note, perhaps the only person who can match Kirk when it comes to customer service and expertise is Mike at the front desk. To say that Mike has an encyclopedic  knowledge of auto repair and maintenance would be an gross understatement. I've joked with Mike that each time I drop by for service, I learn more ' accurate information ' about my vehicle in a 5 minute chat with him than I do spending a  week on a  on-line forum dedicated to my vehicle. Apart from that, Mike is great at explaining ' exactly ' what does and what doesn't need to be done during a visit, and as another reviewer mentioned, because of Mike's honestly and integrity, you can rest assure only work that needs to be done is getting done.

And as another reviewer mentioned it's absolutely amazing that when you've had a chance to sit in Robinson's waiting room and chat with other  customers about how far they've driven just to get their vehicles serviced there, you realize you're not alone. Like me, they often mention they go Robinson for the value - the best service you can get for your dollar. I know of a lot of others who ignore value and just look for the cheapest service they can find - like a $19.95 oil change. Trouble is, not all oil and not all oil filters are the same. More often than not, cheap service, like cheap wine - will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  Warren Buffet got it right  "" Price is what you pay. Value is what you get "".

I doubt there is a more honest and competent auto service shop in Toronto. And, quite frankly, if Robinson can't diagnose and repair your vehicle properly the first time - then no one can.

Robinson is THAT GOOD !"
positive,"Marshal is an amazin mechanic and a wonderful human being. 3 weeks ago I was on a road trip from sf to lv, to valley of fire, to zion national park, to the grand canyon and back. got a check engine and transmission flashing light in vegas. I found marshall right here on yelp and he was the most honest mechanic Ive ever met. checked my code free of charge and sent me on my way, assuring me that the problem was minor: speed sensor. he didnt try to take advantage of me, knowing I was traveling and not from the area. He most definitely couldve done so very very easily. I would have paid whatever he had requested. 

marshall is a one man operation, which volvo is trying to shut down. he needs equipment to better serve the cliets. I say a fund should be started to get him what he needs. Honest mechanics are a dieing breed and everything should be done to ensure Marshall's survival."
positive,"Although this place mainly fixes transmission, they also do other repairs. The place is small, but the staff was friendly. There are no waiting room, just a small office with one desk inside. They try to fix the cars as they come in, and not hold anything overnight. I was waiting for my car when a guy came in and said his car died as he pulled up, and if they could fix it and he will come back tomorrow to pick it up. The mechanic said he does not have the space to store the car. So it will be done by end of day. 

I was refer here by a family member, who has his car fix, and then my mom's car transmission was fixed here, and then came mine. The owner/ mechanic is honest with you. That's what EVERYONE wants, an honest mechanic. Pay for what you need to get fix (even though, it might hurt the pocket book at at times, but cars are expensive to fix nowadays) but at least you get an honest opinion. 

And this place came highly recommended. I even talked to another customer who also brought his car in the same day, he comes here every time."
positive,Oh I'm so happy I found these guys! They rebuilt my transmission over a year ago on my 07 Ford F-150 and it runs perfect. They don't try to up sell you or try to make you spend money on something that doesn't need to be done. I'm getting my brakes done on Monday and they are checking my moms car over for free. Thank you J and L for taking care of me!
positive,Great reliable experience! Best quotes & fast service! Recommend to anyone with foreign automobile ! My Honda Accord transmission was completed in one day after part was ordered!! Thx Alexei
positive,"My husband took my car in about a couple weeks ago and got a transmission flush, oil change and car wash. This morning we realized the dipstick wasn't in the transmission hole and there was fluid everywhere. My husband and I immediately went back in and they were so nice. They redid the transmission flush, gave a full refund and another car wash. We will definitely come back because Noah and the GM for the oil change place took care of us so well. They didn't have to do all that but they did and definitely will continue to get services done by them"
positive,"One of Toronto's best kept secrets? 

Cuisine of India, sandwiched between a now-defunct muffler shop and a paint store on a nondescript, windswept block of Yonge Street between Finch and Sheppard Avenues, may not strike the casual observer as a likely candidate for best Indian restaurant in Toronto.

But my wife and I, having tried many others in town (e.g., Amaya, Kamasutra, Indian Kitchen, Dhaba, Babur, Kama, Bombay Bhel, Rangoli, etc.), keep coming back home to Cuisine of India.  In our view they've got the best naan by far.  And it seems to be the only place in town where I can get murgh tikka lababdar: a delicious chicken dish in-the-pot with a coriander-spiced cream sauce that makes my mouth water just typing about it.

My wife the vegetarian loves the palak paneer (spinach with a cream sauce) and the mattar paneer (mushroom in a tomato sauce).

Definitely worth seeking out."
positive,Thank you sooo much Alex for helping me with my check engine light today. I will definitely be back with my Nissan Armada. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
positive,"The service at this location was excellent! I had an emergence on my way to Las Vegas in that my windshield cracked unexpectedly, I called ahead for help  to make sure they had a replacement and immediately got a positive response. Upon arrival for my appointment at this location, the technician took care of me. He inspected my vehicle, told me what the process would be and estimated 1 to 1-1/2 hours wait. I viewed the installation and he was very careful with my vehicle to make sure no damage would occur. I truly recommend Safelite Auto Glass and this location for anyone in need of auto glass repair."
positive,"When I had my Jaguar, Otto was the first mechanic I met that did not look at me like a walking mortgage payment when I walked in the door. A couple of the jobs that he did for me were about a third of what I was quoted by Jaguar Calgary. When he replaced parts in my car he showed me the parts he took out and what was wrong with them. No one has done that for me since, well, my dad. Even though he complained to me bitterly about how expensive Jaguar parts were every time I was there, I loved it because of the charming way he said 'Yag-u-arr'.
I drive by his shop sometimes on my way to work and I often see him in his yard walking around cars with his customers, often young men, and I think the work he does, mentoring people about their cars and taking time with them is so much greater than the very excellent work he does with automobiles.
If he doesn't know how to fix your car, he knows someone who does. Otto is the guy that knows the guy which is so much more important than knowing everything. I needed work done on my transmission that he admitted he did not know how to do. He asked me, ""You want cheap, or you want best?"" I told him I wanted the best, so that 's what he got me; he called some poor guy out of retirement at Chestermere to fix my car, and I have no doubt it still cost me less than what I would have paid at the dealership.
Easily the best experience I have ever had with a mechanic in my life. Much love for Otto and his lovely wife!"
positive,"I LOVE my Mazda! We bought it here two years ago and I wasn't ready to give it up quite yet, but we're expecting a baby and knew I needed a Mom car. At the same time, my husband also needed an upgrade as his car is a two door and not baby friendly. We had very specific needs for both cars that we were not willing to compromise on, and we were also specific on finances since we were doing two cars at once. Luckily we worked with Eddie who helped get us exactly what we needed. At the end of a very long day for us and the sales people to get us numbers that worked for us, we left happy and the proud owners of a CX-5 for me and a manual transmission 3 for my husband. We started buying cars 7 years ago and the first couple times, we left feeling taken advantage of (elsewhere, not here). We've learned a lot and truly feel like we got the best deal possible here after all of our experiences (and confirmed by my stepdad who sold cars his whole career.) I feel like Eddie worked really hard to get us what we wanted with as fair a deal as possible. Definitely recommend asking for them if you're considering a Mazda - which you absolutely should because ""Mazdarati's"" are AWESOME!"
positive,"Service center is amazing. I went there for a 45k mile inspection, minus a tire rotation, oil change, or filter change because they were not needed. The gentleman there, Brian Zasloff, told me it'd be an hour to an hour 15. After an hour I walk up to the desk, he had my keys and I could see my car outside. He said my tires were at 50%, which is better condition than I thought. He gave me a quote on new tires, which was nice to know. They had done everything thing I asked, including a 34 point inspection, as well as a recall install on the shift cable clip for the transmission. So everything was good, then I walk outside and see my car that needed a wash, had been washed by the nice people at Centennial Hyundai. I spent nothing, but received a bit more peace of mind that my vehicle was in a great condition, and a free car wash. They didn't have to be so awesome but they were. Great experience. Very happy I bought my vehicle from them. Thank you! If someone that works there reads this, please personally thank their service team. (UPDATE: great service, especially after dealing with my current dealer. Wish I was in Las Vegas to buy from these people again.)"
positive,"So first things first, this place is a full service garage, they do much more than brakes alone. I've brought my car here for over 8 years and once I started coming here my cars have never been anywhere else. 
As many reviews mention Don is great, I've never once felt like he was trying to up sell me or do a repair that wasn't necessary. Last week my car had a check engine light on and was driving terribly, it had the symptoms of a much more serious problem than the sensor it turned out to be. I feel confident other garages might have tried to make it out to be much more, but not Brake Masters. 

This used to be the shop near my house and that's how I started going here, now I live in the other side of town but I'll always make the drive across town and always bring my cars here."
positive,"This place is AWESOME!!  The staff and management is very personable and takes care of their customers from beginning to end. Since this was my first time having being hit and trying to find somewhere that would repair my BMW, this place exceeded my expectations. I didn't want just anyone repairing my black beauty but after speaking with Don Hill the Manager he made me feel very comfortable with leaving my car there. Here's the best part, they even gave her a good clean inside and out which I thought was icing on the cake and something I didn't expect. If you're looking for somewhere to have your car repaired after an accident, I would suggest this place. If I ever have to get my car fixed, I'm definitely going back here.  Thank you New Look!"
positive,"Just went in with a check engine light issue,  they ran the diagnostics and thought it was the gas cap.  They didn't charge me a dime to fix the problem.  I Always go here for oil changes and any other issues because of their honesty and integrity.  I can't recommend them enough!"
positive,"I've used this facility on a number of occasions (unfortunately for me). They have always been very honest and reliable, going above and beyond what you'd normally expect. They are a top notch facility and have always stood behind their work.

On one occasion the mechanic on duty actually drove to our broken down car's location, contacted a tow truck, took my wife to work and then had the car repaired by the time she got off work. I was shocked to see that the entire bill was less than I expected to pay for the tow alone. I will always use this facility for my automotive work."
positive,I brought my car in because I thought I heard a wobble at low speed. I was able to get an appointment right away. They looked at my car and determined that the CVT makes that sound at low speed and rpm and that it is normal. They looked at my car for close to an hour and did not charge me. I felt bad for wasting their time and offered to pay for the labor hours. Tyler was the dealership representative and he refused.  Earlier last year this same dealership replaced my CVT transmission under warranty. The reason that is remarkable beyond the fact that a transmission replacement is a major job was that I had previously taken the vehicle to 4 other dealerships where I was told that nothing was wrong with my car when I knew that there were major issues. I am definitely impressed with the service and honesty I have experienced here.
positive,"I took my 2015 Kia soul here when I was rear ended in an accident.  I had to use my own insurance due to the driver that hit me was an excluded driver on the policy.  Allan did a great job preparing me for the upcoming events of dealing with an insurance estimator and their practices.  He inspected my cars damage and wrote up an estimate.  Everything that he told me to watch for occurred with the insurance estimator.  When I was ready to bring the car in for repairs... Allan called Enterprise and had an employee, from Enterprise,  pick me up at the shop and drive me over to the rental car office.  Once the rear bumper was removed a supplement repair order was issued for extra damage.  Allan had told me that these items would need repaired in the initial consultation and that the insurance companies estimator wouldn't find them to be damaged or would over look them.  My car was ready on the day promised and even 5 hours early.  My car was repaired to look like new and the paint matched perfectly.   I would recommend, to anyone, to trust LG Collision. These guys do great work and truly look out for you, the customer, first.  They stand behind their work and craftsmanship. Personally,  I didn't want to have my car repaired at an insurance company recommended body shop.  Those shops have the insurance companies best interest as a priority. ...not the customer. I will use these guys again and refer anyone needing a body shop to LG Collision.   Thanks again , great job Allan and the whole crew!"
positive,"This place was previously named something else but now it has a FRESH NEW Upgraded Look  and Feel and complete MakeOver. 
I Love  the new set up and the staff is extremely friendly and informative for the most part. 
I've only used them for vehicle inspections and the system they have in place for appointments is pretty cool. There is a board (electronic) with the first name and last name initial and appointment time listed. If you are there your name is turned to Green to show that you have arrived and waiting.
I arrived 2 minutes before my schedule appointment and approached right behind another person checking in. I was welcomed when I approached and the rep asked for the keys and headed out with his scanner to scan in my vehicle. I was then told it would be 30-45 mins so I proceeded to the seating area and got online as I have a couple of businesses and need to be online. The WiFi is Free which is cool, it isn't the fastest but I was able to shell out a couple emails. 

The inspections are based on the year of the car which I didn't know. I was happy to only pay $13 since I have a 2017. My only hiccup is the phone holding, I called in to make the appointment and was told to hold on and was on hold for over 15 minutes and hung up and called right back to be told they forgot I was on hold. My other issue is the fact that I was given incorrect information over the phone regarding a waiver for inspection on my teenager car who is away at college and the car would fail due to the check engine light. I was told to bring it in and they would do the waiver so on the day of my appointment for the 2017 I reminded the guy that as soon as he finishes the 2017 I would need to run home to switch cars and bring the 2006 for the waiver to register and at that point I got a totally different LONG and tedious process that I needed to go through including going to Huntersville DMV & spending hundreds to show proof that I tried to fix the light and more. 
If I would've been told that the week before when I called to make the appointments I would've just took the car to have the issue resolved which I was avoiding due to her not being home to drive it so doing the $600 in repairs was just extra."
positive,"What amazing service. They have put two transmissions in two trucks for me and I have always experienced excellent professional service. Bob is a great guy and very fair. Most importantly, great time lines. As promised. Bob doesn't make excuses. If you need any transmission service, this is the place to go."
positive,"Usually I hate getting my car repaired by someone and I end up doing it myself. Since I live in a apartment with no garage, that's not an option for me unfortunately.

I took Yelp's advice and checked out Mr. Brake. I got my both my brakes and rotors done for a really great price and he did them in less than an hour. I knew that my brakes and rotors were really bad already, and the owner actually had me come out and showed me what was left on my rotors to assure me that what they were doing was really needed. The lady that was sitting next to me was getting her car checked out because of a noise she was hearing. The employee comes out and tells her there is nothing actually wrong with her brakes and sends her off. No charge. It's good that there are honest businesses out there. 

Mr. Brake is awesome and I would highly reccomend to anyone looking to get their brakes/rotors done."
positive,"I did not have my car repaired here because it was totaled.  But, I got in a pretty nasty car accident and had my car towed here immediately following the accident, as it was the closest collision center to the accident site. My husband picked me up and we followed my vehicle to auto nation.  A younger gentleman with white gauges, I think, named Robert, helped us.  He explained to us what the process was. Asked if I was okay. Gave us his contact information and let us keep my vehicle there until we decided how we wanted to move forward.  He did not pressure us to use auto nation or to make any decisions right then.  We came back two days later to get some items out of my vehicle before they took it away to the car graveyard.  Robert was pretty much the only thing nice about this whole car accident experience and gave us one less thing to worry about."
positive,"We've been taking both of our old clunkers to Paul for years for all our repair needs and can't imagine ever going anywhere else again. He is THE automatic transmission expert but he also manages to fix everything that goes wrong with my stick as well and whatever the problem, he's always ready to accommodate emergencies. We've both been to plenty of dishonest, incompetent, nasty car repair places and are really glad we've found a place that stands behind their work.  And the prices are very reasonable, too!"
positive,"Dropped off my aging Ford Freestyle for a 'get ready for a road' inspection and a 'by the way it makes a clunk sound', and they gave it a complete inspection. I left it for a few days (they dropped me off at the airport with their 3pm shuttle) and when I got back they were like 'your car is fine, come pick it up'.  I asked how much it would cost, and they said, 'it passed all our tests, the transmission looks fine, so no charge'. We talked a bit about what had made the clunk sound and they said sometimes the engine mounts can settle when it sits for a long time, and since it hasn't made the sound since, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. They understand, my car is worth less than a transmission overhaul... not your typical dealer! Also, they washed it. Of course I'm sure they know this is a nice way to get me to buy a car from them someday, but that's the way it's supposed to work -- treat customers well and they'll come back.

So I recommend them. There was a bit of confusion when my car would be ready, but that's pretty normal."
positive,"I took my car here 4 days before it needed to be emissioned and re-registered because my check engine light was on and the problem was any number of about 6 different things. Instead of playing part roulette and fixing each part individually, I took it here, to Chandler West. They charged me $95 to hook it up to a computer, cleaned some sensors, took it through emissions for me and got it to pass. Cost efficient, quick, and very friendly. I highly recommend taking your car here. :)"
positive,"Great hotel (I have been here for 2 years now), and the only real complaint is one the hotel can't do much about, the outside noise. Construction (backup beeps going on all night), loud cars (buy a muffler), fire trucks (fire hall is not too far away) and garbage trucks (at 3 am next door). Windows open, airco works, bathroom fans are getting old and a little loud. Great staff, decent breakfast (crowdy in summer though), but large quiet rooms. With only 14 rooms per floor it is pretty quiet.

Would deduct half a star for the outside noise if I could. 

And did I mention the great staff?"
positive,"Hands off to the women and men that work at this location. Exceptional service each time I walk in with a question about a part or just to ask for recommendations. Honest hard working folks that enjoy their job and helping others.  Today I need to have my car checked for check engine light. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and how can I help. Quickly told me the trouble code and even took it a step further and printed to parts I may have to replace. Store is always well stocked and clean with staff ready to help with anything to get you back on the road safely. 

Defiantly will add them to my xmas list.  If you are looking for car parts or need honest service advise, this is the place to go."
positive,"Where should I start? First off, Armondo here is amazing he does a great job with explaining the issues your vehicle is having and tries to do all he can to get your car fixed right and on time. 
I have a 04' BMW 325i and the transmission was slipping so they did a throughout inspection and sure enough my transmission was completely done. I wasn't looking forward to the repair costs but what do u do??? Armondo suggested I apply with the financing companies they work with to help with costs for my repairs. I applied and it all worked out I was able to get my car fixed and now I'm back rolling lol. 
Thanks AAMCO for hooking my ride up I will come to you for all my car repairs and will always refer people I know to you"
positive,"Fantastic shop where the owner cares about customer satisfaction.
They custom bend pipes and I needed a custom exhaust on my 1971 camaro Z28 

I was quoted double from other muffler shops compared to what Frank the owner charged me 

Great service , fantastic prices 

Thanks frank"
positive,"Serouisly Service Department Couldn't get any better!! I had to take my car in for a transmission issue. I was so frustrated with the problem. This experience completely revived my faith in Nissan. *loyal Nissan owner again*  I was so pleased with the service I am going to switch my regular oil change/maintenace service to Avondale Nissan. I was pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail, one on one service and personal accountability created in the structure of having your own rep. Doug Morris went above and beyond and was so helpful and made recommendations for all my questions and not just when it was a ""money maker"" for Nissan. I have already spoken very highly of the service i received to friends in the area. Thank you so much! Very pleased. I have had my Altima since it was brand new. I am really excited to have a dealership that can take care of it that makes it such a streamlined pleasant experience to keep my car in excellent condition! Can't say enough! Nice to drive away in a car that you know trained eyes have combed for any problems and fixed.I don't know if they did a refurb on their service model because I had received negative feedback from others before but they really outdid themselves. I had to stop and scratch my head a few times and wonder- why are they being so helpful? A good portion of what I had done was under warranty. These guys are my new Nissan best friends. I fell in love with my car all over again but when I am in the market for a new car this will definitely be my first stop!"
positive,"I'm at Midas by 32nd ave ne Calgary...
Bob who is the senior manager is superbly awesome. 
Though I waited for a bit with appt. Its all worth it coz he chatted with me and the time just went by really quick.
I would highly recommend this shop now i waited since they dont have the filter and they got it done so fast he is so nice....look for him. Very awesome service it was my first time.  Being first time with a new car, the engine light came on. And he didn't charged me they just re-scan it and lights off! He explained it to me really nicely why the check engine light is on...maybe because of cold weather we had -28c at one point. Then he told me if the lights come on again then I have to come back again....then. He doesn't believe in asking people to spend money if they don't have to..its really a bonus...appointment is recommended...there are lots of stuff around like memory express, a strip mall... Absolutely go and check it out, they got oil change, tires, anything except body works...just give em a call and see if they do it...thank u midas by 32nd ave...a hidden gem in the n.e. area! Great service!"
positive,"I recently had some damage on my car repaired by these guys and they did a great job!  When I dropped the car off at the insurance company, it looked so bad and I was so embarrassed.  Winners Circle repaired it ahead of schedule and I was pleasantly surprised when I went back to pick it up.  They did such an excellent job that you can't even tell the car had been in an accident!"
positive,I just had my transmission and transfer case done here. The Manager is very knowledgeable and work was done very professionaly and I was always kept in the loop about repairs and cost. they also offer free towing if you get the work done with them.
positive,"Luis is an honest hard working and reliable man. He is a professional and treat you with respect. Best of all he is an expert not just in transmissions but overall mechanical work in any car. I was a wholesale car dealer and have hundreds of cars repaired at his shop. HONESTY is the most important for me. 

I just dropped a car where it wasn't starting this morning. I believed it was the starter. He checked it for 45min then he told me there is nothing wrong with the starter. It is the key that is not programmed for the car. He could have easily changed the starter and charged but he didn't. He charged me nothing. It is very rare to find a quality of technicians nowadays.

Bring your car to 2b Transmission. Honesty, integrity, professionalism, and peace of mind all of that with very reasonable charge. Can't ask for more and I've worked with many shops in the past until I found Louis. You'll be glad you did too."
