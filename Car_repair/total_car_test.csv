1,negative,"i can't tell you how angry i am right now.  i went to huntersville ford yesterday to get an oil change on my commuter car.  paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.
today i had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  as i was getting off of i-85, i noticed the smell of burning oil.  i thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  i didn't hit a stop light until i was almost at my office.  when i stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and i had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.
i pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  i popped the hood only to find the technician did not put the oil filler cap back on!!!  now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course huntersville ford is closed today!!!!
i have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.
i called and left a voicemail, and now i have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so i can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  i will hold huntersville ford responsible for any components that fail as of a result of this.  most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  in fact, i'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.

and no, i did not have other work done... just the oil change.  you had 1 job.... oil change.  no transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.  i hope he remembered to tighten the filter, but i am skeptical at this point.

i can assure you, i will not be taking my car back to that dealership, even though it is right around the corner from my house.  make it right, huntersville ford."
2,negative,"they're working on fixing the problem of the check engine light on the car, hopefully it will get figured.out soon and the issue will be resolved and the check engine light will stay off and the car will run good

fly by night mobile mechanic didn't show when he said he would. several messages left at the car company with no return call as well as a text to an employee with no response. this place sucks and couldn't careless about customers"
3,negative,"my girlfriend just got an oil change done here, she asked that they check the car over because we are going out of town. it is roughly a 100 miles later, 12:21pm, and we stopped for gas. the transmission fluid(measured hot and with the engine running) is not even showing on the dip stick, the belt cracked pretty bad, all the fluids are low there isn't a drop of washer fluid and who knows what else they didn't bother to check."
4,negative,"i bought a audi 4 and it was the worst car i ever bought...check engine light consistently keeps back on, the owner  jacob ""tried "" fixing but couldn't,so i end up fixing it myself with a little research. the car came with a spare tire that was flat,less then a year the rear back window went out,glove compartment hinges broke,fuel gas leak and til now check light still lighting up . before you buy any car,trucks or suv make sure you check every single details on the vehicles and ask for carfax or call your car insurance for a carfax. the audi a4 i bought is a lemon car."
5,negative,"took my transfer case here after talking to jeff over the phone.  seems like a legit place but the work done was half assed.

i brought it in because of a squeaking noise and a rattling sound.  i rebuilt it prior and thought it would be good for a professional to take a look at it.  they couldn't find the problem but told me the best they could do was a bearing kit for $550.  it would take a knowledgable person no more than two to three hours for the job and the kit is about $90 on ebay.  that's a lot of money for labor and they did a sloppy job.

first of all i had to take it back because they spray painted the front of the case where the transmission fluid from the transmission will come into contact.  i had to argue with jeff that i didn't want paint there.  he finally said to take it back and he'll remove it.  also a half assed job because there was still paint that i had to remove myself.  sorry i don't want cheap spray paint dissolved in my transmission.  not to mention the case was brand new and they did not have to paint it.  they also did a poor job spray painting it as they didn't use any masking.(see pictures)  the spray paint is also flaking off.

now i'm about to put the case back in my truck and i check to see if they put the magnet back.  they did not.  now i have to take it back apart and put one back in myself.  more work for me when i paid a professional to take care of it.  also they put too much rtv around the case which the manual says not to do because it could clog up the screen to the oil pump and burn out the bearings.

very poor and unprofessional job by a place that call them self ""pro.""  skip this place and find some one who cares about their work.



*talked to jeff over the phone.  initially, on our very first coversation, he seemed very knowledgable about transfercases.  it become apparent after each conversation his knowledge is very limited.

i told him about the problem and he didn't offer a refund not even an apology, just tried to argue and justify himself.   i hope you think twice before taking your car here.  places like this also give a bad name to good mechanics."
6,negative,"terrible they took advantage of my elderly  mom. they did not even address what she went in for. however, she left after paying $800.00 and her check engine light is still on, so no emissions test for her today their explanation  "" we only do one thing at a time"" what a sorry states of affairs."
7,negative,"this is an update to a previous review. we took our car to another shop to make sure we were not out of line in our suspicions of this location. they were skeptical of what we said. in particular, that any shop would return a car to a customer with a new check engine light and not tell them about it. however, after they looked at it, they agreed and were appalled at the condition our car was returned to us. apparently our car was the talk of the shop because all the mechanics could not believe our car was returned to us in such a way. breather hoses left unattached, the plug in to the car computer pulled out and left dangling, and every single code on our check engine light a result of something they left undone. i've never had a shop tell me to bill another shop for the work they did, but that's exactly what happened here. do not take your car here. they will screw you over big time!!!!-"
8,negative,"just had my truck in for service and they made no mention of the inspection results.  come to find out, the front brakes were down to nothing and should've been replaced at the oil change.  they have been replacing the egt sensors on my f250 at no charge since buying it new in 2013 because it had a service bulletin on it.  now, they won't honor the service bulletin and it's my responsibility.  i've only been taking it in every 7-10,000 miles because the check engine light is on, due to their inability to fix the problem on the supplier-side...but it's now my problem.  also, because of the dealership just slapping new egt sensors on the vehicle, the dpf system needs replaced.  this vehicle only has 124,000 miles on it.  there's no excuse to have to put $8,000 worth of repairs into it.  peoria ford, ford as a manufacturer, and their service representatives are some of the worst i have seen.  they don't advise on anything.  just fix the codes, oil changes, or tire rotations, and send the vehicles on their way. no service at all!"
9,negative,"do not get your car serviced here. take it to another certified land rover repair shop. i took my car in for it's 90k mile service and inspection on june 6, 2018. they recommended i install a new drive shaft and a couple of small issues, but no other major issues.  i planned on keeping the car for a long time so i did all the work they suggested for a total of $2,742. one week after i had the car serviced the water pump failed and caused the engine to over heat. in other words i had major engine failure one week after having the car serviced and an additional repair bill of $2.203. it's now june 26th, 2018 and my check engine light is on. i took it to the dealership and they told me i blew a gasket head when the car over heated. i got an estimate from another repair shop for $6,500. my decision now is to have the car repaired or trade it in for it's scrap value. on june 5th, 2018 i had a perfectly fine running car with no issues, but after $5,000 in repairs and service from land rover las vegas my car is now junk. 

on another note i brought my car in for minor service back in 2016. when the work was complete i went to pick up the car and it was leaking gas under the engine. i'm not talking a few drops of gas, but a full stream of gas was leaking from under the car. it probably leaked about 3-5 gallons in front of the dealership before they could get it to stop. i should have known how crappy their service was then and never used them again."
10,negative,"i've been a customer of their service center for the past 4 years. i've always enjoyed working with my service adviser and felt as though i was taken care of, even if there were mistakes made. during a recent call to schedule my regular oil change i was informed that they opened a new ""quick service"" center at the dealership for such services. great! or so i thought. upon arrival i met my 'new' service adviser for these services. sat for over an hour and half waiting to get my oil changed?!? when my service adviser came back in to get me...nope, he was just coming to tell me all of the other things they wanted to service on the car. i had already listened to this same talk with 2 other customers sitting in the waiting area. they had not even completed my oil change yet. i understand that there is recommended maintenance work based on mileage & age of a vehicle, but why aren't they letting people know up front that these are recommendations?! waiting for 90 minutes (when i had a scheduled appointment) to find out the items, like air filters, transmission flush, etc is recommended as well, is pretty ridiculous and poor customer service.

one of the items recommended was a 'transmission flush' which i decided was worthy of coming back for to have completed. i emailed my service adviser multiple times about the service and cost to make sure that they would be doing an actual flush and not just a fluid change. he assured me that it would be a flush. when i pulled up to have the service completed he informed me that this was a flush and not a service. so, just the fluids would be changed. argh....seriously? this is common industry terminology folks. a fluid change and a flush are not terms that are used interchangeably. they are not the same service and the cost that henry brown buick, gmc wanted for the actual work of a flush was no where near comparable to what other automotive centers charge. i drove away. 

not only has my service adviser (scott usher) been replaced, but they have brought on new people that aren't even that well versed in their own industry. disappointing on so many levels. i like my buick just fine, but without the option of a different dealership, located within in a reasonable distance, to work on it for warranty and basic service needs, i don't think i'll be keeping this vehicle anymore. 

although they may think they are adding value to the customer by having this quick lube center, it has added nothing positive to my experience with this dealership's service center."
11,negative,"my car had a leak and started slow. i paid $1100 for this to be fixed and they were not. i took a day off work to have my car repaired at keffer. it has an oil leak and is starting sluggish. they quoted $1133.40 to do a fuel line flush and to fix the leak. after having the repairs completed and paying i went to my car where it did not start...still on the lot! we went inside and they said we could leave it but since i have to work for a living that was not an option. friday was the earliest i could return. wednesday i get up for work and low and behold there is oil on the ground, thursday fresh oil on the ground, friday fresh oil on the ground. justin had called and said that they would have a loaner car there and ready for me. when i arrive curtis seems to know nothing about this and we end up being there for 35 minutes and he then says we have to fill it back up to where it was on gas or we will be charged $6 a gallon. um, no considering if the job was done correctly the first time i wouldn't need a loaner car and i'm already burning up my gas running back and forth to huntersville from concord. so curtis eventually calls telling us that it needs a fuel pump and that it will be $580 and that they can't find a leak and think it's just ""excess oil"". this is unacceptable. so we speak with justin who first offers us a $150 credit then a $220 credit. really? we just paid for $1100 worth of services we didn't need and we are expected to pay another $360 to $580 in charges again to maybe get the job right this time? then when i go into the service department to pick up my car, i am in the middle of speaking with curtis and a salesman comes running in and rudely cuts off our conversation so he can say ""i'm about to sell this car can you have it ready by 5?"" really? i've already wasted 2 days here and now i have to waste another 10minutes because this rude salesman can't wait his turn? from the first time i drove a jetta i loved it. all of the people i encountered had been great and i always said i would drive nothing other than a vw and my teenagers 1st car would be a vw but after this experience my opinion has drastically changed about vw. this will be my last vw. i want nothing to do with the service department and anything period with vw. we have a mechanic that we know and trust but i wanted to take my car to a vw service department and what i feared happened....i was screwed out of my $1100 and my car still doesn't function properly"
12,negative,"not sure where to begin with this story which happens to be 100% true and happened on august 23, 2014.  first to just get it out of the way robert ostos the general sales manager and this dealership are totally unethical, untruthful and irresponsible.  do not ever buy a car from these people ...they lie.  after meeting mr. ostos in the lot he talked me into test driving the pop 500 ... i did just  that and decided it  could be a car for my daughter if the price was right.  i  went in to their office and they offered me the car for 14,000 new 2014 ....i countered with 13,200 and after a while they accepted my offer ...except the same car i test drove was being sold to a couple sitting 4 feet from me....and the car is longer available and they  have no other auto-matic transmissions to sell.  but they would find me a used car with low mileage ..except the 3 used cars (2012's) all had more than 35,000 miles.  after aimlessly walking around the lot with a new sales guy on the job for the first day....he found a  2015 and again after another delay came back with  the key and an offer of $21,000 more then a 50% jump from the previously accepted offer of 13, 200.  they basically just waited for us to leave not caring one bit  about the underhanded treatment ...my guess is the other older couple was willing to pay full price and they decided to sell  the car out from under us....  shameful.  i found another  dealer in the lv area and the same car and  dealt with one of the most professional teams i have ever  bought a  car from.  in las vegas ..towbin fiat on jones ave off sahara...did the deal in less then 2 hours out the door.  very professional and honest.  they do  not work on commissions  its all about customer service!!!  never buy a car from findlay fiat ...you will regret it.... unless you like to deal with shady characters."
13,negative,"fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice . . . let me start by saying i applaud woodie's for doing a freon fill before suggesting more expensive repairs on the ac system on my car. still $618 in diagnosis and repairs later and my car still isn't fixed. one member of the staff was rude, condescending and arrogant. in the past we had taken a car for repair, and while it was repaired properly, my wife felt like they were rude and condescending. regardless it's our neighborhood garage so we figured we would give it another go.

we brought the car in for three issues, ac not cooling, check engine light, and a tire problem. the only thing we were not prepared to do was buy a new set of tires. after the diagnosis, they called me back with estimates to do a dyed freon fill (to diagnose a leak in the system), four new tires and to fix the problem causing the check engine light. it would appear though that the person i spoke with to approve the repairs took my rejection of the tires as ""don't repair the check engine light either"" and thin sing-songily informed my wife when she came to pick up the car that i knew better than he when it came to fixing cars. there was a note on the invoice that the ""repair"" may not keep the light off which of course it didn't because it wasn't in fact repaired."
14,negative,"i'm so frustrated with this place! i used them previously and had a great experience, so when i needed my car repaired again it was the fist place i went. the customer service has been terrible, and i was quoted for a repair that went from $165, to $500 and now i'm told over $3,000! i can choose to not pay for the additional repair but then my car will not come back to me and have correct placement on the front bumper. really!!! it's 2 weeks before christmas and i have no idea what to do, i don't have $3,000 plus to spend, but my bumper fit on the car fine when i dropped it off and now it will have a gap. do yourself a favor and take your car somewhere else."
15,negative,this place replaced my  transmission and now i have both an engine light on and the ignition tumbler is completely butchered. they even wrote on the key that the ignition key was in the ignition and that the key that was given to them was the key for the door. stay away from this place unless you want more problems than good.
16,negative,"last year i brought my car there for service asking for a transmission flush because i didn't know how long it's been since the car- previously owned had one and i felt as if the transmission was slipping.  i've had cars in my days to know when the transmission is going out.  at only 70k i had to get a new transmission for my 2007 vw jetta wolfsburg edition.  my point is, i went to them with these exact statements, instead they steered me into an $1100 worth of ""maintenance"" that would fix my driving problem.  it didn't fix the problem, so i had to go back the next week to get a new transmission which was $4000.  i think as a female i was taken advantage of, even though i had specific reasons that it was my transmission.  the two pieces of paperwork that i have makes no sense.  the first one, it said customer concerned about transmission- found no transmission problem.... second paperwork, customer concerned about transmission- needs new transmission.  justin beardley the manager did not ever apologize to me and he did not accommodate me even after i emailed vwusa.  so, i will not be buying another vw.  i am not buying from keffer.  instead i am going for something else that gives better service and have better resale value.  thank you keffer vw!  merry christmas to you justin!"
17,negative,beware!!! make sure you know what youre paying for! in the time spand of a year i've taken my car into brake master twice and both times they changed my transmission fluid and charged me over 100 dollars. i later found out that transmission fluid only needs to be changed every 50-60k mikes yet they found it necessary after 2k. what they told me was a complete lie.
18,negative,"the salesman was not pushy  and was nice,but the quality of the car left lots to be desired.t he check engine light kept coming on after i bought it.the repair tech said it was a bad coil.they did replace all 8 coils,(which took them 4 days) and somehow managed to put 400 miles on my car while taking it to the ""dealer"" to be fixed.after finally getting the car back the check engine light came on again!this was after driving it for 20 minutes.when i called to let them know,they gave me attitude and acted like they did me a huge favor by fixing the coils in the first place.car was still under the 15 day 500 mile warranty,so i told them they need to fix it.turned out it was a bad cattaylitic converter.i had to really fight to have them fix it.they tried to say it was probally just a bad sensor.i explained to them that i had a mechanic look at it and it was the converter.so they only replaced one of the 2 converters,and made a big deal about it like i was being unreasonable wanting it fixed!!also it took them a week to fix it!!.t hey had the car more than i did for the during the first 2 weeks after i bought it.i suspect they were trying to let the warranty run out.(hence the 400 miles they put on it,and keeping it for almost 2 weeks).so when i finally got the car back,it seemed alright.little did i know,that they did absoloutely no tune up,service,or oil change like every dealer is supposed to,when you buy.t he change oil light came on 1 day later.i checked the oil and it was low.the car takes synthetic oil,which ranges from $60 to $80 per change.t he battery died 2 days after sale.the repair man lied and said i left the dome light on.i have never even used the dome light because this happened right after i  got it back from the first,in the series of repairs,and had not even driven the car at night,or for more than 4 hours.(since they were the ones in possession of it for ""repairs"").so when i called them to tell them that my battery died,they had the nerve to tell me that ""i can call a tow truck and pay for it myself!!!!!.i refused,and they did end up paying for the tow.all they did was charge the battery and fabricate a story about the dome light being on.at this point,they were getting really rude and nasty towards me.excuse me,but they shouldn't be selling cars with bad batteries in the first place!!!!.and to try and blame me was ridiculous!!!!oh and once i got the car on a lift while i was replacing the bad battery (at $160 might i add).my mechanic showed me how bad my tires were.t he metal was sticking out and they were splitting!!!!all 4 of them!!!!! which i should've noticed earlier,but having the car in my possession so rarely during the first 2 weeks after the sale,and not being able to see the damage until it was on a lift,i somehow didn't notice.so $600 later,i got 4 new tires.as the old ones were 'extremely dangerous""also,the check advanced tracking light recently came on,and will not turn off.my mechanic says its because the wrong vin# is programmed into car.the cars's a lincoln ls,so repairs ,maintenance,and oil changes are not cheap.they should've done all those things when they were supposed to.the last straw for me,was that it took them a month and a half to give me my license plate and registration.everytime i'd call and ask for it,i got yelled at,and told i'll get em.no time frame or estimate or anything!!i was just worried because the temp plate was going to expire soon,and i didn't trust them to get it to me on time.well after i demanded my plates ,i finally got em.but.....i noticed they're only good for 8 months!!!!???wtf???every time i register a car,it's either 1 or 2 years,not 8 months.so i've had the car a little over a month,and have had to put $1000 into it for things that aaron automotive should've done.oh,and did i mention my mechanic thinks the transmission is going???yeah,i def do not reccomend.oh and the car was not even detailed when i very first picked it up after the sale.really?????,aaaron automotive,really????????"
19,negative,"what a shit show... 
i normally would let something like this go but it really bugged me. i drove up and needed a oil change and smog. i spoke to a gentleman in glasses and told him this information. i asked for the usual oil change that included the car wash. he said okay and showed me inside. i need to mention i have a turn to start car and always leave my key near the speedometer. after sitting down and grabbing a drink i was asked about my key, i explained it was in the dash and they just needed to turn to start. he then questioned, are you sure? yes, i am. ugh, whatever it's cool. i then was brought over by another gentleman with glasses to talk about all the things i need and such, they found a leak which was helpful and he said he would be done shortly, so i asked him about the smog. he said and i quote, ""oh, i wish you would have told me that first."" you got to be kidding. i did tell the guy. alright its cool. i told him its gonna get done right... well, the manager, i assume, cashed my out around $40 for the oil change and i asked if it included the smog to which he replied, ""you need a smog?"". you can understand my frustration and the fact i told him to forget it and give me my key. also i don't believe they filled the air in my tires, they are all still low. get it together people. just another quickie lube that doesn't care about customer service.

**update**
i had my mechanic check out my car and there was no oil leak and/or transmission leak, so that means either 1. the don't know what the fuck they are doing or 2. they lied. you tell me what you think......"
20,negative,"beware... this transmission shop is owned by a bunch of crooks. get a second opinion, better yet do not take your car there.  i had my 2005 pathfinder towed there to get an estimate/inspection.  i was initially quoted $1000-$1250 and was told that worst case scenario if there were hard/core parts needed to be replaced it would be $1750. i gave authorization for my transmission to be removed and inspected. i was then quoted $2800 due to a major component needing replacement ""they called it a tcm"".
all parts to my transmission were shown to me in person the next day while the personel explained the issue. i was then shown an exact transmission to an identical pathfinder on the lot which had broken/melted silinoids/valves that was shown to me to make a comparison.  i decided to get a second opinion the next day and asked the shop to load my car as-is.  the shop denied my request and said there was a $1500 tool holding-up my engine and would not let the tow truck driver load my vehicle.  the tow truck driver lefti paid their fee in full $430 for removing my transmission, but they did not want to give me back my vehicle. after an hour of argueing they pushed my car to the parking lot and had 2 employees load the parts on the trunk.  i looked at the parts loaded and they loaded the other broken/melted valve component instead of the correct one. i was very upset when i noticed this and demanded that they give me the correct parts.  they acted as if i didnt know what i was talking about and played dumb.  i locked my vehicle and was about to leave, when the 2 employees came to me and said by the way ""the main drive shaft and about 5-10 other parts"" were not in the trunk.  i let them put the rest of the parts in and left.  the new shop received the car later that afternoon and stated ""they had never seen anything like this before.  needless to say, they forgot to give me the main screws to close-up (put together the transmission) which i had to go back and get two days later because the dealer doesn't just sell these by themselves and when i picked them up, the employee there ""ray"" said ""by the way here's your catalytic converter, we didn't put it in your car"".  they are unorganized, liers and they have 16 complaints (8 this year) already with the better business bureau.   hope this helps someone, this mistake just cost me $3600."
21,negative,"went for an oil change. gabe called and said i had leaking axle seal and power steering line, wanted to charge my wife over $1,000. since i don't have time to maintain my wife's car, i paid it. he also wanted to charge me an extra $250 to change the brake fluid and transmission fluid. i went to a repair shop later, and he said those 2 fluids were ok as is. makes me wonder about the $1k i blew."
22,negative,never come to this auto shop again. my check engine light went on right after an oil change here.
23,negative,this review is long over due. i went there for a smog check and an oil change. they told me that the smoked failed and that the check engine light was on. total lie!!! i keep my truck maintenance and the check engine light was never on. he then started going on with what is wrong with my truck and i stopped him and told him to just do the oil change and thats it. i stood right outside watching every step they did to the oil change because i did not trust them. i will never go back and do not reccommend this place to anyone. the next day i want to smog busters and passed the smog and i did nothing to the truck. stay away from this place.
24,negative,"i took my car to rebel automotive after seeing all the great reviews they had. my car was driving very roughly. when i brought it in they were kind enough to drive me back to my work so i didn't have to sit there. they stated they replaced my compressor, power steering pump and the belt. unfortunately, once they had completed the work, which cost me $1,200, my engine light turned on again after a few days. i took my car to another mechanic for a second opinion and they found that the power steering pump had not been replaced as stated by rebel automotive that they had. also the mass air flow sensor which is connected to the air intake was disconnected without cause and not related to the problems they diagnosed and repaired. this disconnection resulted in a check engine light a couple days later. i am very disappointed by the dishonesty displayed by rebel automotive."
25,negative,"called to make an appointment a few weeks ago to get an oil change and a tire rotation and to get my back tire looked at because it was getting low. they call me about and hour later and i asked ""is my car ready"" the guy said well your front two tires are completely worn down and the metal will be shown through at any moment, at this point is it just dangerous to drive on it and we can't rotate them and you also need a transmission flush. my two tires were not worn down that much and i was definitely in no need of a transmission flush. i've had this car for 1 year. they charged me 500 dollars and when i got there i asked to look at my old tires they took off and they said ""oh the guy already came and got them"" which was a lie they don't haul off tires that fast. when i got into my car the low pressure light was still on so i went back in to ask why, and i stood there for about 10 minutes and nobody came so i left and took my car to a discount tire and they said i had a nail in my back tire that i originally went in there for to get checked out. so this place not only ""recommended"" services i didn't need on my car and they also  didn't even solve the problem that i originally went in there for. all they wanted was their money and they were no help at all."
26,negative,"i urge you to stay away from this dealership and do not call without first blocking your phone number!! 
i purchased my vehicle about 9 months ago. i took it in to be serviced a couple weeks after purchasing it so they could do all of their ""to-do"" list promises. a few days after picking up my vehicle, i notice the transmission and oil light had come on, i advised my service guy (rick) who assured me that all of the fluids had been changed and that the lights would turn off. a week later, my engine blew up and had to be completely replaced ($8000). we were told by another certified kia dealership that there was no oil in my engine and there were also no leaks. the service people at pinnacle likely forgot to replace the oil after draining and we had been driving on fumes. thankfully my warranty covered a bulk of the replacement of my new engine but it took nearly 3 months to replace and pinnacle nissan did nothing for us. 

since our purchase, we have received countless telemarketing calls from various sales people at the dealership. we have asked very politely to stop calling us as we will never do business with them again. however, we have continued to receive calls up to 7 times a week. each time, the sales person assures us that our contact info will be removed. it never is. 

i was contacted again last week by payton and explained to her what the situation was and even after that, she still tried to sell me and buy back my vehicle as if she heard absolutely nothing i pleaded with her!! she finally agreed to get in touch with the head of internet sales to remove my contact info completely. 

i received another sales call today.. in shock i demanded  a manager and was passed to a woman named ""meja""... i explained to her how frustrated i was and she was nothing but rude and unprofessional and didn't appear to care at all so i demanded someone above her. i then spoke to jerimiah and again, explained the situation.. he insisted that i keep getting calls because i call in and the number gets put into the database. i told him that wasn't the case because i don't call in, they call me!!! he looked up my number and said that he will take it out of the system. i told him i do not want to have to change my number which ive had for 7+ years but if i get another call, my husband and i are gonna pursue further action and he hung up on me. 

i cannot believe the level of unprofessionalism and down right lies that occur within this dealership.. even for a dealership, im in complete disgust!

save yourselves the time and trouble of doing business with scum."
27,negative,"complete transmission rebuild on 2/6/13 ($2,349.30)
once car was repaired and picked up a green indicator light was blinking when in d5? i called cottman transmission and the manager told me to bring the car back in for him to look at.
took car on 2/24/13 to determine issue- was told by center manager, andy, that according to the ""code"" it needed a new 4th gear pressure switch part. when i asked him why they didn't see that it needed replacing while they were rebuilding transmission, he stated ""it is not covered under your warranty.""
picked up car on 2/26/13 and d5 light still blinking? i called cottman back and again andy asked me to bring the car back in to see what the issue was? i questioned why they had me pick up the car if the indicator light was not fixed, and they test the repairs made? he had no answer.
with no faith at this time, i took car to hendrick acura on 3/16/13 to determine the issue with the blinking light, although i felt it was all related to the recent transmission rebuild. while there, the technician came to find me and laughingly explained that the cottman technician never plugged the new ignition switch into the computer and that is why it was still blinking? 
i left hendrick acura right at closing and after about two minutes the blinking light still occurring, so i called cottman on that monday, 4/15/13, explained what acura told me about them not plugging the new part into the computer? andy said he would need me to again bring the car back to him to determine the issue and next steps.
i called daily to determine status and how long i would need to rent the rental car for. the manager never called to provide an update.
finally on one of the mornings that i called, andy told me that he had spoken to ""rick"" one of the service managers at hendrick acura and that rick told him it most likely needed a new ecu computer and that it was covered under a recent recall and gave me rick's phone number. when i called and spoke with rick at acura, he kindly explained that this was not at all what he told andy, the recall was something completely non related?
when i called andy back with much less patience at this point, he again told me that it needed a new ecu computer and that it would be another $800 to fix it. he said he would reimburse me for the $121 spent on the new switch that was unnecessarily replaced. he also told me that a used ecu computer would be much less expensive and to have honda to install and program it for me cheaper, but not to tell anyone that i could do it that way? 
when i asked him if i should drive the vehicle during the meantime, he said ""you have driven it this long and nothing has happened, so i think you can go a couple more weeks and be fine.""

i then purchased an ecu computer from toms foreign auto parts on ebay on 4/22/13. they sent me the part. 
i took the computer and my car to honda priority in huntersville on 5/1/13 to get the computer put in and programmed, as andy suggested, and it was informed it was the wrong computer (my mistake). jason gardner at honda asked me why i was replacing it anyway, because the one in the vehicle was a good computer. i explained the entire process to date to him.
i returned that part to tom's and ordered the correct ecu computer from ebay that day ($109).
*on 5/6/13 on the way to work, my car broke down on the side of i-85. i had it towed to honda priority and was told it had a hole in radiator and the engine was burned up. now not sure if any of this is related to the blinking light, the ""bad computer"" the new gear switch not being plugged in, i was distraught.
*i had the new ecu computer put in while at honda huntersville on 5/13 for $220, still going on what andy told me the issue of the blinking light was from. 
*i had the engine repaired at cabarrus import services and picked up on 5/17/13. the manager scott reed told me that the car was running well but that the blinking light was on in d5? i explained what i had been through and told him that i had recently had the transmission replaced. he immediately questioned that and told me that the original transmission casing had not been ""cracked."" when i asked him what i should do, he suggested i call an attorney if cottman did not fix it.
so at this point, i have paid for a total transmission rebuild ($2,349) repaired the switch andy told me i needed- $121.50, i replaced the ecu computer $329 (part and labor) andy told me i needed, meanwhile the engine burned because no indicator lights told me there was an issue with radiator-so it was replaced ($3,311.56), and now the blinking light that started after the transmission was rebuilt at cottman is still occurring? 
i called cott"
28,negative,"let me preface this review by saying that it is replacing a 5-star review.

i've been using usa auto service for about 3 years.  i happened on them when they were just around the corner from my house.  i've spent thousands with them.  including a rebuilt transmission.

my car's engine light came on one afternoon.  the car even shut itself off a couple of times.  i promptly took it to usa auto service where i have traditionally dealt with dave, who is the reason i continued to go there, despite having moved 30 minutes across town last summer.  he wasn't there during this entire experience.

i dropped the vehicle off on thursday, june 28th.  the manager told me that 2 parts needed to be replaced and that it'd be about $600.  no problem.  several hours later, they called.  they informed me that they'd replaced the parts but now the pcm needed to be replaced.  he had a guy in florida who could get it to him for a good price.  he was going to ""overnight"" the pcm to them straight away.  total cost was around $1700 which he said i would have to pay in full straight away.  he said he'd call me the next day to give me an update.

next day came and went - no call.  and so did the weekend.

i decided to phone them late afternoon on monday, july 2nd.  i spoke with the manager and he told me he would get back to me with a tracking number the next day.  i didn't say anything, but the word ""overnight"" gave me the impression it was going to be a relatively quick turnaround.  and now it sounded like the part probably hadn't even shipped from florida yet after 4 days.

next day came and went with no call.  4th of july, of course, was a wash.  i gave them the benefit of the doubt and left them alone until i hadn't heard anything by saturday - nine days after leaving the car with no updates from them.


on saturday, july 7th, i phoned again for the status. i spoke with a manager who said they'd received a pcm but it didn't work so they had reached out for another one.  this didn't give me a lot of faith in the parts from their ""guy in florida"".  but most importantly, all this has been going on and nobody had the thought to call with an update.  i expressly said to the manager, ""can you please just keep me informed if there are delays or problems?!""  ""sure.""

i was starting to see the mo of this re-imagined version of usa auto service.  i made it a point to keep quiet and let them execute their version of customer service without any interference.

it's now monday, july 16th.  a full nine days more after our last conversation.  i'd like to point out that to this point, they haven't phoned me a single time in close to three weeks (except for the initial problem).  it was that morning that they finally broke streak and phoned to ask for my spare key.  they needed it for the programming of the pcm.  why they didn't ask for it prior to this point, knowing the repair they were performing, i can't really make any sense of.  but it seemed par for the course.  thankfully, i still had my original spare key.  on this trip, i gave them a free oil change card that dave had given me sometime back and asked them to provide it while they were finishing up the repair.

another 4 days later on friday, july 20th, the phone rang at 11:30am with a notification that the car was done and ready to be picked up.  after 22 days.  i went over that afternoon to collect the car.  as i was signing out, i asked if they had performed the oil change as i'd requested.  of course, they hadn't...  so, i waited for the oil change i'd asked for days ago.  

the first thing i saw when i started the car was a tire light appearing and the display said ""tire pressure monitor fault"".  i returned to the manager.  he told me i needed to take it to a tire place and have them reset the sensors in the tires.  something one might mention as you're checking out.

so, i did.  big 10 tires checked all the sensors and connectors.  no problems.  it was the pcm.  as you might have expected.  money down the drain.

back to usa auto service on thursday, august 9th.  where i left the car for another week with no contact.  on wednesday the 15th, i called for an update.  they said they'd called and left a message the day i dropped it off that it was done.  odd thing is, my phone shows no voicemail or missed calls.

so, i got the car back today and things seem fine.  of course, i question if the pcm was repaired properly.  or how long it will function...

in closing, i'd like to express that the expense and time are not the things that bother me in this situation.  fixing your car sucks - no doubt about it.  but it happens from time to time.  and you deal with it.  but i will never be dealing with usa auto service again.  they are completely inept at communicating and have zero sense of what customer service is.  

dave - i hope you've left this place.  you're better than this business"
29,negative,"nick is very friendly.
he fixed my car twice with no issues
the third time, he broke a part of the manifold, when he replaced the flex part of the muffler and told me it was broken before, he splashed fresh green coolant fluid under the radiator when i wasn't looking, showed it to me and told me i need a new radiator urgently, he showed me where it  was supposed to be leaking from.
i didn't see anything, he told me he can't teach me the secret of the trade.
my car uses red coolant fluid and it's radiator is just fine.
i miss my old honest mechanic."
30,negative,"if i could give no stars and still review this place, i would! i drove in yesterday to ask the attendant a legitimate question. he was working with another customer so i stayed back and waited until they finished. he never once made eye contact with me though he knew i was there. when he finished with the other car, i approached him to ask what i needed to know and said: ""may i ask a question?"" he replied ""yes"", still not making eye contact! i said: ""if my check engine light is on"" and i paused for a moment because clearly he was annoyed by me. he said, ""that's not a question"". i replied, ""pardon me?"" he said, ""you said you were going to ask me a question, but that was not a question"" seriously trying to push my buttons! i said ""are you serious? you are really copping that attitude with me?"" all this time he was winding up a hose never even looking at me. i said i wanted to know if my check engine light was on if it would affect my outcome. ""he said ""i'll test it for you and you'll find out""  i replied ""then i'll pay you $28.00 and quite possibly fail? he said ""correct"" i replied back to him that i had read some of his reviews and they were pretty bad, and apparently they were spot on! he couldn't have cared less! i told him i was going to leave him a bad review (which i have never done before without using the business first), he didn't care. i told him he was acting like an  a$$ and he had no business working with people! he then called m the b word and went on his way.
don't waste your time or give this place your business! i doubt he owns it, and clearly whoever does is not interested in customer service. there was a blue motorcycle parked there if you see it or him...keep going!"
31,negative,"brought my vehicle in for check engine light (and when you shut the car off the oil light goes on). had approx. $450 work done on the engine, filters, including oil change,etc. check engine light was off for a day then came back on. i told the manager and he said bring it back in.

he ran some codes and told me it needed more work so i would have to have them do a diagnostic. well, they did a diagnostic already (or should have done the diagnostic) when i brought it in the last time and spent the $450. 

i trusted them and gave them one more chance. this time it was $793 for crankcase, fuel pump filter, etc. 

the next day the check engine light came on and when you shut the car off the oil light comes on. car is still not fixed.

called the manager and he said bring it in again. 

you gotta be kidding me really???  either they don't know how to fix this vehicle or are trying to rob me. i think they don't know what the issue is and are clueless how to fix it. either way, now after almost $1,300, my check engine light/oil light is on and who knows what is wrong with it.

i cannot go back to this shop and now have to find another place.

extremely disappointed and unhappy!!!  i even called corporate and they said ""it's all under warranty"". cookie-cutter answer. no one could help me after being transferred to 3 people. 

in, conclusion, the midas shop should have found all issues the first time, let me know what it all was, and fixed everything. not to mention i am really busy and all of the time spent going back was very inconvenient. 

i wish someone in corporate would contact me and send me to a shop that would fix this free of charge and make this right. if not, i am definitely going to spread the word."
32,negative,"my car had an electrical fire under the hood on thursday 4/17 and i had a rental car the next morning and they had my car delivered to me at work on monday morning!!!!!!  

however, i later needed a transmission. i was without a car for several days due to them not being honest with me and letting me know that they had not called the warranty company to request an inspector to come out and look at the transmission to authorize the work. the reason for this was because they had given my car to another company to install my transmission!!!!!!!!!  

i was told that this company zip zap auto was their sister company, and later found out it wasn't .. when i got the rental car from zip zap auto the car was on ""e"". when i tried to call hamid to ask questions about my car he avoided me and had the gate keeper heather blocking all my calls to him. 

i've never done business with an auto repair shop, who gives your car to another shop to repair and doesn't inform the customer about it or even ask the customer???? what's more, you then try to hide your actions by avoiding the customer calls!!!!!! smdh.

was my car fixed by zip zap auto? yes. 
how do i rate busy buggy? sneaky and deceptive."
33,negative,"do not go to peoria ford!!!

for starters we were there from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm and walked out with nothing. i spoke to someone a week before about going into the dealership and had explained our situation. i was told just to come in and i was for sure to walk out with something. i owned a 2013 ford focus and i was having some troubles with it, ford extended the warranty by 2 years on these vehicles because the transmissions are no good so as soon as my car would not go even though it was on drive and i was hitting the gas pedal and after that would not start for at least 5 minutes i took it into the service department right away. once there i was told it would take at least a week to even diagnose it as the transmission department is so far behind with the same vehicles. i was ok with this as long as they would provide a rental vehicle since i do work mon-frid 8-5 and my focus was my only means of transportation they told me no, they could not provide a rental and i would have to pay for it out of pocket. i spoke with managers and even went as far as calling ford corporation and was told no! i just don't don't understand if they are admitting to the issue the car has they should at least pay for a rental. after that the manager in the service department suggested i traded it in. so after talking to someone and scheduling an appointment i was there on saturday early morning in hopes of not being there too late during the buying process. they had us test drive a couple of cars and then had us test drive a truck for which the sales manager beau said would work out perfect for the type of trade we were making. i drove it around the block and completley fell in love with it as did my husband, after coming back we were told ""sorry but i actually plugged the numbers in and it's not going to work"". why would you have us test drive a vehicle you are not even sure we would qualify for?!?! he had the manager in the new car sales department come over and talk to us and he told us flat out there was absolutley nothing he could do for us, when he didn't even try. after that and after being there for almost 5 hours we were tired and aggravated with the type of customer service we were getting so we just left. i requested to speak with the owner pat hickey several times since all these promises had been made to us but nothing was accomplished and i just got the run around, even when we called back later that day offering a higher payment we were told they would call us back but we never did receive a call back, i think we spoke with 5 different people between saturday and early sunday. after all that hassle and pretty much feeling defeated we ended up going down the street to liberty gmc and even though it was a long process since we were making a difficult trade it was definetley worth the wait. we traded in a car and a truck and walked out with a brand new truck and a used car at a great price!! we could not be happier! i am an avid listener of john jay and rich in the morning and kept hearing what great customer service they offered at peoria ford and i have to say i was very dissapointed, i think they only offer great customer service to customers walking in with ""green cash"" as doug told my husband that is what they were looking for. needless to say after the customer service i received there and ford corporate i will never return there or ever purchase a ford vehicle in my life and will never refer someone to purchase a vehicle from peoria ford."
34,negative,"i took my camaro in today to get the oil change done. everything went smooth until the service was completed and when i got in my car the check engine light was on. i went back inside and spoke to alex who came out to check the code. he told me it was on when he got in and i must have brought it in that way. i told him it was definitely not on and it had to be from them. he was very defensive and insulting and kept insisting it was not their fault. he was not even able to explain the code to me and cleared it and sent me on my way. well 15 minutes later the light is back on so i took it too max automotive, which is a great spot. terry took a look at it and after about 15 minutes explained that the oil filter was improperly installed and had pinched the wiring harness nearby and that was the reason for the code. i was relieved it wasn't a major issue, but angry that cobblestone had done a poor job and tried to blame it on the customer. the management needs to take a closer look at how customers concerns are handled. the poor customer service and poor execution of the job has left a bad taste in my mouth. this is the first and last time i will get an oil change here, and i recommend you look elsewhere before coming here."
35,negative,"i regret few things in my life more than my extremely stupid decision to take my vehicle to sun devil for a transmission rebuild.  they quoted me almost $3,000 with a ""$150 coupon applied"" (what a joke).  i elected to settle up to get my car released to a more honest repair facility, and to add insult to injury, sun devil charged me four hundred fifty dollars to release my vehicle.  they also took several hours to ""clean everything off"" before putting the parts in a box, forcing the successor mechanic's tow truck to have to leave and come back later, further delaying my repairs when it took several business days just to get an outrageous quote from sun devil.  the successor facility is providing a 2 year warranty and repaired my vehicle in less than 1.5 days for about eight hundred dollars less than sun devil quoted me.  i am sick about the $450 i did not have to spend that i paid sun devil to do nothing but deprive me of my vehicle for several days and disrespect my business with an outlandish quote.  save yourself the heart ache and do not give sun devil auto your business."
36,negative,"if i could apply zero stars, i would, because this place is awful.  

i bought my first car ever from lake norman chrysler in 1994, a chrysler concorde.  the dealership was under different ownership back then.  around 150,000 miles, the car had problems, but that's to be expected.  i had the transmission rebuilt, then replaced (they were still making concordes at the time).  i had 8-10 sensors replaced.  i had a new engine put in.  in 2007, i sold the car to a friend, and with minimal maintenance, the car is still on the road today, at 220,000 miles.  no complaints, despite sinking between $12k-$15k into the car for repairs alone.

i bought another chrysler in maryland in 2007, a pacifica.  i returned to the lake norman area in april, 2011.  i decided automatically, based on my prior experience at lncdj, to go back there for service.  big mistake.

the minor stuff- the car wash bends my front license plate every time it gets washed (5x so far).  there is still dirt on my car.  there is no paper floor mat to keep their dirty shoes from transferring dirt to my carpet.

the big stuff- they are sketchy!  i wanted all 4 brake pads and rotors replaced because at the time of my last service, their own serviceman told me they needed to be replaced.  that, and having sold hondas for 3 years in maryland, i know that those items need replacing every 45-55k miles.  i set an appointment several weeks in advance for an 8:00 time slot.  i reminded them what needed to be done, and asked that they call me if anything else needed work.  they said it would take 3-4 hours.  at 12:00, i called to check on my car.  i couldn't reach my service manager until 1:00, despite him not taking a lunch break-  he was just too lazy to return my call.  

then he proceeded to tell me 'we replaced the two front brake pads like you asked.""  wait, hold up!  i asked for all 4, plus all 4 rotors to be replaced, and it has been 5 hours!  he said, ""you only said the front two brakes.""  so, after getting mad and losing my temper on the phone, he said my car also needed new tires (they are 3 months old!!), my transmission fluid replaced (also 3 months old) and my windshield wiper blades replaced (only 2 weeks ago, and at their dealership).  

i ended up getting 4 new brake pads, two front rotors replaced, two rear rotors resurfaced, and the wiper blades replaced again.  free.  i refuse to pay them any more.  and the shuttle didn't arrive to pick me up until 2:00, making this an all-day affair.

the other major issue:  i needed an oil change last week, and i purchased a service package from them that included 3 free oil changes, so i have no choice but to return unless i want to pay full price somewhere else (i'm debating doing just that).  i went back on a friday because i also had received a piece of mail saying i won something, come in to claim my prize.  yadda, yadda.

now, i used to sell cars, mind you.  i know how salespeople are, and i know how a lot of people view them, especially car salespeople.  well, this ""free prize"" apparently included going on a test drive, giving them lots of personal information about your spending habits, budget, and financial information (yearly income, credit, etc.)  i only wanted my stupid free prize, not a new car.  but, going along with it, i gave him my information and then he told me i won a free oil change at their dealership.  woohoo!

he had written all of my personal information on the flyer that had been mailed to me that i had brought in.  i wanted that piece of mail and all the personal information on it back.  keith jones, the salesman, took it and put it behind his back, like a child would do.  ""nah-nah, can't get it!""  i thought he was joking, but he wasn't.  i asked another employee for his name, and not only would they not tell me his name, they said ""you're not going to get that paper back.  it's ours because you gave it to us.""  

so, what do you do when someone steals something of yours?  yes, i called the police.  the dispatcher asked for his name, he said ""guess,"" he argued with me when i described his clothing to the dispatcher.  the dispatcher asked for me to talk to the manager.  salesman takes me to the ""manager"" who laughs and calls me a crazy lady.  the cops showed up, got my piece of mail, and give it back to me.

i got the police report, which had the salesman's name on it, which is the only way i know his name.  i visited their website and discovered the guy i talked to wasn't a manager, and wasn't even pictured on their website (maybe he's new?).  

anyway, lesson learned.  you get what you pay for.  i'm not going back.

don't make my mistake.   this was a 17-year old business relationship they trashed.  

if you know of an alternate chrysler dealership in nc that is more respectful, honest, and timely, please send me a message!  for now, i'm driving all the way to massachusetts for service, as when i lived there i had stellar service at sudbay chrysler in gloucester, ma."
37,negative,"do not bring your car here. i brought my car to bayview moore automotive several times over the past 4 years, because the location was very convenient for me. i have had nothing but problems with this mechanic.

i brought my car in for an oil change and brake light bulb replacement a couple years ago. bma called and told me that i really needed to have my front brake pads replaced/rear brakes serviced and that they didn't recommend leaving it too long. cost me just over $900. looking at the invoice they put a bunch of different ""packages"" together to come up with that price (they replaced and serviced the brakes, did a tire changeover, oil change, new brake light bulb). the brakes now squeak when applying them lightly, ever since they replaced them. i brought the car back twice and asked them to look at it but was told that nothing was wrong and it could just be the type of brake pads.

now in may 2016, i brought my car in for an oil change and transmission flush (based on their recommendation when they did the spring tire changeover). the work was complete at 5:00pm and i picked my car up and drove home (50km to whitby). the next day i found a large oil leak underneath my car. i drove the car back to them on monday morning and asked them to take a look at it, thinking maybe something was just loose after the oil change. they called me a about an hour later and i went over to talk to them. the car was up on the hoist and they pointed out a large crack in my oil pan that they ""noticed"" that day when i brought it in. they had already put some sort of epoxy seal on the crack and said that it should seal it up, and it would be fine. they said if the seal didn't work, i'd have to replace the oil pan, and would cost me about $500-600. i told them that i brought my car in for routine maintenance, and clearly they caused the crack in the oil pan, and they needed to fix it. the service rep talked to the owner and they replaced it for free. i can't prove it, but i have a feeling they cracked it and sealed it up on the friday and sent me home, thinking i wouldn't ever notice.

so last week i was driving on the 401 at a high speed and heard loud grinding noises coming from the engine area. this is about 10 weeks after bayview moore automotive repaired the oil pan. i thought maybe my timing belt had gone, since it was due to be replaced. i had a tow truck tow my car to a different mechanic in the neighbourhood and it wasn't the timing belt. the first thing the new mechanic said was ""have you had any work done on the car recently?"". i told them yes, and that i was recently at another mechanic. the new mechanic said that there was a bracket that attaches to the transmission and blocks out debris, and it was not reattached properly. it came loose and caught when the tires turned and broke off and got all twisted up (they gave me the twisted up part, so i still have it). anyways, the mechanic said that someone didn't put a bolt through the hole on one side of the bracket, and that's how it came loose. he said he doesn't even know why someone would have had to remove that bolt in the first place. i have to wonder if they did it intentionally.

do yourself a favour and bring your car somewhere else."
38,negative,"hey lake norman, you ever heard the phrase ""it's not you, it's me""? well based off of the comments on this page apparently the problem with your dealership is not the customers it is you! i was pleased overall with my interaction at your dealership up until recently and it has definitely gotten worse. today it came to a head. i own a 2014 grand cherokee with 34,000 miles(well under the yearly average since i purchased in july 2013) that i drive to and from the airport and around town. your 4 free oil changes is a joke given the fact i only received 3 because when i reached the point for the 4th you stated it was too late(a month over the 2yr mark). when asked to extend, you simply did not return my message/request. budget for 4 oil changes on every car sold with no time limit, simple. strike one! i went down the street for service in order to go on a trip. then i go in for two recalls and request whatever service is needed to maintain ""tires for life"" and nothing was serviced beyond the recall. strike two! then today, i go to get an overpriced service ($160 to do oil change, rotate tires and replace cabin/air filter- which were filthy but odds are they were filters kept under your counter to show customers to get them to replace) and was updated on what was needed to get my tires for life then was given a quote. i then get a call later informing me i didn't qualify because i was serviced for an oil change down the street and told i didn't service my vehicle to the program standards. changing oil every 7500 miles is the standard and was done!!! the only way you can afford to give ""tires for life"" discount is by gouging customers on your service visits hence why you disqualify a customer if they service elsewhere. your ""tires for life"" manager is a completely useless and horrible customer manager and deserves what he gets when customers choose to shop elsewhere because of him. your ""advertising"" is a shame and your business practices suck. jeep- awesome!!! will continue to be an owner on my next vehicle but will shop elsewhere. the great thing about social media lake norman jeep is that consumers can help each other avoid being manipulated by companies like yours. good day"

i am a female and made clear to paula, the receptionist and her mechanic jessie, that i do know a little about cars and that i have an idea what my issue was. 2 days later, after they said they needed the take out the engine and many expensive work hours later, i got my car back. it worked for about an hour, then the check engine light came on. that day  i received a phone call from paula saying that they forgot to install a part....the missing tube was sent to the shop late, yet they released my car. how does that happen. they really need to communicate with each other!!! no apologies or anything, instead paula told me she could ship it on my cost and charge my credit card.
since i am from out of town, i had my ""professional"" audi mechanic check out the bill and the work they performed on my a4 after my trip....and he was just shaking his head with a deep exhale. first off did they not only break part of a plastic tube, they also charged me double ($30) for coolant. when i picked up the car, i signed the 3 page bill without checking...and i do take full responsibility for that, however non of the mechanics actually came out to explain the work they did.
these guys might just be good enough for an oil change.
with that said....i recommend to everyone to rather get a tow truck than to pull into ted wiens!!!"
40,negative,"screw this place!! my boyfriend and i decided to stay here for the night, we are locals and were just looking for a little staycation.  the hotel was rundown and depressing and the room felt more like a prison cell and of course the hookers. but i kind of expected it for the price we paid. none of that even bothered me. the thing that pissed me off enough to complain on the internet about was in the morning when i got my car from the valet (or better yet didn't get my car) the attendant proceeded to throw my keys at me saying ""your car won't start it just clicks"" as he went on with helping other people who were waiting for their cars. i had to stop him from what he was doing just to find out where exactly it was parked. when i got to my car clearly the battery had died. i then called and asked to talk to the hotel manager. i've never had trouble with the battery just giving out for no reason. my best guess is that when they took the key out try clicked it too far back and the inside lights were left on. when i talked to the manager i might as well have been talking to a computer. he took my info while i was sitting stranded in the valet parking lot. i asked what he could do to help me and he simply said ""i'll have to make some call and do some research"". luckily i had a friend come to my rescue and give me a jump. 5 hours later the manager calls and says sorry i couldn't see your lights on in the camera, nothing we can do for you. not only was i late for work because of this whole debockel my battery died again because it was so drained from whatever they did. the costumer service of this place is appalling. downtown is trying to do a revamp, they should just give up on the old cortez. save yourself a bunch of annoyingness and don't even go in here"
41,negative,"the worst auto repair service i have ever recieved. i took my truck in at the open of business on a saturday morning. needed a heater core, 6 hour job. they did not start it that day, or sunday, or monday. nor did anyone from firestone ever call me, in 4 days. i had to constantly call to check on progress. i was given excuses that it was a big job and they were short handed. monday they began and finished the job, 6 hours later. i picked up my truck, paid $900 and left. 10 miles down the road, my check engine light came on. i took it back the next day and they tried to charge me $99 for the diagnosis!! the problem was, they had forgotten to bleed some line.....etc. be advised before taking your vehicle here. this occured in april, 2018"
42,negative,"quick service replacing the recalled airbag in my cr-v, but when i tried to pick up the car, it had a check engine light and stalled repeatedly in the parking lot. neither had ever been issues prior to dropping it off, but the service department refused to look into it without paying $110 for diagnostics. i spoke to management and they reluctantly agreed to read the check engine light. the results eventually showed the issue to be unrelated to the airbag replacement, but it also revealed their lack of commitment to customer service and their only goal to be taking your money."
43,negative,"2013 brand new sonata - new problem of the month! now the car won't start. the message is ""key not detected"". the key fob is in the freaking car!! wtf is wrong now??? checked the internet - this is a common problem that hyundai is aware of since 2011!!! could be the key fob, could be the brake pad sensor, could be this, could be that...could be hyundai sucks!! do not buy a hyundai, you will be hugely disappointed....maybe this is why the salesman switched out cars at the last minute after my being there over 6 hours!! be sure to read the 38 ""not recommended"" reviews to read the other half of the reviews on yelp!!!"
44,negative,"my husband brought our car into c&r about three weeks ago. we asked for an oil change and mentioned our check engine light had been coming on and also asked for a full inspection. when they called us to tell us what was needed my husband walked over to talk in person since we live super close. we needed a premium oil change because there was oil gunk that needed to be removed, timing belt was going bad, our spark plugs needed changed, new back tires, and we had a cracked radiator. we were told see you monday and our bill would be (gulp) $2000. thankfully i just got a new job that gave me more than 12 hours a week and we just got our taxes too.
anyways monday comes and thankfully i had the day off. i had to call them around 430 because i hadn't heard anything yet. i was told that they received a damaged radiator and had to order a new one, but still hoping they could finish the car by end of business. at 545 i get a call that the courier was stuck in traffic and they wouldn't be able to finish our car until tuesday morning. i was assured this time that part was in good condition and correct....
tuesday: the part isn't in!!? where is this courier coming from? is he still stuck in traffic? or is this actually just a line i was fed? my husband has to go to work and we need our car for him to go! when they finally call they tell him that the part that came in is wrong and the hoses do not match up, but don't worry it's only going to cost you another $200.
so now my husband has to call in since we have no one to take him to work, c&r doesn't offer rentals or to take him to get one, and a bus is out of the question.
wednesday: finally our car is ready! yay! everything looks great, sorry we took so long, and this car will give you at least another 100,000 miles.....
since that day our check engine light has come on again! we called c&r and are told that they have another idea of what the actual issue might ""really be"" and to go ahead and bring it in, not to worry this should only cost $100, or so....
our power steering belt came loose...they did fix that for free (that's the 1 star)
oh and our car died last weekend!
thanks c&r!"
45,negative,"as far as body work goes they did a nice job. however, when a car goes into a repair shop with a check engine light on (which came on as soon as the accident happened) one would think that this same car would leave the shop with the check engine light off. however, this wasn't the case. after expressing my concern about this not being fixed, i was told ""we cleared the code. if it comes back on, we will take it to dealership for testing"". 
i was apprehensive about driving my car after this knowing that something is still wrong from the accident.  i use my car to drive my children around so it's imperative that it was returned to me to be just as safe as it was prior to bringing it in to the shop. 
a day and a half later, the light came back. after giving it some time to see if it would go away on it's own, i returned to tallmadge collision to reiterate that i do not feel safe in the car they returned to me. 
their advice ""you'll have to call your insurance about it."" 

if the car would've been repaired correctly, i would not have to ""call my insurance"" about it. 
 
my family and i have had body work done on numerous vehicles here over the years. i can say with 110% confidence that i will not be using tallmadge collision for any future repairs."
46,negative,"this business employs subpar specialists and runs a neglectful auto repair shop rooted in deceit. unfortunately, busy buggy or busy boots has yet to learn the art of creating loyal customers through integrity and loyalty. this is a hard blow for me since i frequent small mom & pop businesses as a way of giving back to my community instead of the huge conglomerates. 

i am the owner of the toyota brought into b.buggy on 6/22 with gregg (the review below mine). i personally didn't originally leave a review because my best friend gregg did. additionally, i was trying not to ding this business with another 1-star review for the same service experience. unfortunately, the store manager hamid has been instigating another review - specifically from me - by manipulating the validity of gregg's review by calling in to question his identity even though hamid has already been provided sufficient proof to support our claim and idenities.

background: i brought my vehicle in for service the day after replacing my car battery when it died during a short stop at a convenience store. my car insurance paid for roadside service to get my car back on the road when it wouldn't start. i assumed the root case was the battery, so i went to reilly's and had my battery tested. they determined that my battery needed to be replaced. i bought a new battery and went about the rest of my day (see exhibit 1). only i was now hearing some strange noises coming from under my hood. i had an intuition that the battery may not have been the root cause but the end result of a bigger problem with my car.  the next day, and two days before we would embark on a 2800 miles cross country move, we visited b.buggy's for a pre-trip inspection. i was super clear with them about the details of what recently happened with my car, the recent noises, and the fact that my car would be making a long trip during record heat (see exhibit 2).

during the service, b.buggy was also extremely clear about what they checked and what they recommended for service/repair. this included everything from an upper engine torque mount, license plate light bulb, wiper blames, air filter, and engine air filter to simply letting me know in what they called a ""vehicle memo"" that my transmission fluid was over filled. had they merely checked the voltage of my alternator as hamid claimed met ""specs,"" (see exhibit 4) i guarantee you that notation would have been included among the many other notes and suggestions on my estimate (see exhibit 2 & 3). the truth is, they didn't really check my alternator, but hamid is now posing as a post-diagnostician as he now attempts to sway the public into believing that it ""appears"" that my situation was the alternator brushes which he claims is too costly to fix and not practical to even mention before a 2800 mile trip (exhibit 5)  however, he claims my alternator was tested and yet his shop omitted this one important ""vehicle memo"" that could validate his statement.

when my car wouldn't start the morning of our road trip while at a gas station 20-minutes out of las vegas, i immediately got my car to the nearest toyota dealership. service confirmed my alternator was faulty and not charging (exhibit 6). i am truly thankful that this situation happened within the city limits because the alternatives could have been scary, e.g., stuck in the texas panhandle during record-breaking heat waves and intermittent cell service. yicks! 

hamid's manner of handling this complaint was troubling - although not initially. he sent a private yelp message to gregg (exhibit 4). after a couple email exchanges, he asked for invoice proof (sent to busyboots@outlook.com) in exchange for a fair reimbursement to offset ""the cost associated with the repair not being caught while in our shop"" (exhibit 7). at first, hamid seemed genuinely concerned about his business and making things right to earn our business and respect in spite of various excuses and an obvious lie in his exchange. however, once we furnished the proof, hamid posted a superficial yelp comment questioning who gregg was, his name not matching the vehicle description, and of course stating that ""quite a bit of my earnings taking care of unhappy motorists... to avoid ill feelings towards me and my business"" (see exhibit 5). hmm. why does he spend a lot of money on ill feelings toward him and his business? do his customers value his service? hamid then posted an update on 8/25 (exhibit 8), which ultimately prompted this reply. 

although hamid was never asked to make restitution, he did volunteer to do so. however, hamid actions when confronted with the truth were less than honorable and down right deceitful."
47,negative,"i've been bringing my truck here for more than a year for my oil changes. i've always paid for the full service oil change just to make sure all my fluids are topped up.
well i took my truck here for its latest oil change and left it to run accross to the shipping center accross thomas.
i guess i should have stayed.. like i usually do..
here it is not quite two weeks later and my truck started making unusual noises..
come to find out my oil filter has not been changed, i'm down more than 2 quarts of oil, my radiator is empty and my transmission fluid is gunky.

suffice it to say i will not be coming back and i will be looking into filing a complaint with the bbb.

so my advice is that if you want to bring your vehicle here, make sure you stay and watch what they do to your automobile.

as for me, i'm looking at having to have my engine completely cleaned of burnt oil and transmission fluid and hope i won't have to get a new transmission or engine."
48,negative,"worst worst experience!!

i came in to change my oil, then they told me i need to change all of my brakes ($300). 

after i changed my breaks, the back of my vehicle starts to make noises (i.e. flapping noise and squeaking noise).  i came in a few days later to ask the reason, they told me that it was something wrong with the new brake pads alignment.  so they fixed it. but no, the noise is still there. i went back again, the next day. they told me it was not about the brake alignment,  it is about the transmission, and engine mounts (another $700)!  

if it is not anything about my brake pads alignment and it is about my mounts, why don't they tell me at the first time went back?  how does mounts issue cause noises from the back of my vehicle?  no one explained the reason detailed for me."
49,negative,"car wash cleveland left my car inoperable due to the water damage they caused to the hybrid computer system that controls my car. after i got home, i was unable to drive my car anywhere, let alone back to car wash cleveland the next day. i had to get my car towed to the dealership to be fixed that night because i needed to have a functioning car. i was in the middle of a move and needed to be out of my apartment on dec. 1st and was unable to do this without a car. diego suggesting that i should have waited until the next day to have a functioning car is absurd. getting a car detail does not mean receiving a car back that is inoperable. the toyota certified technicians also confirmed that the check engine light being on after a detail is not normal, it is dangerous because water is inside the electrical computer system of the car. if turning on the heat would have ""dried out"" my car as diego suggested, my car would not have quit functioning. the issue was not only that my check engine light was on and my car was sluggish after i left the detail shop, it was that my car would not drive after i got home. the dealership did not ""blow out"" my car as diego suggested. expert technicians ran diagnostic tests on the hybrid computer system, then took it apart, dried it out, put the computer system back together and ran diagnostic tests again to make sure it was functioning properly. only technicians that are certified in this computer system are able to properly fix the problem. a car detail shop, that was not even aware of my car having a computer system, is not the appropriate party to intrust with fixing it. 
when i picked up my car at 5:10pm on 11/30/16 from car wash cleveland, i tipped diego before driving my car and realizing that is was damaged. as soon as i drove out of the parking lot and became aware of the problem i informed diego of the issue. this was about 5:15pm, not 7pm as diego states, and i have copies of the phone logs documenting when this conversation occurred. when he informed me that the issue was ""normal"" and to dry out my car, i agreed because i had not yet spoken to the toyota dealership to find out that it is not normal and good be dangerous. it was also before my car would not shift into drive. as soon as my car became inoperable, i called car wash cleveland multiple times but it was after their business hours. getting my car functioning asap was a priority for me since i needed it to move. i did not have the luxury of waiting to see if car wash cleveland could fix it themselves. bottom line is, if you are a professional company and you damage someones property during a service, you must take responsibility for it instead of trying to blame the client for how they handled the situation after you damaged their car. it is also very unprofessional to promise that you will file an insurance claim and then fail to do so. there is a good likelihood that car wash cleveland is not insured since they will not provide me with their insurance information. i have reported them to the bbb and asked them to please investigate this business for proper licensing and insurance."
50,negative,"i will never take my vehicle there again for service and i would highly recommend you go elsewhere. i took my car to them to address a check engine light that had come on indicating an issue with my evap system. every single time i got the car back (i visited about 6 times, so many times i lost count) the light would come back on with the same code. i would then try to schedule another appointment to address and fix it properly and either not hear back about trying to schedule the appointment or what was going on. they should have prioritized my service experience given their failure to address and fix the problem the first, second, third, forth etc. time but i was consistently treated poorly. they comped the work done (due to their failure in fixing the issue) then called me the night before my next appointment (again, for the same issue) to accuse me of not paying for all the ""work"" they've done on my car when it was their inability to properly service the vehicle all along making them lose money on the repair. i took the car in to pay to fix the problem, not to waste my time, theirs, and get free shit. do not take your vehicle there."
51,negative,"took my 2013 st in for a new battery got a call couple hours later they suggested to replace my negative battery cable with sensor. ok i didn't plan on walking out spending $300 to replace a battery and cable but it is what it is. driving my car home getting off freeway and my car will not shift out of second i limp home call berge ford tell them the issue and asked if it had anything to do with the battery replacement nope shouldn't have anything to do with it they said. ok now i call my extended warranty people who can't pick the car up until the next day, they tow it to their shop and trouble shoot the issue. seem as though when they changed the battery out they broke a tab on the lower air box and then instead of replacing the damage they did they decided to glue the tab on.. guess what the tab blew off on the way home and got stuck in the transmission linkage. so berge now sends a tow truck to the warranty company to pick it up and repair it. they did replace the lower air box at no charge and got the tab out of the linkage. i was offered an apology and that was it. i'm in the service industry you did the bare minimum to cover your mistake. what about my time and being without my vehicle for two days? just because you can repair it in one day does not mean i can drop what i'm doing in my life to come and pick my car up on your schedule. it was extremely inconvenient to me and something that i felt was not taken into consideration when i came to pick it up the second time."
52,negative,"last month my wife took in her car because of an oil leak. they did some engine modification and up-sold us on some ac line replacements. when she got her car back it still had an oil leak and her ac would only blow hot air. the mechanic stripped her oil drain plug and there was still problems with the ac lines.

last week i took my car in for a check engine light. they tried to up-sell $400 for an oil pressure switch, belt and air filter housing. the belt is in good shape and the air filter housing is a missing a screw. spoke to another fletchers, midas and gm dealership about air filter housing replacement. all of them agree that there is no reason to replace the housing. 

this location is horrible, go to the 35th ave and union hills location or find another repair shop."
53,negative,"i wish you could give this place no stars.  do yourself a favor and don't buy a car from here.  i hate typing and never leave reviews, but this place is ridiculous.  i have boughten two yukon denali's from here.  one was 2yrs old $33k and one brand new $60k and i will never buy from here again in my life.  i have had to use the service department on seven different occasions and almost none of my experiences went well.  you pull in with an appointment and half the time it takes 5 min to get greeted even though they are all just sitting there pretending to work on their computers.  it takes a minimum all day to get your truck back half of the time they don't even diagnose the problem for 6 or 7 hrs.  i had horrible experiences the 2nd and 3rd time that  i can't even remember most recently they failed to call the car rental company and get that reimbursed for us they forget about you and i have had to call in several times a day each time to stay on them to get things done.  i tried to take it to firestone in anthem which has great customer service and gets things done quickly, but i found out gm is making it almost impossible for any other place but the dealership to work on it and it won't let their computers diagnose the problems for transmissions and they are working on making that for everything.  so if you buy from there you are going to be stuck getting it serviced there.  they have a shuttle that is nice they will take you wherever you want to go and come back and pick you up so that is nice because you need it for the all day ordeals and seven hour oil changes.  the one service guy rannell somewhat at least try's to make up for his mistakes i will give him credit for that.  the service was so bad my wife called gmc corporate to complain and then he got things taken care of.  we asked to speak with the manager on 3 separate occasions and he isn't working half of the time and has never returned a call to date.  of course since they are basically a government agency the service is horrible it is probably impossible to get fired there from what i have seen.  the difference between going to firestone in henderson and this place is remarkable.  firestone has super friendly professional people they handle things quickly and get them done while gm just seems like they don't care and they have you by the balls because you can't take it anywhere else.  i am selling my denali as quickly as possible to get an escalade which pisses me off gm still gets my money but i will be cadillacs service is much better.  i am only sticking with gm simply for the fact that rannell guy owns up to his mistakes and fixes them.  i can't get to mad if someone admits they screwed up and fixes it, but overall that place is ridiculous especially to have a manager not call back or to be present from a customer that buys brand new the most expensive cars they have that costs more than some houses you would expect a little better service.  i think this is the first review i have ever done thats how much i dislike this place and not just on one experience, but 7 and what the hell kind of brand new car breaks down 5 times.  the warranty is great though and pays for everything so if you do buy make sure and buy the warranty."
54,negative,"we took my vw bug here to get fixed, and i was told i needed a new mass air flow sensor. we took the car here 3 times, and each time they claimed it was fixed, but the check engine light kept coming on. we took the car somewhere else, and they told us we needed a mass air flow sensor made specifically for a vw. meineke completely disagreed with that, and continued to put in random mass air flow sensors not for a vw. when i demanded they put a vw part in, they specifically told me ""fine, if you want us to put a part in with the words volkswagon on it, we can but it won't help."" i then demanded a refund. i was told my car was word for word ""a pain in the butt"" to work on. everyone i ever spoke to was extremely rude to me. working on my car was obviously a hassle for someone who's job is to work on cars. even after i asked for a refund, my dad had to call and then walk in in order to get the refund. i eventually got the refund and took my car elsewhere. as soon as i got a vw mass air flow sensor put in, my car was fixed. never go to meineke unless you want to have someone roll their eyes at you."
55,negative,"i had a 2014 fiat 500l that i purchased from findlay brand new.  unfortunately, at 11,000 miles the transmission went out.  i took it to towbin for service since they are closer to me.  24 days in service and a new transmission.  i had the thought of trading it in on a new 500l with the different transmission.  i owned 3 fiats at the time, 2 500s and the 500l.  
after looking at the 500l vs the 500x, i decided on the l since it is definitely more bang for the buck.  i admit that i got a very good trade in value on my 2014 500l considering noone wants these vehicles.  alonzo was very good and seemed straight forward which i appreciated.  chris was actually my sales person and a huge disappointment.  my 2014 500l had the navagation system, backup cameras, fully loaded.  you could talk to the system.  the 2015 did not have the nav or backup camera, which i could live without.  however it was vital to have all the other features to me.. text messaging, streaming, song identification, etc which this vehicle does not have.  chris informed me that i must have the wrong type of phone.  i did not change anything.  
after a call to fiat i learned the truth.  chris' response was ""my 500x has all those features...""..  incidentally chris does not return calls or texts.  i even texted him the screen to show that there is no identification of music.. very disappointed...
at the same time, on the same day i bought the 500l, i also traded in my 500 on a 2014 kia soul from the vw dealership.  they brought it over and fiat sold it to me.. that vehicle is phenomenal.  it is 100x better than the 500l.
so today, i texted alonso to tell him that i was not exactly happy and i was going to do some reviews.  he sounded like he was going to help.  he said that he would talk to chris.  i told him my story on how i love the soul and i am going to get rid of the 500l.  he texted me back saying ""let me know if i can help""..... crickets... crickets...   they have 2 kia souls on their lot.  i've had the 2015 500l and the soul for about 2 months... i've put 3500 miles on the soul and 250 on the 500l   tell me which one i like better now...."
56,negative,"this review is speaking to the service department.  

the service was horrible.  i was given don as a service representative.  don acted like he was interested in my vehicle but i found out he was simply trying to swindle me into more service.  i took my trailblazer in for an oil change when i first moved to vegas because i did not know what auto shops to trust.  don recommend i flush all my fluids as my vehicle had 70k miles on it.  so had the money so i paid to flush my transmission, brake, drive train, etc etc fluids.  a year later my check engine light was on so i took it back to findlay to fix the issue so i could pass the smog check to register my car.  good ol don tells me that my transmission and brake fluids looked dirty and needed a flush.  i had just flushed them a year before!! recently i needed a new battery, and instead of spending a half day figuring it out myself, i decided to take it to findlay.  the service operator quoted me $50 labor to replace the battery.  good ol don again charged me $80/hr aaand told me my fluids looked dirty and needed flushing again!!! this guy paid no attention to my vehicle files, tried to swindle me into flushing my fluids multiple times, charged me more labor than i was quoted, and to top it all off while i was waiting he dumped me off with a sales rep, so i had to hear a whole sales pitch.  i am currently a student with debt and no income and a paid off vehicle, so i why would i want to buy a car? i wouldn't. again don did not listen to a word i said."
57,negative,"terrible place! run by crooks! stay away!

this is essentially an epic fail blog, so the key points first:
- bait-and-switch pricing
- reserved car not available - downgraded
- cars in non-road-worthy condition
- cleaning fee extortion only circumvented by bribing mechanic/cleaner

we came into vegas with a plan to do two days of off-roading in the death valley area, four jeeps in total. we reserved the jeeps, got a price quote (over the phone mind you, not written) for the rental of four off-road ready jeeps. we mention multiple times that we would be taking these jeeps off-road, checking to make sure that we can buy sufficient insurance coverage for the drivers who do not have it through their auto insurance. we show up, and low-and-behold, they only have two off-road ready jeeps, another being a stock vehicle with no lift and rock-crawling tires. a long wait ensues until that third jeep is made ready. yay. the fourth one is sourced from death valley.

then comes the bait-and-switch; the clerk behind the counter tells us that ""oh, since you'll be taking these jeeps off-road, there is an $80 surcharge per day to the price that we quoted you."" completely ridiculous, classic bait-and-switch! we told them from the beginning that we were going off road. after arguing for an extended period of time, and letting them know that what they're doing is really not cool (and illegal, for that matter), they reduce their surcharge, but do not void it altogether. well, we were in a holdup position and had to get out of there if we were to make our planned arrival in death valley.

once we were on the road, the check engine light comes on in two jeeps. mine also shows ""change oil"" every time i start it. great. just what you want to drive into the desert. once on the highway, we find that all of the soft tops have essentially disintegrated. they no longer clip into the body properly, and half of the zippers break once they're hit by the road wind. we have to repack the cars to make sure that we don't shed any equipment onto the highway or possibly strike a motorist or biker. in the end, we have to pull all of the soft windows out so that they don't flap violently and hit the backseat passengers in the face.

we go into death valley, run about 60 miles off-road, have fun anyway, and bring the jeeps back on time on sunday. we drive into the lot, and the clerk (a different guy) tells us ""the way those jeeps look, we will have to detail them and charge you for the cost of cleaning. they are disproportionately dirty. "" i ask how much it will cost, and he tells me ""up to $350, but i won't know until we're done."" we paid a dubious off-road surcharge, and now they want to ding us again! are the jeeps dusty? of course they are! they were in the desert...off road. could we do anything about it? no! we couldn't even put in the windows of the soft top since they were broken.

in the end, we just pay off the lot tech with $20 each so that he gives the office his ""seal of approval"". at that point, we just wanted to get out of there with as little further financial damage as possible. what a miserable place. on the way to our hotel, we at least heard that the owner of the company likes to take his cars out into the desert, get drunk, and then drive around in donuts. quality bunch.

my advice: never do business with these people!

note: u save car rentals and dream car rentals are the same business."
58,negative,service department is as much of a scam as anywhere else. brought my truck in for a check engine light and they tried roping me into over 10k in repairs. f that! i'll drive the 4 days back to my home and get the repairs done.
59,negative,"took my car here when my automatic transmission was having trouble getting into gear. they told me that the radiator had broken and had leaked fluid into the transmission, which meant i needed a complete overhaul of the transmission. they estimated the cost to be around $3500! i'll admit, i don't know cars as well as i would like to, but this diagnosis just didn't make sense to me. i took it to a private repair shop for a second opinion. not only was his opinion different, he told me that cottman's had fabricated the entire story. the radiator was fine, it wasn't leaking at all. there was no coolant or any other damage to the transmission. the transmission fluid was dirty, but a simple flush at the second repair shop took care of that. my car is running great now, and it cost me $160 not $3500. save yourself the hassle and stress and don't go to cottman's in the first place."
0,positive,"grant his crew have been amazing. had a few different repairs done there and very happy. got a used car that knew needed work. took it to bmw and they quoted me $2700 for the cooling system. munich did a full repair on that, plus a valve cover gasket plus fixed another leak and found that my check engine light was bc a bad air/fuel mixture and the total repair was less than one at bmw. then had my shift mechanism go out after i picked it up from those repairs and was like ""this is weird"". talked to grant and he said there wasn't a direct connection to their work as they were in a different part of the car but was willing to fix it at cost using a used part with a warrantee and it runs great. 

had them do a little more like a battery and stuff and they will defiantly be my shop of choice. having a german car isn't cheap but finding someone in the battle with you is key!"
309,positive,"my engine light was on in my car and someone told me it was my transmission. i looked aamco up on line and even though it was a saturday and they were closed. they let me bring my car in to check it .he told me what was wrong and when i asked if he could do it for me today he did without hesitation!!! they saved me from having to call off work for 2 days!!! very friendly!!! will definitely go to them for any more work for my car and ask for jim to do the work!!! kudos to you jim, april, and aamco!!!! def 5 stars!!! joann"
310,positive,my elantra had lots of needed work and i chose royalty. had taken my cars there for other minor work and was happy with the service and prices. this time around i needed timing chain water pump and several seals replaced on motor and transmission. after talking to armondo we nailed down a great price to have all the work completed. that price exceeded a savings of over 20% versus other estimates. my car is now running fine without issues. beats buying a new car. see you soon with my van.
311,positive,"first of all i wanted to thank leo for the respect and service he provided for me and my girlfriend. 

i would highly recommend all my friends, family and anyone who are traveling to vegas with car problems to leo. he was honest, fair, and communicated with us the entire time. here is why:

we came in with something wrong with our transmission, it made funny sounds when we accelerated, buckled when we shifted and our check engine light came on. 

we pulled into this lot full of different types of shops. no one had time for us that day and one shop had real bad reviews. 

 we were greeted by leo the manager himself. he listened to our situation and told us what he can do for us. leo said he would try his best to get us back on the road. 

he gave us an estimated quote and said that it would go towards the total cost of the repairs if it came to it. he mentioned that one person was ahead of us and we would be next. keeping us in the loop. 

leo also said he would make sure we would know what was going on before doing anything and would want our permission first.

as we waited, leo offered us sodas, electric outlets, and turned on amazon video while we waited. the bathroom and waiting room was clean. leo refilled the water dispenser with bottled water.  

leo would actually come close, literally sit down on a chair next to us and take the time to listen to us whenever we were making conversation. he always made eye contact with us and informed and explained everything to us about everything. 

we waited for a little over a hour and leo and his team fixed our problem to where we were able to get back on the road. 

we paid in cash and leo gave us a receipt. he even wrote down the computer codes that the car gave for our information to keep. leo never kept anything to himself and communicated everything with us. ""a honest man has nothing to hide or be afraid of.""

his main mission was to get us back on the road and he did. the check engine light was still on but we did not have trouble with the transmission accelerating anymore. no buckling, sounds, or trouble. we could finally go back home!

luckily our car was covered by warranty and leo highly suggested we took it back to our dealership. he did not over charge us nor pushed us for more repairs. we could not take it to our dealership due to our time constraint, location from the nearest dealer, and us being tourist. 

thank you leo and his team at auto xperts."
312,positive,"the only reason i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the poor condition of the vehicle we rented. we had some mechanical problems on the road and the car itself was old and run down. however, they were great at taking care of us, making everything as easy and smooth as possible in getting the car repaired (they arranged everything, told us where to go, and paid for it over the phone). even the repair shops mentioned how easy they were to work with.
and once we returned they refunded us a nice chunk of our rental fee, for the days lost and general inconvenience. 
we will definitely rent from them again, especially knowing that the model that gave us trouble is being phased out. 
great concept and nice people. these vans make road tripping so easy."
313,positive,"service department:

i took my car in because the transmission had been slipping in lower gears and i was getting several warning lights on my dashboard.  most mechanics in the area refused to even look at it, save for the overpriced transmission shops. i was a little wary of taking it to the dealership because they are known for higher labor rates and i didn't want to be solicited by salespeople.

i was pleasantly surprised.  not only was my transmission issue a cheap fix, but they also noticed a leak in my power steering pump (once again, i was wary at first but they turned out to be right about that, too).

elisha was extremely helpful.  i dropped off my car on a friday morning and asked if i could receive updates during the repair.  i let elisha know that my job is mostly over the phone, so we may have to play phone tag, but she was more than happy to text me the updates.  she also arranged a loaner car that i could drive over the weekend (which was an extremely nice late model honda crv).

all in all, it was more expensive than going to a typical auto shop; but the warranties, as well as the convenience, the welcoming atmosphere and the friendliness of all employees was well worth it.

i would consider it a great experience."
314,positive,"i have been to many many unreliable car shops in the valley and after the reviews and how close crawfords was to my house i thought i would try it out. i was having problems with my transmission slipping for almost a year. it was not  super noticeable to everyone, but growing up with a father who restored cars and would have me help with with transmissions i knew there was a problem. i would have shop after shop turn me away and say ""we only notice it a little"" or ""i wouldn't worry about it"". i was shocked! my transmission fluid was burnt and i was determined to get to the bottom of this. i had a warranty that other shops said wasn't good anymore...i couldn't read the paper work well and i trusted them. i was about to trade my car in and spent weekend after weekend at dealers. something wasn't sitting right with me, so i took it here. i told them i had a warranty but wasn't sure on the status. after they did some work they called to tell me the warranty was still good! i did need a new transmission and i needed my drive train replaced. they worked with the warranty company and got me a brand spanking new acura transmission and the warranty paid for it. i was relieved and knew that i did the right thing by taking it here for one last opinion. it ended up costing about $7,300 something. i would most definitely recommend this shop and will be taking my baby here from now on."
315,positive,"great place to great your car or truck worked on. 

i was referred to ventrice by a friend that has been taking his lexus there for years. rocky and his son greg are outstanding. they specialize in volkswagens and audis. 

ventrice also specializes in diesel engines, transmissions, electronics, bottom and top end engine work as well as drivetrains with vw factory certified training and knowledge. 

in addition to their foreign expertise, ventrice also services domestic models as well, and is a licensed pennsylvania inspection station. they even do collision and body work. 

my car needed a complete suspension over haul to pass pa inspection. (springs, upper control arms, ball joints, outer tie rods, front and rear rotors and a front and rear alignment. greg got all of that done in less than a week! 

if you are looking for reliable, friendly, and personal service ventrice auto is your shop."
316,positive,took my car transmission rebuilt got it back in two days  very satisfied with the work and did everything they said they would do will return for any future work thanks
317,positive,"i won't ever take my car anywhere else. ever since my previous repair shop shut down i asked around with my friends and they mentioned this place. they are extremely fairly priced and won't nickel and dime you for everything. they are also the kind of shop that will tell you if something needs to be replaced that's easy (i.e. air filters) instead of trying to get you to pay a premium for them to do it. extremely honest shop and great work done! i've gotten my transmission fluid changed, oil changed and tires rotated multiple times and the prices are great. i've also gotten my blinker bulbs replaced twice and this shop was kind enough to do it for free both times, not often that you find a shop honest enough to do that! this is truly the place to go!!"
318,positive,"have gone here a few times for an oil change, today went for an oil change and a transmission fluid change.  the guys working here seem to truly enjoy their work, could hear them joking around quite a  bit, which is cool with me as long as they get the job done.  which they did.  i think happy employees are a good thing!  they got me in and out in about 45 minutes.  i expected to be there an hour.  so that's another bonus.

the prices are a bit highish, but i know that those prices are set by corporate and they have no control over that....so it is what it is."
319,positive,"excellent service! this team is amazing. i recently had an oil change completed and am very satisfied. have done a few mods (apr stage 1, transmission, and cold air intake) for my gti and trust this team with all my needs.  looking forward to more and will always bring my gti here for mods and oil changes."
320,positive,when my new car needed a new bumper this place was recommended by avondal toyota. they replaced my bumper and soon after i was in a rear end collision which brought me back to have my car repaired. the quality of work is excellent and they stand begins their work. another incident happened when i was caught in a dust storm and my car was damaged so i took it back for the paint and repairs. i have become a frequent customer and truly do appreciate all the hard work and excellent customer service. one benefit of using this body shop is they have rental cars so you don't have to deal with another vendor to rent a car while your car is being repaired. i highly recommend this place for any body work or paint job you need for your vehicle.
321,positive,"best muffler shop i've ever been to. fast, efficient, great price. my 1967 mustang turned out perfectly. would highly recommend"
322,positive,"i'm completely shocked and amazed at the level of service that i just received at this repair shop. our 04 jeep wrangler out of no where was making a lot of clanking noises and was looking what looked like to be oil or possibly transmission fluid. i'm not car saavy whatsoever so i really am at the mercy of mechanic shops when it comes to the recommendations and repairs of my car. i had to have the vehicle to one auto shop in town (sun auto off of stephanie street in henderson) upon arriving i waited almost five hours and had to call them to find out what was going on with my jeep. at first estimate the mechanic vince stated that my jeep was going to need completely new brakes/rotors in the front, knuckle that holds the steering column, and a brake fluid flush. i requested to not get a flush as i heard that type of thing is completely unnecessary. he didn't like to hear that i didn't want that service and proceeded to tell me that the entire cost of the repair was going to be $667. i couldn't believe that price as i have had bad experiences at other sun auto locations. i reached out to my dad who recommended bob and dale over at specialized auto care. he mentioned that when every other shop was giving him the run around and trying to overcharge that they would always give him a straight answer with what was going on with his vehicle. i then had my car towed over to this shop and the tow truck company was over an hour late. dale stayed an hour and 15 minutes after closing to receive my vehicle, mind you, it was the one rainy day in vegas. lol 
the next morning at 10 am dale gave me a ring and let me know that there were a few bolts that had been stripped and they replaced those with one other part. he let me know the noise was gone and everything was working great! magically, the jeep was fixed and not for $667... but it only cost less than $200!! i'm still taken aback from the amount of great customer service i have received from specialized auto care (specifically dale) and am so thankful to not have to spend any more money on a car that we have spent thousands on already. dale, thank you! you have a longtime customer in me!"
323,positive,"mark, dale and the entire crew at ads are true professionals. ads is not the least expensive, in fact, i went to another shop first and had a bad experience (after interviewing multiple shops). gregs japanese auto (stay away) came highly recommended, after leaving a differential plug loose (leaked fluid all over my garage) and not putting the oil cap back on (luckily, found it after i saw the gear oil on the floor) and drilling a hole in the fuel filter hose (ads discovered this), i decided not to go back. 
thus, began my experience with ads. (found them on the internet, read good reviews.)
i purchased a used 'seahawk blue!' 2002 jeep wrangler sport in 2011 because i do not like the crappy new jk (dodge - blah!) engines and wanted to build up a trail rig for arizona, to my specifications...
work to date ads has performed:
- replaced clutch kit. (throwout bearing, pilot bearing, resurfaced flywheel.)
- re geared from 3:73 to 4:88 to accommodate 35"" tires. (a major job, no problems - runs great now. mechanic told me i could 'do wheelies' now. lol.)
- welded in a new flowmaster superflow delta 40 muffler. (talked me out of wasting money on a catback system/new catalytic converter. thank you, actually sounds like a v8 and gets better pick up.)
- added an electronic locker to the rear dana 44. recommended not adding to the front 35s, added limited slip instead. (yeah, easy button for tough hills/ruts/rocks!)
- diagnosed and replaced leak detection pump. (check engine light wouldn't turn off.)
- installed aftermarket beefed up (rubicon express) upper control arms, adjusted lower control arms and added upper ball joints to adjust camber for alignment.
- fixed towing electronics greg's jacked up.
- installed speedometer calibrator.
- replaced fuel filter hose. (greg's drilled a hole into it when doing shoddy work prior.)
- replaced rear main seal and rear pinion seal.
- replaced oil pan gasket. 
- replaced serpentine belt.
while the jeep's transformation is nearly complete. (adding body armor, new wheels/tires, lowering body lift...) my jeep will only go to ads from now on.
i also recommended a good friend and they fixed up his infinity g20 - he loved the work.
again, you can probably skimp and pinch pennies and go to another shop, like i did initially. but you could pay for it in shoddy labor, lack confidence on quality of work and if you are doing major upgrades/projects like re gearing and clutch work, consider ads. i often take my jeep off road, i do not want to have to worry about breaking down because of crappy work.
i recommend ads to all my friends, i have no affiliation with them - but have gotten to know some of the guys over the last couple years and highly recommend them. they are very knowledgeable and spent extra time going over some of my detailed questions...
i know a lot about my jeep, and double check any recommendations.(paranoid) in fact, the previous owner left behind paperwork i keep in a file at my house. a couple items were pointed out to her previously and there was a quote - the ads mechanics made the same recommendations and the quote was actually less. (consistent, honest - not really impressive they outbid a mopar/jeep shop from colorado, but honesty and consistency are worth the price.)
ads gets a rare five stars from me, when my daily driver comes off warranty it will go to ads too.

324,positive,"i've been coming here for almost two years now, i had a bad experience at the pep boys near by and decided to venture here. they have been doing my oil changes every time i need one, they have fixed radiator hose, and my check engine light came on and they fixed my car for $80 which was a shockingly good deal compared to other research i had looked up prior. will be back this week for my oil change"
325,positive,i have been to this shop for a muffler delete and a new muffler thrown on after a month. the shop has not let me down and has done good to my bmw. very nice seating area along with a clean shop. will be returning in the future for my exhaust needs.
326,positive,"i made the mistake of trusting a friend to replace the tranny on my chevy silverado. he got a tranny he said was rebuilt, but we could never get the truck working with the new one. so long story short, i spent over $2,000 and a month's worth of time to try letting my friend do it. -- i'm not sure if they just felt bad for me after hearing this story, but advanced transmission gave me a better price to rebuild the tranny than my friend cost me. they finished it within 3 business days, it now works great, and i trust that they'll be there should something go wrong. was great working with them!"
327,positive,"after having an issue at another midas store and wrote a review on google, i was immediately contacted by the owner of this midas and was asked to bring my car to the summerlin (w. charleston) location to have it looked at and repaired...i went in and was met with the nicest bunch of guys! they took no time getting under the hood and realizing what the issue was and scheduling me for the next day, as they had to order the parts. the owner bob and the manager ronnie(sp) went above and beyond to get my car repaired properly. there were a couple of minor issues that made the job time consuming, but the guy ( didn't get his name) working on my car got it done and did a wonderful job! left my car in great condition ( no grease or dirty hand prints or shoe marks) i will definitely make this my midas from now on!  thanks for everything!!! shawn cancelli"
328,positive,"i had a great experience at this location. sandra took care of me, got an oil change, transmission fluid change, radiator flush, ac service, cabin air filer replacement and overall inspection and fluid check. all good at reasonable prices given the quick service. even got a discounted car wash. i will be definitely coming back for oil changes."
329,positive,"i have been coming to this dealership for my service needs since it was located on hayden 8 years ago.   i recommend hyundai to all my friends and family.   the service area never does me wrong, no matter if it is for a simple oil change or a check engine light, they are all top notch.  my service advisor for years recently left and so i was recently fortune it to start working with mike when i had to have my car towed in.   he was amazing, kept me informed on what was happening with my car, and when it would be ready.  thank you hyundai and everyone for taking care of me and my car.   hyundai customer for life!"
330,positive,"brought in a toyota with damage to the muffler, exhaust tip and pipe, in four hours the pipe and exhaust tip are repaired and the muffler had no damage as i had thought. wow. honest, fast, economical and it looks brand new. 

should have reviewed a couple of years ago because performance muffler installed a flowmaster exhaust on my 2007 tundra and i'm really happy with that, even five years later. can't recommend enough."
331,positive,"i want to personally thank ken for helping my husband and i out today. coulter nissan has told us multiple times that our car needed a transmission fluid flush. he explained that since our car has a cvt transmission, that it is not necessary and could be costly. he recommended us to aamco to have it inspected. we took our previous sentra here. these guys are the most amazingly honest mechanics i have ever met. we will continue to come here. highly recommended. 5 stars all the way."
332,positive,"as a woman i'm always skeptical about having my car repaired, however i was referred to certified collision by my insurance company and was pleasantly surprised.  first, the facility looks nothing like what you would expect, it was clean and new.  the manager and staff were professional and the repair that was done looked great.  i will definitely refer this business to my friends and family."
333,positive,"because of the heat, my windshield cracked. so i called clear quality auto glass and they came to my house and fixed it. my original window had window tint on it and i was worried that the new window wouldn't match my car, but it came out amazing! they did not only do great on replacing my window but the tint was incredible. it's great to be able to have both my window fixed and get my window tint installed all at once. i definitely recommend as you will not be disappointed!"
334,positive,"huge mahalo to army vet mike m. @ mello motive for savn my bacn after my van's rear transmission seal blew out, spun the bushing and dumped trans fluid all over i-10 on the way to travis afb from texas.  he reached out to multiple contacts and found a good used tailpiece and bushing for the trans and had me back on my journey before nightfall. he even worked past closing to wash down my undercarriage and back doors/windows which were coated with leaked fluid and road grime.  what are the chances of getting that type of quality service late on a friday afternoon!!!  on behalf of j&j worldwide services and travis i commend you for your competent and determined diligence in getting my company's van repaired.  you turned my weekend nightmare into a short delay and are a true credit to the auto repair industry.  god bless!"
335,positive,"i have bought tires for myself and daughter, had an ac compressor installed, had a side view mirror installed, tail pipe and muffler repairs, front end alignment, bumper repair, windshield replaced and flats repaired at marco's detailing.  i have been treated respectfully, always charged truthfully and i trust marko completely with my car!

336,positive,"when i moved to nevada, i searched for a shop that i could trust.  unfortunately it took me a few years before i discovered nationwide safety brakes and alignment center, and i felt like i was being taken advantage of at the other places.. its been about fifteen years, and i have only taken my cars here. pete always listens to what i have to say when i am describing the problems, and will ask questions that help him get an understanding of what i an trying to explain. i always feel like he is being truthful with me, and never like he is trying to sell me something that i don't actually need.  i take my cars here, and only here, for everything, not just alignments. although one time i needed a muffler, and pete referred me to his favorite muffler shop, but other than that i only go to nationwide safety brakes and alignment center."
337,positive,"these guys are super transparent when it comes to your car.  if there is an issue, they will show you what they found: for instance, if your transmission fluid needs to be changed, they will show you what color your fluid is versus where it should be.  if your battery needs to be changed, they will show you the test they performed and what your battery measured.  

i have an older car, 85k miles plus, and these guys do keep me informed with what needs to be changed when so i know ahead of time to budget for my next visit.  luckily i haven't had to get any major repairs done, but this place would be my first stop.  

my only issue with this place is the waiting area.  it could be spruced up a little to make it more comfortable for people waiting for their cars.  i know i'm being nit-picky but i hope the owner will read this."
338,positive,"so my wife recently ran into trouble with her equinox, she tells me she is going to call her friend/mechanic to have him look at it. (i was worried) unfortunately he discovers that she needs a new transmission. out of curiosity i called around for pricing and my god the difference was obvious. rob was straight up no hidden fees no delays in  availability and he didn't charge her an arm nor a leg. his price was more then reasonable and he was more then honest the whole way through. this is a reliable honest mechanic more importantly trust worthy. i recommend his shop completely."
339,positive,"i got my truck fixed here and it came back to me looking better than ever! they did an awesome job! eric was great and kept me informed every step of the way! if you need your car repaired come here, you wont be disappointed!"
340,positive,"thanks for being honest and straightforward, guys! they actually recommended that i call the dealership to find out if a repair would be covered under the transmission warranty, before agreeing to go ahead with the repairs. turns out it's covered, and they saved me couple hundred bucks. :):) can't beat that service!!"
341,positive,"this is my second excellent experience with muffler masters. they put a factory style muffler back on my ford excursion to bring the sound level back to stock.  they gave me some great options, completed the work quickly, and the welds and alignment are perfect. will be back for more when i need exhaust work!"
342,positive,"doesn't even feel like a shop; it's more like a lounge. the staff here are super fast and honest about any issues with your car. i had my transmission flushed, brakes replaced and busy buggy is where i have my oil changed every few months. they truly are a quality shop and if you want your car in proper working condition, take ur to busy buggy (bonus, the cookies are amazing)."
343,positive,"if i could give them 6 stars i would! on vacation the check engine flashed on me.  because i was driving home on a long drive i looked up mechanics on yelp and i trusted the reviews. got there early at 7am and they took my car in. they have an awesome waiting room with arcade games and a separate room with a tv and couches. they have wi-fi which was great because i had to do some work on my laptop. now as a female i'm always nervous to go to a mechanic but the service was amazing. the check engine light wasn't on when i arrived at rebel and the car was working. they asked thoughtful questions, checked the car and test drove it twice to make sure. because they weren't sure about what could be the problem they didn't feel comfortable taking my car apart just to charge me. wow! even though they weren't 100 percent sure they gave me some recommendations about what the problem could be and some estimates for when i got home. they told me that if i had the same problem on the road to try a few things. sure enough their recommendations worked and i got home safely."
344,positive,"i called about an unknown problem with my daughter's car that our mechanic thought should be looked at by a transmission expert. aaron told me to bring the car right in and it was checked out and the problem determined within an hour! we had to wait for parts that needed to be special ordered, but we were kept informed of the progress and i felt safe leaving it with them for a few days because of the secure parking area they have onsite. i will absolutely recommend this business to friends."
345,positive,"super fast work, removed stock exhaust (muffler and resonators) and replaced with magnapacks and an x pipe. my camaro ss finally sounds like a muscle car. also noticed improved performance because the exhaust isn't being throttled as much. thanks!!"
346,positive,"super friendly and very reasonable. called another muffler place and they were trying to charge me double the price!  thanks,  joe!"
347,positive,"i gave them a call they gave me all the information and pricing over the phone. their services was excellent and exceptional. i even also asked them if i could get it done as quickly as possible because i had to leave on the same day to colorado. they were able to do it. i had ask for a transmission flush & oil change. they told me it might take two hours. so they asked me if i had anyone to take me home and i told them no i'll just take an uber. the gentleman that was helping me order me a lyft and they paid for it. they also asked me if i need a lyft again to come pick up the car. that was so sweet of them to do. 
they email me the information about my car they did a free check up saying they couldn't do the transmission flush because they didn't have the tools to do it. i told them that was fine and understandable. they were able to do apple pay because i lost my credit card. i would recommend this place and will be coming back!"
348,positive,the reviews are right. you won't find a better muffler shop in the country let alone las vegas!  my truck sounds amazing!  thanks perfomance muffler!!!
349,positive,"i am giving my experience with josh bash ***** because of his diligence in making sure my needs were met.i am writing today to express my appreciation for joshua bash and the effort he put forth in making sure my needs were met. 
my 2012 nissan versa was recently towed to larry h miller from my mechanic's shop with transmission trouble. josh was informative and helpful from the start. he also displayed great patience and understanding when i voiced concerns or frustrations.
josh went above and beyond my expectations as a service advisor. i appreciated his communication, professionalism and willingness to keep pushing for me and my situation. i am very grateful that he was able to help me get the repairs that i needed done at a price i agreed with. i went into the experience frustrated and honestly, distrustful of dealerships. i am pleased to say that this experience has definitely opened my eyes to the fact that not every experience has to be like that."
350,positive,"i took my ford f150 to get a muffler installed, joe the manager and his crew were absolutely very hospitable, professional and very good service, i highly recommend this place they're good people."
351,positive,as always excellent customer service experience.  robert was wonderful today and the guys did an excellent job servicing my check engine light.
352,positive,"i brought my range rover sport in without an appointment on friday, march 29, 2019 around 5pm because my check engine light came on. chris c in service went above and beyond my expectations. long story short. it took 13 days to get my truck back(no appointment, contacting warranty company, ordering parts and lastly a road test). i was kept in the loop as to what was going on at all times. what i appreciated the most is that i was not turned away when i stopped in on a friday evening with no appointment and given a loaner. chris c truly exemplifies outstanding customer service."
353,positive,"great customer service, brought my car in today to see what if they could turn the check engine light off. i had already completed the repair and did not have accept to turn off the light. after about 5 shops. stamps did not miss a beat. got there scanner confirmed the codes. then erased the code and light!! customer service is harder and harder to find these days!! thank you stamps for taking time out of your day to help someone out without trying to make a sale.."
354,positive,"in auto repair i understand they have point checks and diagnostics.  and so goes the same for customer reviews.  for a business such as auto repair, i think its fair to base the primaries on professional and friendly customer service, quality, pricing, communication, and timing.

since we first brought our cars into a usa auto, the customer service at both locations have been highly superb.  this location is more convenient for us and we chose to continue our service here.  it's so convenient that when matrix died, corolla was able to nudge it under 10 minutes to this location.  

most previous repair services i've brought my vehicles into was the entire day's wait.  i expected to wait just as long so planned the day with errands while matrix was being revived.  it needed an alternator, battery, and transmission service.  i was also expecting to spend almost a thousand $$$.  far from it!  and on top of that the diagnostic cost was waived since matrix tested ""flat line"".

we slowly booted matrix into a parking spot roughly 10:15am on a saturday morning.  cody always attentive and walking out to greet while still parking in the lot.  salena awesome at making sure of service reminders.  matrix was ready to go home in roughly 3.5 hours.  dave and his crew - better than excellent!  matrix engine sounds really good for 159,000 mileage :d

dropping our vehicles off again for upcoming oil changes.  they raised the bar, i raised a star.  our vehicles have happily chosen their new care takers!"
355,positive,"the best place to get your car repaired!  bj hummel was amazing and great to work with. he kept in contact with me to keep me up to date on what was happening and also when my car was finished.  the final outcome was stunning, it did not look like it did when i brought it in, it looked brand new.   do not hesitate to use their services!!!"
356,positive,"had a check engine light, stopped in and although the shop was busy mike was clear about the length of time things would take. due to the vagueness of the check engine light it took quite a bit of time and attention, mike communicated with me throughout the whole process as to where things were and how it was going. once they figured out the problem, as with most unplanned car repairs it was more than i could really afford, with some creativity mike was able to get an acceptable part at a great price making this repair alot easier to stomach. this vehicle is a bmw so price of parts and cost to repair are always over the top expensive. repairs were made and my car was returned. a day later i was having a similar issue and mike went over and above to make sure i got the car back to him asap. he found a small issue and remedied the problem at no charge, this was a repair that could have fallen on my shoulders but because of mikes integrity and willingness to do what it takes to not only get a job done but make sure the customer is satisfied. if you are looking for shop i recommend this meineke."
357,positive,i'm so happy i switched from san tan ford to berge! i have had so many problems with my car and san tan ford just plain sucked! they wouldn't let me have a rental car so i sat for hours and waited. today i took my car in again to have the transmission fixed. berge fixed it the first time and in general the focus's transmission is awful so it's not their fault. today when i brought my car in tim drake helped me out and offered to get me set up with a rental car. i was shocked because no one has ever offered me that. i don't need it because i'm using my moms car. they are awesome!!!
358,positive,"this place was absolutely amazing and very very affordable. i have a 1995 ford bronco that two other shops charged me an arm and a leg for, and they still could not fix the leaking of my transmission. these guys diagnosed it for me and gave me a quote that was much less than the other guys who did not even fix it. they were done in half a day and i have not had one drip of oil or transmission fluid on my driveway since. i would recommend these people at any time and they have earned my business for life."
359,positive,good price. professional service. appointments are carried out at appointed time. no better muffler shop in vegas.
360,positive,"normally i take my van to an area tire chain store for regular vehicle maintenance, i.e. oil changes, tire balancing,  rotation & alignment.  during my last visit, the tech mentioned that because of the age of the van (13 yrs., 108k miles & oe suspension system) that i should consider replacing the shocks and struts.  while i never experienced any excessive bouncing or handling, his comment played in the back of my mind.  fast forward several months, i started hearing rumblings from my exhaust system.  having had a favorable experience with monro earlier in the year fixing the exhaust system on my toyota, i decided to take my van into them for the muffler and have them check out the suspension system. the manager, robert gaiser, assured me that they found no leakage or need to replace any of the suspension parts, but that i needed a new muffler. not only do i feel that i got a fair price on the muffler, but i felt that i was treated like a valued customer as mr. gaiser was very cordial as he took the time to answer all my questions. job was completed on time as promised.  would recommend this shop for servicing and car repairs."
361,positive,"i've read some negative reviews about this shop. frankly, i'm puzzled. if you own a german car, most people realize that owning one that is 'out-of-warranty' for a number of years after the warranty has expired; can be quite costly. for those of us who find german cars not only appealing as a means of transportation, but also; as a hobbie - we value long-lasting relationships with competent mechanics and engaged owners of independent car shops.

short-sighted thinking that after only (1) visit - you should attempt to destroy the reputation of a well-meaning and competent group of automotive engineers just because you didn't receive what you expected - is - well - short sighted.

i have 3 bmws that are professionally and reliably maintained by eurowise. i've seen good and bad mechanics arrive and leave eurowise over the last 3 years that i've done business with them. frankly - only the good ones are left. if you value long-lasting relationships as it pertains to the cars we love and drive - then i would suggest giving these guys a 2nd and even 3rd chance. after all, a small squabble over a $100 repair bill is nothing - compared to what you'll eventually wind up paying for more significant repairs to your german car over time (like timing-chains, coolant re-seals, transmission repairs etc ...)

not only are the technicians and management team fair in their pricing - they absolutely stand by their work - no questions asked. and they are a great group of guys on top of their game!

so from a real german car enthusiast to the rest of you - remember - don't sweat the small stuff. these guys are the real mccoy - and i wouldn't trust a dealer to look at or touch any of my vehicles ever again. talk to marcel or mike. they'll make your situation right."
362,positive,"price: unbeatable 
wait time: substantial
work: not perfect, but for the price it's great. 
the shop is first come, first serve. they open on saturday 8am-12pm. i arrived at 7:30 and was second in line. my car was not finished until 10am but the crowd in the waiting room passed the time by chatting with one another so it was a pleasant experience. i brought a cat back system and had it installed here, i also asked them to cut the mufflers out and replace them with a straight pipe. i requested that they re-use the stock exhaust hangers and weld the system (which was in pieces) together but not to modify or attach anything permanent to the car itself. the welds aren't superiorly beautiful but they're functional and neat. this shop also does exhaust repair, custom systems, muffler deletes and more."
363,positive,it's so hard to walk into a place for a service you know nothing about...however my experience with performance muffler was great! the staff are very helpful and quick to get the job done! thanks guys for taking care of me!!
364,positive,"where to start?  5 stars!  would give 6 if i could.  nice guy with great temperament, easy to talk to, keeps long hours (all day sat!), knows how to fix things, prices are lower than they should be, no wait, lots of space on the lot.  can even walk across the street for coffee.

he says he's had the franchise for about a year, so older reviews are not relevant. very, very pleasant young man, jon, who knows his stuff.  the older guy also inspires confidence (a we-do-it-right sort of guy).  other customers look like good company, nice clean shop.

i've had a lot of great mechanics over the years on porsches, benzes, alfas, acura, mazda, jag...).  fully confident this monro can take care of my current 82 fiat, 93 alfa, 97 maxima, 98 subaru, and 02 highlander. 
i'm an engineer who likes older cars, so i have to know the good mechanics wherever i live (my last mechanics did race prep for carroll shelby on his austin healys back in the day, signed photo on the wall).  

jon's oil change is about $20 cheaper than everyone else, with full filter change and plug-out drip-drain (no gimmicks).  he did calipers, muffler sections, o2 sensors, and differential oil changes for us that were not cheap.  i looked them up:  the internet said the cost could have been 1.5x to 2x what he charged.  this shop doesn't upsell either -- just does what's needed or what's asked for.

final word?  i'm writing this because i'm disappointed with the guys down the road who asked $3000+ to get the nissan back on the road (jon just did it for $541).  those other guys charged $250 just to look at it, said they sent a video (they didn't, and i didn't ask them to), and the kicker?  those other guys lost the emissions paperwork i needed to register the car.  wow.  that's the competition.  this monro (dover center road, bay village) is so much better.

my wife agrees, this monro is where we'll be doing all our work now, and it's right off lake road, très convenient.  we've tried several other shops in the immediate area, but this is easily the best."
365,positive,"ever since i purchased my cute little red ford focus, i had problems with the transmission​ and went to 3 different ford dealers to fix it. i mentioned this to @nick wheeler when i brought my car in for a recall, who not only knew the sound the car made when it acted up, he told me the problem was really with the clutch, and he would fix it for free, as it was under warranty​​. it took a while to get the recall parts and the clutch so nick got me a free rental and kept me in the loop every day. when i got my car back, it was unrecognizable! it's so much fun to drive! lot's of pep and energy. charges up hills like a chap. i'm just thrilled to be back in love with my car again."
366,positive,"thanks for working on my car. got an engine oil cz, engine coolant flush, and transmission flush."
367,positive,"i haven't even got my car back (lexus sc400) and i'm already giving these guys 5 stars.  instead of ""throwing parts"" at a driveline vibration they put my lexus uup on the rack, spun the wheels and showed me a u-joint problem and a problem necessitating replacement of the differential.  when i said, ""how much $ for the diagnosis"" the answer....nothing!  so now they're installing a replacement diffie for me, rebuilding the drive shaft, and i have no doubt the car will come back smooth and quiet.   too bad arrowhead lexus simply pointed their finger at the transmission mounts as the cause of all the problems."
368,positive,"i highly recommend auto specialists. i was traveling from las vegas back to arizona and my transmission acted up near boulder city.  my father had just passed away 4 days prior to my leaving, i was still in shock. 
so now the car! i called this establishment and talked with lee, who made me feel better. she told me that they were going to take care of me and they sure did. top knot has and compassion too!  the price tag was steep because of the vacuum valve in the transmission but well worth it. they really did make me feel better and i recommend them for fast  courteous service.  thank you lee!"
369,positive,"i just moved to vegas and i found out quickly that there were a lot of shady auto repair shops around here, not to mention i heard a lot of horror stories of people getting ripped off and being told things were fixed when they weren't. h-tech auto is not one of those shops.

pete is a great mechanic. he is honest and more than reasonable, and will take you into the garage so you can see any problems with your car. normally i don't get too many things done at once on my car with a new shop, but i took that risk with h-tech auto and i was glad i did. i had the timing belt and water pump replaced (among other things), transmission fluid (and the axle seal), brake pads, etc. done in one sitting. on top of that, he solved my long-term emissions problem. 

another positive is that they use oem parts, not the cheap aftermarket parts that are likely to be ineffective. 

i have definitely found my go-to auto shop now. thank you for saving me money, my car, and being completely trustworthy!"
370,positive,"i had a great experience at this shop. the expensive borla exhaust that i brought to them for installation was ""slightly off"" in how it was put together. the tips were uneven to the bumper by about 1/2"". i could hardly tell but the shop manager was extremely detail oriented and would not stand for an imperfect result! i had already gotten my quote for the installation ($80) but he insisted on cutting pipes, aligning the muffler tips, and rewelding the exhaust until it was perfect. he didn't charge me another cent and really made me feel like i was doing him a favor by letting him satisfy his ocd. :-)
want your exhaust done right? bring your car here."
371,positive,"this summer i had the misfortune of speeding along the highway when a pallet fell off a truck and quickly proceeded to damage the front end of my car.  still drivable, i limped home my 2011, infiniti g37 and started chatting with my insurance company about the repair.  while they had several recommendations, positive word of mouth led me to usa collision.  on my first visit to their shop i had the opportunity of meeting with their president, david robinson and found his straight forward candor and desire to please the customer a refreshing experience.  when i gave him the challenge that if i was going to pay a $1,000 co-pay to my insurance, i not only wanted my car repaired, but i wanted to add some custom flair, he didn't bat an eye.  throughout the process he helped me add unique touches to my g, as well as kept an eye on my budget and time frame.  the end result was a g37 unlike any on the road, that i am both proud of and confident that it was repaired well.  thank you usa collision for your attention to detail and professionalism."
372,positive,"just want to say a big thank you to the gentleman who took care of my wife today as well as our 2008 honda civic which needed some special treatment to it, i.e. transmission flush as well as fuel injector service and a smog check.​ my wife said the vehicle rides and runs smoother. our honda needed it that's for sure.

i briefly​ spoke to you on the phone and you sounded like you knew what you were talking​ about so i o.k.ed the service and also thanks for the deep discount you gave us so now we know where to bring our vehicles in the future. you've convinced me that you're​ my go too for any service that i need. thanks so much.................

373,positive,my car was unfortunately hit while parked. thankfully i had full coverage and my insurance worked directly with abra to get my car repaired quickly. steve was very professional and kept me updated on the status of my repairs. when i went to go pick up my car steve greeted me in a timely matter and showed me the repairs done to my car. they even took the time to buff out the headlights (which i've been neglecting) and clean the interior. my car looked better than before it was hit. the repairs are even covered for life. steve even said that if i had a problem with any of the repairs to contact him and he'll take care of it himself.
374,positive,"i went into this firestone because my check engine light was on and i was thinking my oil might be low. i told them about my check engine light and mentioned it might be my oil. i asked if i could purchase a couple quarts to top off my oil if that was the problem. the manager, john, told me to pull my car behind one of the other cars getting worked on and he would have one of his guys see if my oil was the problem for the light. hunter, was nice enough to see that my oil was low and topped it off for me free of charge. he also cleared my check engine light so i could be on my way. you could see the shop was pretty busy, but they still went out of their way to help me out and they were so kind to do this free of charge. it truly was appreciated and you don't see that very often with car shops. thank you to john and hunter and to firestone on deer valley! acts like this definitely don't go unnoticed!"
375,positive,"our check engine light went on after idling in the arizona heat. being from out of town, we started calling all subaru dealerships in the greater phoenix area and got turned away from all but subaru superstore of surprise.  brandon w. (service advisor) was nice enough to take us at our earliest convenience to run a diagnostic test. once we arrived, brandon remembered why we can come in and was ready to check our car. not only did he provide us with a full explanation of the issue but was kind enough to send us home with the error message and part number for our home dealership. we appreciated the peace of mind brandon gave us knowing the car was safe for the road trip back home."
376,positive,after years of great service can't say enough good things about greg and his  team.  very fair and very good  thanks advanced transmission  !! john and darla b.
377,positive,"the best thing about coming to chinatown district for auto repair is that it costs half the price of auto repair services anywhere else in the valley. 

this place is a little difficult to find because it's located behind the tofu hut restaurant. it's not very visible from the streets. 

what i like the best about busy buggy is that they answer questions, and they answer the questions honestly. they don't feed you misleading information like 99% of the other auto repair places do. for example, many of the other auto repair places will say things like: ""you must only use the specific transmission fluid that your car's factory produces or your engine will die. that's why we gotta charge you more because we can't use a generic brand."" now everyone who does their own auto repairs at home knows that is bullsh!t. i've been using a generic transmission fluid for the last 90k miles and my car runs like it's new. here at bb motors, they won't lie to you like they would at the other auto repair shops. 

what makes this place especially great is that they do every kind of repair.  when my  engine light came on while driving to california, i first went to a guy in orange county(larry's auto repair), and he quoted me at around $4000 to fix it. i drove over here and the guy comes back to me a few minutes later and tells me it was from a previous ""misfire"" and that the car's computer system was merely getting confused and that no repairs were necessary. holy sh!t!! now that's one honest guy!!!! he saved me $4000!!! and he said that even if my engine was having the type of problem that the previous scammer claimed, it would never cost that much. 

i will admit that i hate having to take my car in for an oil change. i'm one of those guys who needs to do it himself. changing my own oil at home is actually one of my hobbies, and i used to look forward to it every 3 months. but, i recently moved into a community in the providence district of las vegas that provides no garage or space where i can jack up my car and change my oil. so nowadays i have no choice but to bring it in. the pros of bringing my car in to busy buggy for an oil change is that it actually costs less! if i purchased 4 quarts of quaker state(the least expensive), and an oil filter, it would come out to around $18.00. here at bb i think it was like $12.00 for 4.5 quarts of high quality castrol, oil filter, and they even check your air pressure, rotate you tires, fill your wiper fluid, check all fluid levels, and check your air filter, all for free. that's a great deal!

customer service is great. it's like being at one of those 1950's full service garages from the old movies. the workers are all dressed nice and clean, and everything in the shop is so well organized. i've never seen such a spotless garage before. 

i can't believe how fast they get your car onto the lift. at all the other auto repair shops, they let your car sit in the parking lot for a while, and then some extremely obese guy covered in motor oil, waddles out to your car all lethargically. usually it takes him about 5 minutes just to walk from the entrance of the garage to your car. here at bb, the moment you drop your car off, they sprint out, jump in, and jack it up for repairs. it literally looks like those nascar maintenance guys working on your car.  

5-stars and my favorite auto repair shop in the world."
378,positive,"took my 2002 jeep wrangler there for issues i had related to passing smog and a check engine light.  from the time shlomi took my initial call until my service was complete, everything went smooth.  shlomi is honest man, easy to talk to and very knowledgeable. 

i recommend him highly!"
379,positive,"made an appointment after perusing yelp reviews for local muffler shops.  was surprised to see a ""not so nice"" yelp review of a repair shop that i had used in the past, so decided to try monro after reading their reviews.  the exhaust pipe from my catalytic converter to my muffler had broken. as a former weekend mechanic, i got under the car to examine. i knew that all i needed was a piece of pipe spliced between the two pipes. after leaving the car at the shop, was wondering whether they'd call and try to ""talk me"" into a new exhaust system...well, they didn't!  picked the car up and paid what they had quoted;  i'm now driving around and once again able to hear my radio  - thanks monro!"
380,positive,"no one likes needing to get their car fixed. it's even less fun when your car is new.

a coyote ruined my day unexpectedly (i guess i ruined his day too...) and caused what looked like superficial damage to my one-year-old crv. inconvenient, but no big deal. i'm pretty new to the area and no one had any shop recommendations for me, so i scoured google and yelp and kept seeing great reviews for orlando. i checked out their website and i was sold (really, go check it out!).

these guys know their stuff, and they're thorough. what seemed like a fairly minor accident ended up being pretty major - the coyote hit a lot of parts on his way out. a lot of them were only damaged a little bit, but orlando found all the damage, and replaced every. single. part. i also got updates from them along the way explaining what needed fixing and what the eta would be.

not only was everyone so nice, and not only does the work come with a warranty, but they washed and did a basic detail on my car. all my dog's nose smudges were cleaned off the windows (don't worry, she's replaced most of them already!) and all the dust and dog fur wiped and vacuumed. in and out it was cleaned with care, when the dealer doesn't even bother to run it through the wash when i go in for service.

at every interaction i felt like they cared about me, my car, and the quality and detail put into their work. this is how a small business stands out from the crowd. i hope i never have to get my car repaired again, but if i do, this is where i will go."
381,positive,"i was referred to this place because my regular mechanic couldn't figure out what was wrong. every time i took off from a stop my car didn't want to get in gear. it would take a couple times of pressing the gas pedal then jump into gear. i was expecting a huge bill. however, the mechanic found three wires that needed to be replaced and i paid under $100. my car is running great now. the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. this is the place to go for transmission issues."
382,positive,we've taken our vehicle here for some check engine light issues. staff here is hard working and honest. they do their best to locate the issue and fix it. i'll definitely comeback. pricing is decent too.
383,positive,"when one of our company vehicles started having transmission problems, i thought they would immediately tell us we needed a new transmission.  not only is that expensive, but our money making vehicle would be down for a couple days.  to my surprise they recommended flushing first because they didn't want to jump to conclusions.  not only did the flush work, my guy and truck was back on the road within an hour (i didn't even make an appointment) saving me thousands.  after the flush, they checked back with me & the driver to make sure everything was running smoothly, who does that, no one expect advanced."
384,positive,"we were in an accident recently and needed to get our car repaired 
i looked up car repair shops in our area and found chaneys
today we came to pick up our car and i have to say, it looks like a brand new car 
chaneys was very good about keeping us updated with everything 
i highly recommend it 
hopefully we won't need to use them again but if we did, it would definitely be chaneys"
385,positive,"on my way from california to vegas my car stalled and lost acceleration. i pulled over and noticed the check engine light and that there was minimal oil. we kept driving in hopes and prayers going 25- 60 mph with the gas pedal all the way down. when we finally got to vegas and let the car cool the following morning we checked the oil and it had the bare minimum. i had an oil change from kia the prior week so i was baffled as to why there was no oil. 

i called busy buggy and spoke to marco inquiring about a knock sensor because i had received a p1326 code and also let him know there was no oil in the car. he recommended we put oil in the car and to bring it over. so we did. 

thankfully i did not need a sensor but only an oil change and he removed the check engine light. i'm still baffled as to where my oil went because he showed me that there were no leaks and the oil was not burning. 

i still had  about 2k miles to go for a new oil change. i'm not sure if the oil change was necessary or if he could of just removed the check engine light and i could of just added more oil. 

marco is really nice and he did help but.... he also tried to get me to buy more from him. 

he stated i needed a new air filter which i bought.

and he also said my back breaks were ""metal to metal"" and if i wanted to get them done it would be $270ish. i told him no he said they had a guarantee of 12,000 miles. (i don't even live in vegas and it doesn't make sense to me as to why i would drive to another state to get my breaks done after 12k) also i just had them checked the week prior and was told they were good by kia and which i went to kia again after i got back home and told them that i was told my breaks were metal to metal. kia stated they were ""not"" metal to metal and they were 6/32 and new are 10's. 

i will give both of them the benefit of the doubt. 

i was charged $50 to have my car looked at for leaks which i did not argue.. i did not have time.. although when i was on the phone i wish i would of been told about the charge when he said ""come on in! we will check it out."" 

he also keeps the lobby and restroom clean and stocked. 

overall i'm just glad my car was taken care of and good to go back on the road!"
386,positive,ken and bo found why my check engine light would not shut off after the replace the o2 sensor twice the found 4 broken wires and if i would of left it that way it could of took out my computer. they save me some money and they do a great job every time i bring a vehicle in.
387,positive,"quick service, honored the workmanship warranty.

our car was overheating when the a/c was turned on, our extended warranty works with meineke, so we brought it here to get check. they found the issue and was able to replace the part the same day, used our warranty coverage and we left just paying a small deductible and sales tax.

car worked great for a few days and it was overheating with the check engine light. so we had to tow it back to this location. they were busy and said it would be a bit, but we understood. soon after we left, thinking it might need to stay overnight, they called us back within the hour. said it was a loose connection with the part new part. had it reinstalled and tightened, we could go back to pick it up anytime before closing.

although there was a mishap in their installation the first time, in which they apologized for. they didn't try to up sell anything or tag on additional issues that needed fixing. it was an honest replace, repair, warranty honored!"
388,positive,"called when i had an issue with my car they got me in that day and out in an hour and twenty minutes. they even checked my ac for free and checked my transmission after being told by another shop there was a leak. customer service was fantastic and i never once felt as if i was pressured or talked down too. this will be my go to place when my car needs anything done. friendly staff, great service give them a shot if you car needs a checkup."
389,positive,"had my car repaired at caliber and i couldn't be more happy with the work. lindsay took great care of me. she made sure i was aware of the process the whole time and when i got my car back it was earlier than i was told it would be. i have dealt with collision centers in the past and the experience was not very pleasant. i am pleased to know that they are not all the same. i will never have any of my vehicles repaired anywhere else. if you are looking for a reliable, trustworthy place that knows what they are doing this is it. go in and see lindsay, you won't be disappointed."
390,positive,"had my car inspected, 4 new tires and oil change. quick, friendly and reasonably priced service. the updates done to the shop really make the building stand out and adapt to the new renovations of east liberty. highly recommend this aamco location to anyone looking to get their car worked on, right! not just a transmission shop! i will be putting the word out about the great service here."
391,positive,"my youngest daughter is in the us army stationed out of state. she has a car but it's here in az and an older one so she wanted something new with a warranty. after a lot of research, she decided she wanted a hyundai kona. i called several dealerships to find the color and options she wanted, however none of the dealerships had exactly what she wanted.  we made an open appointment with kevin and showed up saturday.  kevin introduced us to dj who handled the salesman duties for us.  we drove two different models to see which engine/transmission combo she wanted. she picked the 1.6 turbo that only comes in the limited/ultimate trim level. kevin, dj and the team worked hard to get us the financing and price that fit our daughter's budget. it took a little longer than they had anticipated so kevin bought us supper that evening.  our overall experience at earnhardt hyundai was a pleasant one and we definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an honest deal. thanks!"
392,positive,took my car transmission rebuilt got it back in two days  very satisfied with the work and did everything they said they would do will return for any future work thanks
393,positive,"when one goes looking for a low priced used car, one likely will find a dealer like gasparr.  recently i went looking for a used low price auto that i wanted for just sports like fishing and bicycling.  i came across gasparr and decide to check it out despite poor reviews,  i met the manager and he showed me a few. the one car i knew about from an ad was not to my liking and i asked him what else he might have.  the manager was knowledgeable and there was absolutely no pressure.   he never tried to tell me the cars were gone over by mechanics and cleaned up like at the uptown dealers. this is to be expected at such places.   i suspect the bad reviews came from people who did not fully understand the place in the market such small low price dealers occupy.   so he showed me a great car, blemish free, new tires and (relatively) low mileage. he said  that to cover his concern that since it was 10 years old something might break he would pay for a warranty policy to cover major iitems for 3 months. seemed more than fair.   i paid cash so i do not know about financing. but a few days later the quality of gasparr was put to the test.   i began to have problems with the transmission. i called to explain and without a moment's hesitation the manager said to bring it back - he'll fix it.  i drove the car back and within a few days he fixed it no extra charge!   another test came a few days later when the transmission gave me a second problem. called again and once again without hesitation - and in a matter of hours - he sent a tow truck to bring the car back for the transmission adjustment.  this time the car was fixed in one day.   look, it is an older car, full of old car surprises. gasparr could have stuck me with it, he did not. he made it right without a hassle of any kind!   he far exceeded any expectation i had about how a small low priced car dealer would behave.   could not be happier with my new old car."
394,positive,"my son, who is only in arizona for school, took his car into all pro transmission because the transmission was acting funny. jim said the wiring harness had been chewed by vermin, which caused the transmission to fail so needed to find the problem and fix it before driving it. my son knew before he left for school there was wiring issues. jim had several mechanics/experts look at it and try to find solutions without the expense of a new wiring harness, with no luck. it took almost 30 days for this process, including the time it took to replace the transmission.  he then recommended louie at meet your mechanic. louie found the problem quickly and was able to resolve the issue at a reasonable cost. jim tried to resolve the matter in his shop, i only wish he would have recommended louis/meet your mechanic sooner. so far no issues and my son has been driving it for a few weeks. jim was gracious to incur the expenses these others had charged, and also towed the car for my son to louis' shop. thank you for that, jim! the cost of the transmission was fair and reasonable. i felt jim was honest, caring and very much wanted to save us from more financial burden."
395,positive,"i went to dave's auto service on pflaum road, madison , wi. service advisor informed me to go online and register on yelp.com. to get a 20 percent discount on my service. great advice saved 24 dollars on change transmission fluid. each time that is applied great info. free wi fi , beverage and tv."
396,positive,"just left with a 6.2l yukob sounding like a v8 is supposed to. did a highway run at 75mph.  the magnaflow they recommended put the perfect amount of growl into wide open throttle with little to no noticeable drone at low rpm in 4 or 8 cylinder mode. this is the 4th or 7th time in 20 years these guys listened to what i asked for and nailed on the first go. 

need muffler/exhaust work?  go here everytime. 

update:  did a 2800 mile trip and no issues with the tone. quiet cabin, until you mat it. then, yep, the appropriate amount of get-out-of-the-way growl."
397,positive,"i was in an accident where in my car was struck from behind by another vehicle. i took my vehicle to a nationwide blue ribbon repair shop in my area. a month later they called to let me know my vehicle was repaired. i took my car to pack brothers in belmont for a vehicle repair inspection. long story short, pack brothers discovered that my car had not been repaired at all...just covered up. they determined that my ""repaired"" car was not safe to drive. with help from pack brothers and collision safety consultants, nationwide insurance and their blue ribbon repair shop was forced to correct the problem. had it not been for these fine folks, i'd probably still be fighting to get my vehicle fixed. i live a couple hundred miles away from pack brothers, but this is where i'll take my next damaged vehicle. don't be strong armed by an insurance company who isn't interested in your satisfaction. according to nc state law, where you get your car repaired in your choice. my choice from this day forward is pack brothers."
398,positive,"best service... period...

i knew i needed a new transmission and advanced transmission was my 3rd call to get info... as soon as the phone was answered by denise i had a good feeling about their business... she sent me to bill... not only did he ask all the correct questions he was able to answer all my questions... he explained there were 3 main choices for a new transmission... after a few minutes he didn't try and upsell me... he told me the most expensive would be more than i needed... recommended the middle choice and it was over $800 less than the other 2 calls... at that point i was confident this was the place... bill put me at ease about spending a good chunk of money... greg also is top notch with knowledge and customer service... their technitions went above and beyond what i expected... there was another underlaying problem and was able to trouble shoot it with no cost... they did the other repair and i checked other places out if curiosity... saved another $200... do not... i repeat do not hesitate going with advanced transmissions... from outstanding customer service to the outstanding workmanship... thank you denise, bill and greg... along with all their technicians"
399,positive,"recently brought my tacoma in for an inspection after seeing leakage around the transmission oil pan during a recent oil change.  i also asked for a tire rotation.  they emailed me a complete inspection report/findings w/ pictures.  the inspection and tire rotation was free.  i then scheduled to have the tranny oil pan seal replaced a couple days later.  no hassles here, no up selling on things that don't need to be done.  i'll definitely be coming back here."
400,positive,i have found my new mechanic!!! i highly recommend shlomi and his team here at a b-z auto.  i dropped my car off  at 8:15 with a failed smog and a check engine light on. shlomi took me right in and he was done by 1:30! he went above and beyond to take care of me and sent me on my way with my passing smog ! and then called me the next day to ask how my car was running.  thank you for the excellent service!  oh! and did i mention how nice and clean the waiting area is?! wow!!!! i will send all i know to a b-z auto! !!
401,positive,"i've had exhaust work done at other muffler shops it's been poorly welded and exhaust leaks within the first month :(.  so i decided to come to performance muffler by people's ratings on here and on google and they are right, excellent  quality, and inexpensive work love the dual muffler setup on my 1993 chevy 454ss. thanks joe, job well done my wife is really happy with her truck and the way it sounds really brought are truck to life.  star rating from us both.  keep up the good work. i will be referring a bunch of friends that are working on projects and are asking about a good muffler shop."
402,positive,"excellent service!

i brought my land rover here for transmission issues. terry was at the desk and was super friendly. i am always apprehensive about new shops as we all usually worry about having people charge and charge us for everything and all the auto repair stereotypes. 

i found huff to have given me honest advice and they quickly ascertained what the issues were and called me to give me options. 

a rare shop that gave good service!"
403,positive,went to dimaggio's with what seemed to be a loose muffler making a clunking sound. dimaggio's took care of the problem quickly and fixed what was a loose hanging clamp. i was amazed that they did this and said there would be no charge for the repair. i will certainly take my vehicle to dimaggio's for all future service.
404,positive,"busy buggy. been coming here for about 3 years. it's started with a simple oil change 3 years ago, came in and was greeted and offered cookies and beverages. been coming here for small things ever since. but not until thursday of last week was i fully thankful. took my wife's car in. turns out it was the transmission. go figure. 2011 chevy equinox with less than 100k miles. they took about a week, waiting for the dealership to deliver etc. finally picked it up today and i am glad i brought it here. honest hard working owner and team. will continue to come here as long as i'm treated fairly as i have for the past 3 years. thanx busy buggy car is running like the first time i took it out of the dealership and wife is extremely happy. owner hamid i think that's his name is an honest guy from what i've come to know of him. will continue to come here and send u more of my friends."
405,positive,"took my car here to get some damaged repaired and from the first call i made to set up an appointment, to picking up my vehicle the staff there made it super easy. dennis was amazing, he answered all of my questions and explained everything and he was really nice and listened to all of my concerns. the repairs were done quickly and my car was ready when they said it would be. i would definitely return here if i ever have a need to get a car repaired again."
406,positive,"rotary evolution is a highly skilled, very knowledgeable engine builder and mechanic.  i've owned several rx-7's (2nd and 3rd generation) and kept only two.  one is a low mileage well-maintained, unmodified street machine.  and the other is a track car repaired by ben, the owner of rotary evolution.

as many in the rx-7 community can appreciate, these cars are aging homes to various gremlins that can be difficult to troubleshoot and diagnose.  my car had a phantom fuel issue for several years.  i spent two years taking it to various mazda / rotary shops in the bay area, to no avail.  many hours and literally $thousands had been thrown at the problem with absolutely no results.  i was ready to give up and ditch the car, but the online rotary community came to the rescue and recommended the services of rotary evolution.  basically, i told ben, ""i don't care how long you have it, what you do, or how long it takes.  just let me know when it's done."" ben literally spent a hundred hours over the following months tinkering with the car and finally sorted out the problem using some unorthodox procedures.

they charged a very reasonable rate and i couldn't have been happier with the result.  as i continued making modifications and improvements, i hired rotary evolution for two dyno tuning sessions.  with a properly designed exhaust and ignition + fuel map corrections, ben was able to raise its power output by +33 hp at the wheels, which is pretty good for a naturally aspirated 13b.

the engine itself was rebuilt by rotary evolution for the car's previous two owners.  ben was very forthcoming in describing some of the limitations that were holding it back from making the power that it should, and suggested further modifications for a future rebuild.  i recently sent him a set of rotor housing to resurface.  upon receipt, he reminded me that, for track purposes, they need exhaust port modification, and offered to do it for a good price.

if i ever again come across an unsolvable problem with any rotary-powered car, i'd be willing to ship or make the drive to las vegas and hand it over to rotary evolution.

las vegas is lucky to have a world-class engine builder that knows rx-7's inside and out!"
407,positive,"i came here for the first time to get my oil changed. 
marco came to me afterwards and let me know my starter was having issues & then quoted me for what that would cost to fix it.

i took it in the next day to get the service done & they told me it should only take an hour. well...they had my car for 8 hours that day and didn't tell me what was going on with it. (this is the only thing i wasn't happy about) 
when i came to pick up the car, marco told me they thought the issue had to do with my transmission control module & there was a code coming up on my car to get it fixed by ford as it was a recall. 
marco promised me that if i took it to ford and they told me it had nothing to do with my starter- that he would refund me.

well, long story short- that's exactly what happened. thank you to marco who made sure i didn't get ripped off or have to pay extra money for something that was never broken on my car. i really appreciated his willingness to take ownership of the mis-diagnosis & for being so transparent at the end. 

he has my trust & i will come here for future work for sure!"
408,positive,we have been bringing our mercedes s550 and our range rover sport here since we moved to arizona about 4 years ago. they have been more than fair and always a help to me and my wife even when i am out of town for months at a time. they always give us their full attention every time even if it's just for the check engine light being on. we are always confident that when we drop our cars off that it always comes back running like a champ. thank you for all that you guys do for us.
409,positive,"mike saved me from an imminent meltdown tonight. 

my cars transmission blew. i left my car at the auto shop, but forgot to take my house key off the ring. i get home after the shop is closed. i have a 4 year old with me. 

i look up locksmiths nearby and get ahold of mike. i kid you not, he was at my house five minutes later and got me and my kid back inside. 

he is professional, friendly, and incredibly fast. if i ever am this stupid again, i'll definitely know who to call."
410,positive,such friendly people i had my transmission redone and they were very friendly and answered all my questions and even when i came in with my front bumper dangling a bit off they fixed my bumper when i didnt even mention it i was so happy and thanked them for my new transmission and for my bumper fix..thank you guys i appriciate it so much..
411,positive,rebel has the best customer service! my check engine light turned on and my registration was due in a few days. the guys at rebel are so awesome they took my car in to get smogged for me the same day my registration was due because they knew they were going to need to keep my car to run the proper test to turn it back over to me. they called me to let me know i can go online and pay my registration before it was due before 5pm to avoid any late fees. thank you so much rebel automotive you make having to take a car into a mechanic a lot less stressful!!!!!
412,positive,"i have been using advanced transmissions for over 10 years -- my family and business, and they have always provided a+ service. my first major experience was about 10 years ago. the honda dealership quoted $4,200 to fix my transmission and advanced transmissions did it for $2,200, and it worked great. this morning, i called them to fix my daughter's starter. they arranged for the tow and the car was completed by 1:00 pm. their quick service sure made my day go much easier. the owner greg has always been super helpful to me over the years."
413,positive,"i am always slightly skeptical about a business who has 5/5 stars. especially with so many reviews. how can this be?! well, after witnessing the service level at t & m i can say that i get it now. 

i was set to drive from las vegas to denver, co but the week prior my check engine light came on. i checked my gas cap, opened the hood of my car to pretend like i knew what to look for. i did it all. i called around and the only place who could run a diagnostic was this place. thankfully nothing was wrong but i was so impressed with their kindness that i made an appointment to get my oil changed the day i was leaving town. 

they were so nice and remembered me. while i waited they made small talk with me in the lobby and were calling customers to remind them about oil changes or parts updates. they knew almost everyone by name that came in. it was impressive. 

my oil change was under $60 and they were quick (with an appointment). i'm sure hearing from any repair shop that you're going to have to form over a bunch of money for a repair isn't fun but i'd rather hear it from and support a place i trust."
414,positive,"i've had 3 of my cars here for an exhaust work and every single one has been a great experience.  i have been to other muffler shops in the past and these guys do a better job with the overall work, customer service and professional conduct.  they really also warranty their work which is may not be the case elsewhere.  the owner is always around and ensures you're happy with the final product."
415,positive,"a+ work, honest and friendly. far less expensive than any dealer!

if you have a vw or audi, don't take it anywhere else. the owner, derek has a love for all things vw and audi and knows every detail from basic maintenance to building full boosted race cars. he has personally maintained my audi tt and easily drafted up the plans for a full turbo build. derek knows how to maintain the dsg transmissions, haldex quattro units and everything else quirky about the brand. if only i could bring all my vehicles to him!

personal suggestion is to not call or email exklusiv as they are always busy buried in car work. just show up!"
416,positive,"what an amazing experience! i went there to have them test and print up why my check engine light was on. while i was there i thought might as well check my battery. damian went above and beyond by not only checking my battery once but a couple times to make sure it was holding a charge, turns out it wasn't. he replaced it and printed out what was wrong with my car (it needed coolant). thanks damian! i will always go back here!!"
417,positive,"i had a great experience when i bought my car last year.  the salesman was friendly and helpful (as he should be when i spend that kind of dough on a car).  i was smart enough to get my trade in appraised by car max first, before going to the audi dealership.  since they know that car max will honor that value for 7 days, audi had to honor it as well, if they wanted to sell me a car.  they ended up giving me a little extra.  let me say that, thank goodness the remainder of the warranty was included in the price, because i ended up having some major issues with the car (a 2008 a4 turbo) about 3 months after i bought it.

i took the car into the service department, and they were unable to find anything wrong with it.  they suggested i just get the oil changed, which i did.  after a weekend road trip to san diego, the car was barely running, so i had to take it back in.  nancy and brett were both really helpful, and i understand that the situation was not their fault.  they did all they could do.  however, the mechanics could not figure out what was causing the issue.  they started out by replacing some fuel pumps.  that didn't solve the problem.  then they replaced the transmission.  still no luck.  finally, they brought in a specialist from germany and ended up replacing the entire engine.  that fixed it, but they had my car for over a month.  luckily, i was cruising around in a sweet loaner 2012 q5 while they had my car.  it is just a bit disappointing that i had such major issues with a car i purchased just a few months prior.  they still never figured out what the problem was, but it is all fixed.  recently, i have replaced my battery and scheduled some maintenance (for 35k miles), and brice, who is the service manager, has been awesome.  the service department is very busy (can't help but think it's because they might sell lemons like they did to me, but whatever), so if you will require a loaner car, you need to make advance arrangements.

it may sound strange, but i work for a luxury hotel, and verbiage is very important to us.  that being said, i really think that the receptionists need to work on their verbiage.  sometimes when i call, i feel like they are bothered by having to assist me. they aren't always so friendly, which is unfortunate for the cost of the product they are selling.

service on audis is very expensive in general.  if you are considering buying one of these vehicles, i would suggest the audi care package - otherwise you will be paying an arm and a leg anytime your car requires an oil change or scheduled maintenance.  i wish that i would have bought this option, but it was not offered to me when i purchased my car.

overall, i think that you get personalized service (which is expected), and they do not just treat you like a ""number.""  i can't imagine buying anything other than an audi in the future, even though i may not have had the best experience this time around."
418,positive,"my truck is at 100k miles and has never broke down.  my window motor recently died in two different windows, two separate months, i figured 100k miles is time for a checkup. they looked my car up and down, they let me know what needs to be replaced and what can wait. turns out i needed shocks and hub bearings.  some other parts were worn but not warranting replacement yet.  so i had them fix it, had my truck back the same day, now i go to them for oil changes too because honest mechanics are hard to find, but once you find one you will never go anywhere else. 

on a side note, a friend of mine thought she had a bad transmission, she brought her car here, turns out it was just a timing issue. so instead of forking out over 1000 bucks for a new transmission she ended up with a bill for around 50 dollars in labor. 

that being said, this place values the relationship they build with the community over the almighty dollar.

that being said, i'll be back for oil changes and preventive maintenance on my current car, my wife's current car and every other car we buy in the future. because good honest mechanics are hard to come by."
419,positive,"i like tim walter so much, i almost wish my car would break down so i would have an excuse to see him. 

he is super honest, explains everything, gets the cheapest appropriate parts he can, and isn't the least bit condescending. picture the kindest surgeon you can; tim walter is the same, just for cars instead. 

also, the man has a great memory. he *still* makes fun of me for that coke can i had strapped to my muffler 7 years ago."
420,positive,"my oil change and transmission drain/fill turnout to be cheaper then independent shop, and i got a free carwash and vacuum!  i'll be back!"
421,positive,"found the truck online and called them on labor day. went and saw the truck the next day. met them and loved how down to earth, honest and welcoming all of them were, especially kathleen. walked out with a 15 day/500 mile warranty on transmission and engine. day 7, mile 410, transmission clutch was slipping. called them up, and true to their word they got me into a transmission shop and had the clutch replaced under their warranty. a persons word goes a long way with me and they honored theirs. i will definitely recommend anyone i know to buy from them and will check them out first when it's time to buy my wife a new car."
422,positive,"the manager and mechanics are kind, honest people who provide phenomenal service. i went in to have my muffler and center pipe replaced due to rusting issues. 

they saved me $600 over the dealership service quote, had the required parts delivered within the hour, and finished the maintenance itself in about an hour.  

i felt entirely comfortable trusting my car to them, and plan to have all of my future servicing done here."
423,positive,"being a huge car guy, i thought i would try out scottsdale muffler.  called, made an appointment to get a muffler that i bought installed on my jaguar s type r.  i showed up on time, and in a few minutes they took my car around.  then they called me out to show me that it wouldn't fit.  i really liked that, because rather than give me some story, they showed me the issue and explained it thoroughly.

fast forward a few weeks.  i buy the correct muffler, make an appointment, show up, and they take the car around on time.  a few minutes later i hear them working on the car.  in an hour, they were done.  top notch welding, no bs, and they didn't mine working on my luxury car, all while respecting my time and busy schedule.  very reasonable labor rate too.

i will be back in the future and highly recommended!!!"
424,positive,"i've been in for two services now, and these guys are top notch!  my 40k transmission service was about half the price the dealer wanted and also half the price of my former mechanic!  the price i was quoted on the phone with just the general inquiry was the same price i was quoted once i arrived, and that was the final price.  there was no upselling like you typically get with some mechanics.  

the reception area is neat and clean and modern, with usb and a place to plug in your laptop.  very important to me, because i like to wait for my car and work on my laptop.  i was offered coffee/water/soda and taken back to the keurig for fresh coffee.  

let me say, i dread using public bathrooms, but they have separate men's and women's restrooms, and it was spotless!  the atmosphere is very family-like.  eddie and moe are super nice guys who seem to really like what they do, and they answered all of my questions thoroughly.  i like the fact that they have the two dogs too!

another thing that pleasantly surprised me is a mechanic who is actually intuitive and reset the service alert without me mentioning it.  it appeared in between my transmission service and subsequent oil change.  i forgot to ask them if they could reset that.  lo and behold, i get in the car...no annoying service alert!  it's something small but shows me that they are observant to more than just the service at hand and are looking at the big picture.

i will be coming back here for anything i need in the future for my vw gli!  definitely recommend cars!"
425,positive,"i shopped around a bit for the check engine light i had on that was related to an evap system leak.  the other shop wanted $96 for the diagnostic alone. pep boys charged me $45 for the diagnostic and when they'd found the issue they called me up and asked if i wanted it repaired.  since i did get it repaired they rolled that $45 charge into the payment for the repair.  they gave me a quote over the phone and when i went to pick up the vehicle the actual charge was $4 less.  its not a whole lot of a difference, but at least it was in my favor.

i found the customer service here to be especially good.  all of the staff was very friendly.  there was sometimes a wait for service but nothing out of the ordinary for an auto parts store or an auto service shop."
426,positive,purrfect auto has exceeded my expectations! truly standing by their warranty with ace mechanics this place receives my most sincere recommendations. i had a check engine light that was very difficult to figure out but purrfect auto worked to find the problem and made sure the issue was resolved. thank you purrfect auto!
427,positive,"i brought my van to scottsdale muffler & automotive at the recommendation of my very knowledgeable mechanic; he knows who is good  and who isn't!

i talked to chris on the phone and told him my mechanic was recommending a catalytic converter for my van to help me pass the state emissions inspection. he asked me a couple of questions and let me know that they could have my van done in about 45 minutes and quoted me a price, which was less than half of any other shops i contacted!

however, i like to do as much of my own vehicle maintenance as i can, so i looked into what it would take to replace my own catalytic converter. turns out, i would actually have to spend about $100 more to do the work myself!!!

i quickly called and set up an appointment!

while waiting in the lobby, the mechanic working on my van came in and said he needed to show me something (oh no, here we go!).

he showed me that my muffler had a pretty large crack in it. he offered to replace the muffler with a new one for $115, which i thought was a very fair price for my vehicle. i asked if the crack was causing any performance problems and he said no. i then asked if the crack could be welded and if the muffler would work ok with this fix. he said yes, and offered to do this repair for only $30! 

here's the really cool thing: he could have easily told me that my performance would suffer if i didn't buy a new muffler. and i would have believed him. i know quite a bit about cars, but not everything. i was ready to go ahead with the new muffler if he said i needed it. but he was honest and let me know that a simple and inexpensive weld would take care of things.

as a small business owner myself, i really appreciate it when other businesses treat me well. i am happy to say that the folks over at scottsdale muffler & automotive will have all of my future business!"
428,positive,we had a outstanding experience with zain engineer the service manager. he went above and beyond to help us concerning warranty issues and transmission issues. he was extremely professional and helped to guide us with any questions we had. highly recommend talking to zain for any service issues you have at  nissan autonation.
429,positive,"scott and his crew have been beyond helpful to me during the last 9 months that i have used them.  whether it is helping me find the right battery for my truck or doing a bumper to bumper inspection of a used car i bought they have always been accommodating and able to fit me in whether it's a scheduled appointment or an emergency.

recently they were able to change out the 12v battery on my hybrid after i picked it up from next door and getting accident damage repaired.  during the course of the repair the battery died and they were able to get me in and help me change it out.  normally i would do it myself but i was 7 months pregnant, recently in an accident, and couldn't lift the battery.  they even checked my check engine light for me but unfortunately it spit out some weird code even they couldn't figure out.

all in all whitey's has been around since before i was born and has continues to be at the top of their game.  i would highly recommend them to anyone in the area.  i don't mind driving from central phoenix to have someone i trust work on my car."
430,positive,awesome experience. they got me in right away on a saturday and gave me a fair price for a new muffler. the only place i'll go for exhaust work.
431,positive,"i dropped of my audi a3 for 35k service, 2 days prior a check engine light came on which i paid no attention to. the drop off was smooth everyone at the dealership was friendly, there were people ahead of me but didn't wait long at all. then the shuttle service took me to work. i think 2-3 hours later i got a call from my service advisor saying that the check engine light was on and it was caused by a high pressure fuel pump that was about to fail. the good news was warranty covers all the parts/labor needed, the bad news the part was not available and will come in the following day. i was little disappointed about that since i needed a vehicle to get around, which they offered me a loaner vehicle, i was able to get back to the dealership get my loaner car without any hassle. got my car the following day, the service advisor explained everything that was done to the car, what parts may potentially need replacing. 

i just want to say what a great service audi of henderson provides. audi makes quality products already but part of great car ownership and brand loyalty is the quality and honesty of the brands ""service departments"". service departments are who customers deal with the most post purchase. the car buying process takes about 5-6hrs or so and the relationship between the sales person and buyer may continue or end with no consequence, but after buying a car you need to have a good honest, quality service department for its up keep for years to come. i really think that this is one of the most important aspects of car ownership. i hope audi of henderson keep their high quality standards in customer/car care. audi of america keep setting high standards for your car dealership/service departments, keep policing those that don't perform well."
432,positive,"this has got to be the most honest mechanic i have ever been to.  not only is it convenient (right at the corner of bloor and bathurst, with key drop option available), but they are ridiculously honest i'm actually in disbelief as i type this review.  the people who work there are super friendly too, they never make you feel stupid and as a woman with a truck i'm weary people will take advantage of me or talk down to me, but that never happens here.  the customer service is amazing and the people make you feel like family.   my experiences here have been as follows:

- first time i came here was because i felt like my alignment was off the night before a trip to montreal - i needed to get the alignment and hopefully an oil change done first thing on a friday morning cuz i had to be on the road to mtl. by noon.  i used to go to canadian tire but they were unable to accommodate me for a morning appointment the next day because they said it takes several hours to do an alignment.  feeling more desperate,  i called midas as a last resort because i (wrongly) ass-u-med they'd be kinda expensive - but it turns out their cost for an alignment was actually cheaper than canadian tire and they were able to see me first thing the next morning!  on top of that, their website has coupons for $ off any work and oil change deals so #protip: make sure to check out the midas website and grab your coupons before you go.  i dropped the truck off at 9am and by 10am i got a phone call from them - ""truck is ready to be picked up, your alignment was fine, we have a printout of the specs to show you, so we didn't need to do the work after all, we did do the oil change, come on down and get your truck!""   my jaw literally dropped to the floor.  a mechanic telling me the work wasn't necessary, not charging me a dime, in the heart of downtown toronto?  this is unheard of.  needless to say, i made it on the road in time, confident with my alignment, with the extra $ i had set aside to spend on the alignment still in my pocket to splurge on my trip!  not only that, they did an entire vehicle inspection checkup/spec/printout sheet to show me free of charge when i went to pick up my truck.  midas won me over as a customer right then and there. canadian tire who? lol 

-second time i came here was cuz my muffler was making a rattling noise on acceleration. i got my brother to help me isolate the noise before calling the garage so we knew that it was coming from the exhaust system.   i was reluctant to bring my truck in anywhere cuz i was afraid of how much even just a diagnostic/estimate would cost me.  it turns out midas at bloor/bathurst does the inspection and estimates for free!!!  brought my vehicle in before work, and by 11am they were on the phone with me to let me know the ""damage"" - turns out it was just a loose clip.  they replaced it for free.  they told me that the vehicle was fixed and ready to be picked up, and everything looks great and i owe them nothing.  i was sitting here prepared to spend in the ballpark of $1000 for repairs and it turns out i owe $0.00.  if i could have hugged the guy through the phone i would have. 

just also note it seems like i'm bringing my vehicle for all these unnecessary repairs - no.  i am not a rich woman so when i bring my truck to the garage it's cuz i'm trying to avoid more costly repairs in the future (i.e. having to buy new tires for driving w/ the alignment off for too long, and not just ignoring a noisy exhaust/muffler issue).  i'm not some nitpicky person when it comes to my truck - it's got lots of untreated cosmetic damage from when my mom backed into me (lol) and a crack along the bottom windshield from a pebble hitting the windshield during a bad storm -  but i do like to address preventable driveability issues before they get worse. this mechanic is so honest it's actually ridiculous and they are so friendly and nice i feel like finding them was akin to having a horseshoe up my a$$. prices are entirely reasonable - cheaper than canadian tire and service is way more personalized -  please go to this garage, they are amazing!!!!"
433,positive,"i took my 2014 nissan altima here for the first time after the car had a complete transmission failure after a drive from orange county.  this was an unexpected issue as the car is relatively new and has low miles. i was in vegas on vacation, not to have the transmission replaced. however, i cannot say enough good things about auto nation nissan, specifically the service associate mike,100% professional.  his professionalism and service is top notch.  he was very empathetic to my situation and reassured me that the car was under warranty and reassured me that it would be fixed expeditiously. i am 100% pleased with my service experience here and appreciate mike for keeping me up to date on the details and for going above and beyond the call of duty. thank you mike i hope the dealership realizes you are an asset to the team."
434,positive,"i just cant say enough about these guys.  i took my car in yesterday for an oil change and my check engine light was also on.  they changed my oil no problem and my engine light was on because i needed a new gas cap.  i was soo relieved.  these guys are totally honest and reliable.  these are the kind of guys that i know if and when i need them to do a big job, i'm not going to have to call around to price the job with other competitors, these guys are the best!  my boss has been using them for years and that is how i found out about them.  i am divorced so i don't have anyone to work on my jeep but now i have these guys.  they can never close up shop because i don't know what i will do.  i don't want to go to anyone else.  they also put on my registration sticker on my plate because i didn't have the tool to get off the license plate cover.  they are just good guys.  thank you al!"
435,positive,"this is the second vehicle that i have taken to chris at scottsdale muffler, and they did a spectacular job and my catalytic converter for my diesel passed with flying colors. thanks again guys"
436,positive,"i've been coming here for the past few years and its always a good experience. they are compassionate and kind, always looking for the best way to help. i'm very sensitive to being talked down to and have never felt disrespected here. they've always taken the time to explain the work to me. recently took my car in for a check engine and a broken muffler pipe. they fixed my check engine light issue but they could only replace my muffler and not fix it. instead of just quoting me the price, they directed me to someone who could fix my issue (instead of replacing) it for half the cost. they also didn't tell me what to do but gave me all my options. always will take my car here."
437,positive,"i was referred to ultimate collision through the insurance company of the person who rear-ended me so i was hoping to get my car repaired quickly and wasn't expecting a lot of personal attention.  despite the fact that i wasn't paying for the repair, dennis and the rest of the team provided a great experience. the repair timeline was clearly explained and i was constantly kept in the loop on the progress. dennis was also nice enough to inspect and buff out an existing scrape i had (not related to the accident) at no charge. my car was repaired quickly and looks great. i highly recommend dennis and team and will definitely look them up the next time i'm in need of a body shop."
438,positive,"i had an excellent experience with all three of my visits to choice transmission. dennis completed 3 projects for my on my old truck, and none of them were related to transmission work. they really are a complete automotive shop. i highly recommend their services."
439,positive,i had an brake booster issue with my edge.  i contacted santan and they said they couldn't get me in for at least a week.  i called them again later that day and spoke with jesus.  jesus insisted i bring it in the next morning and assured me he would get the edge in that day.  he agreed that there is no reason i should have to wait so long for a serious brake issue.  i met jesus (with the beard) that next morning.  this guy was professional and kept me updated through the process (4 phone calls) also they found out there was another issues with my vehicle due to a check engine light being on.  the booster was covered on an extended warranty and the additional work was at a very reasonable cost.  i just wanted my vehicle to be handed back to me the way it was prior to the mechanical issues.  i am so please with the work done and as well as the experience i had dealing with this dealership. more importantly i'm happy that jesus took the time to listen to my concerns and worked to resolve them.  this is how all customers should be treated.  thanks again to jesus and the santan team for all your hard work.  you have earned my business.
440,positive,"i've been looking for a good shop to service my truck that i use for my pool maintenance company. i bought it about 10 months ago and it's been a challenge finding a shop that really looks over everything when you get the oil change. last time i got the oil change at a shop i won't mention i asked them to please look over everything because the truck is new to me and i want to keep it running and do any necessary maintenance to prevent issues down the road. came back to pick it up and asked the tec how it all looked and he said great ! and nothing was needed. i was super happy because we're pretty tight on money like most people and if i didn't have to spend any more it was a good day ! leaving the shop i noticed the low pressure light for the tires was on so i stopped by the tire shop  that was on the corner and i had a nail in 2 of my tires. so needless to say they didn't really check over everything. 
so speed up to this week, it was time for a oil change and noticed my brakes where sounding really bad so i knew i needed to get it in soon. every time i came to a stop the sound got worse and worse so now i'm afraid to drive the truck so i parked it. i talked to my wife who is the finance manager at our house about what was going on and we weren't in a position to drop a grand on breaks and rotors plus a oil change so she had to figure out something because this is my tuck i make a living with. she noticed that sears had a auto center down the road and we have a sears credit card so we took that as a sign. i brought my 2007 chevy 2500 truck into the shop and as soon as i walked in the door i was greeted by a nice guy that asked me what he could help with. i explained that i needed a oil change and my brakes where sounding bad so if they could check that out as well and if they could just do a general inspection on the truck for any other issues. by this time a couple of the guys from the back came out and asked me some more questions about what i was hearing do they could trouble shoot the problems better. i wish i had the young man's name that diagnosed my truck because he was super courteous and very professional. we left the truck there to go eat dinner and within two hours received a phone call from the shop explaining the issues that needed to be completed on the truck. they explained that the truck needed rear pads and rotors the differential fluid needed to be changed and the transmission fluid needed to be flushed. they gave me the pricing on all those repairs and they were actually cheaper then two other shops that i called just for the brakes. this was the best experience i've ever had at any auto shop and will highly recommend sears at superstition springs to all of my customers friends and family. i really hope that sears reads these reviews and they find out the name of the young man that did the work on my truck and give him a raise he definitely has a bright future in the auto industry and he turned me into a sears auto center customer for life."
441,positive,"service advisor ricky clark was the best. we had a check engine light for throttle body on the sentra. ricky initially quoted us the same price as other dealers but went above and beyond to win our business. ricky was able to find other avenues and help reduce the price of a replacement throttle body for our sentra. after service was completed and time of customer pick up, ricky was still able yo reduce overall price with other discounts! vehicle works flawlessly now and service advisor kept working with customer with pricing! excellent service department and advisor! thanks you again"
442,positive,"so my paid off kia sedona started clicking and the check engine light came on right after a trip to ""jiffy lube"" i suspected it was bad news but i didnt anticipate how bad the news would be. i checked google maps because i saw that all foreign and domestic auto service was in my neighborhood and they just did some renovations to make the place look great. the reviews were what i needed to see. ive been to other west park places and well. i had new brakes that squealed too at low speed. anyhow took it to all foreign and domestic. it turns out my engine tick was a bad bearing on a piston rod. there is something comforting about someone delivering bad news with an italian accent. this was on a wednesday. he quoted me a price for a used engine that was about the same low miles as mine. i did the math on a new car or a lightly used car and decided id fix the engine.  he told me it would be there on friday and the job would be done late tuesday. on friday night he called me to come down to see the new engine in the frame getting ready to be installed. i went up of course. totally amazing seeing this major surgery on the car. on monday at around 5pm i got a call ""your car is ready to pick up"" (yes, that was a day early) so they did a full engine swap out in two days. i waited two days where i have driven 300 miles to write a review but things are working perfectly. the engine is so quiet i cant even hear it. also the rumbling i heard in my suspension was some heat shield (so that is silent and was not a huge suspension fix) also my brake job squeal was diagnosed as cheap brakepads and that was fixed as well. my car is back, it is in perfect shape and was well taken care of by all foreign and domestic. oh yes and the quoted price in the beginning was spot on at the end. no surprises and what i consider a very reasonable price for basically giving my whole car a major overhaul."
443,positive,"the crew at jiffy lube definitely saved the day! in this case it was moving day!
my room mate and i just barely made it to jiffy lube in the hopes that they could fill our transmission fluid since it had been draining fast for some reason or another. not only did they offer to fill it for us for free either way, but when they saw how bad the leak was, not only did they fill our transmission, but they gave us two spare jugs of transmission fluid so that we could make it home. not only that, but they also gave us directions to take the safer back roads across town, considering the condition of our car.  saying that they saved the day is putting it lightly. i will always recommend the crew at jiffy lube. thanks a bunch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
444,positive,"good place with quality work. they squeezed me in on a saturday early afternoon with no appointment, welded up a muffler and got me back on the road in under 30 minutes. ill be going back to get our jeep's exhaust done."
445,positive,this is a nice local shop. they got our car in quickly when it had a check engine light. they determined it just needed an oil change. they got the job done quick and their prices are fair. they even gave my daughter a lollipop when we went to pick it up.
446,positive,"i will not go anywhere else now that i've been here!!! what else can i say about these guys but their shop is one of a kind. fast, efficient, friendly, helpful, and definitely are not there to rip off their customers.

i had some work done by a previous mechanic at another shop and was having some check engine light issues after the work was performed. looked these guys up on yelp and thought i'd give them a try after seeing the great reviews. 

spoke with tamra who was extremely nice and got me in as soon as she could. when i first got there i was greeted by the owner phil. i let him know of my problem and he ran a free diagnostics check (which by the way i've never heard of any shop doing). after some searching he found out that my spark plug wires were bad, all of which i was told by the pre-mentioned previous mechanic were replaced. he gave me an absolutely fair estimate but knowing a little bit about cars i decided to change them myself. he told me good luck and sent me on my way, did not try and upsell anything to me (which as you know with auto shops is quite rare). upon replacing the spark plug wires, one of them was so bad it fell apart when tugging on it. needless to say got those replaced but the check engine light issue still remained. called up litchfield auto and again tamra squeezed me in asap. 

got there the second time and phil and his mechanics again started a free diagnostics on the car, mind you they closed at 6pm and i showed up about 4pm. upon further inspection, he told me that the spark plug wires were crossed and fixed them, handed me my keys, again at no charge and told me have a great day. i couldn't believe the great service at this point so i myself asked him to charge me a labor fee for these guys working on my car for hours between both of the days i took it there. 

long story short these guys are excellent. i have never been to a shop that is this clean and that is actually concerned about retaining loyal customers and not just how much money they can squeeze out of you. like i said before i know a little bit about cars and phil and his staff are one of a kind. he took the time to talk with me about the issues and explain how things work with the car so we could be on the same page and never did i once feel like he was out to get me.

i will definitely recommend this shop to anyone i know and will go there for all my auto needs.

thanks again guys for being there for the customer!!!!"
447,positive,"i came here for a state safety inspection. they were able to fit me in the same day without an appointment, which was nice because i was working from home with a cold that day, so it was convenient.

the shop office is a little dated with floor to ceiling wood paneling - but in some weird way, i really liked it. all over were posted old photographs of family, friends, etc, and i could tell there were a lot of memories and history in this place.

the inspection went fine, they didn't try to sell anything unnecessary to me, and i was given the same price i was told. unfortunately, no experience actually getting my car repaired here, but based on this experience, i'd be happy to give them a try."
448,positive,"there is new owner. very honest.   i sat waiting for my oil change.  the 2 people that were waiting both had issues with there cars.  one was an ac compressor that was starting to go and another was a muffler issues.  they filled the guys ac with freon for free and said he could probably make to the cooler months and deal with it later.  the muffler guy he said was fine for emissions and it was only cosmetic noise issue and see him when it starts to bother him.

i got my simple oil change as usually.  no air filter upsell like in those other places.

new owner is doing a great job."
449,positive,"these guys just earned my business today. drove in because my check engine light was on they did a quick check on my vehicle and it was only a ""gas cap"" issue.. no charge and i was on the road in less than 15 minutes!! thank you!"
450,positive,"if you want honesty, transparency, and expertise bundled up with a tiny bow on top, whitey's is your new spot.  

it sucks getting your car fixed.  it sucks even more to have to find someone you can trust.  they live up to their reputation big time.  it's hard to not give them a review when you leave so here i am.

my throw out bearing on my 2013 mazda 3 went out and i had no clue what it was.  tarrance hopped in the car and knew the problem within a second of starting it.

he kept me in the loop the whole time and gave it to me straight when he uncovered the real problems inside the transmission.  it could've been doctored up the wrong way easily, but he took his time and made sure everything was done correctly.  he told me what was going on and in the end it was my choice how i wanted to go about it.  

my car shifts smooth as butter now.  thank you tarrance and everyone at whitey's!"
451,positive,i have taken two cars here for transmission repair and both times was very happy with the price and repair.  i called them for a referral for a non-transmission problem and they said i could bring my car by their shop as they did expanded work beyond just transmissions.  they resolved problems two other shops overcharged for and did not fix.  very honest guys here!
452,positive,"we were thrilled with the work at red mountain collision.  dealt with jessica and bob and both were a pleasure.  jessica kept us well informed throughout the process.  bob wrote the original estimate and with the exception of my muffler which also had to be replaced due to the accident, the estimate was spot on.  
i was able to schedule my repairs while i was out of town.  when the car was going to take an additional 2 days jessica had the rental car all set up for me first thing on the morning of my return. 
not only does my car look great, the day i picked it up not only was it detailed on the outside it was meticulously detailed on the inside. i had told my husband it didn't look that good on the inside the day we picked it up from the dealership.  
do yourself a favor if you need body work done, go straight to red mountain collision."
453,positive,"i cannot say enough good things about my experience at national transmission. i had brought my bmw to the dealership, who told me that i needed a new transmission and that this would cost me $7300. wanting a second opinion, i take my car to brock. he determined that it was a computer/sensor issue, not a transmission problem. he explained the problem to me in detail. following up with bmw, i took it up to the shop foreman, who later admitted that they were wrong. brock went above and beyond to recommend a better place to take my bmw to get this issue fixed and even set up an appointment. thanks brock!"
454,positive,"was treated like a king when i went into service for a check up and got a very honest answers and they got me out of there quickly. i got a transmission update and a steering check and left satisfied! the whole service crew seemed like really nice people, the guy that helped me is named josh and he did a great job! i'll definitely be back and recommend infiniti on camelback and plus on top of that they gave my car a free wash couldn't be much happier!service department rocks!"
455,positive,"there are blessings in this world that come in various shapes and sizes.  for my friend, kathy n., it came in the way of ralph and frank at pro collision center.  without going into too much detail, kathy got into an accident and had to get the car fixed.  everybody's got problems, so i won't go into a sob story of kathy's particular hardships, but she was admitted to the hospital via the er with chest pain.  with financial constraints, medical issues, and as a struggling newly-divorced, single mom, she's had much to contend with.  the day of her hospital release--today, in fact, she rushed to return the car insurance rental and to retrieve her car at pcc.  with the stress and problems that my girlfriend was facing, (i believe) it was ralph that came in his invisible superhero cape to facilitate the return of her vehicle and the settling of her insurance case.  he knows what he did, and god bless him for it.  trust me, word of mouth goes far.  ralph went above and beyond normal customer service.  

go to these guys!!!!  there's a certain basic knowledge of cars that all auto repair places will have, but will they be fair with you?  will they work with you?  will they take care of you?   a good, fair, and honest woman went in looking to settle her insurance claim and get her car repaired.  she could have easily been taken advantage of, and nobody at pcc needed to invest themselves the way ralph/frank did in her.  they didn't owe kathy that at all; they invested themselves in her because they cared.  a good deed is never forgotten, and please consider this anecdote as you all peruse through yelp reviews on where to go for your auto repair needs.

as a close girlfriend to kathy, all i could do was cry and join in her blessings for the exceptional service rendered and peace of mind given to my dear friend.  of course, i'm writing this review second-hand, because kathy doesn't have the access to do so, and i would never doubt her word.  please don't doubt it either.

may this review serve as good karma for this place of business."
456,positive,"i wanted a fuel-friendly car and selected a cross-over type car. very pleased. mark definitely gets his role...no pressure and lots of laid back confidence. i would have preferred a manual transmission, but i'm more than pleased​ with my purchase."
457,positive,this place answered the phone on new years eve at night when nobody else did.  on top of that they are honest and could have easily told me i needed a new transmission but after a quick look all i needed was an axle.  i left my car with them for a week because i live in phoenix and i was anxious about leaving my car in a different city but their clear communication with me made it easy. they are trustworthy. they even stayed up late when i picked up the car because i flew in from phoenix at 11pm.  all of that and they didn't even charge extra even though it was nye and they are mobile.  thanks again for being there.
458,positive,"we travel full time in our rv and tow our older jeep liberty.  our previous neighborhood mechanic recommended we go to a jeep dealer to get our transmission serviced and we decided, since we were in death valley are that las vegas was close.  we originally called a different dealer to be told it would be a week before they could get us in.  we called chapman based upon other reviews.  we were not disappointed. they gave us 3 options for times.  we chose one then the day before they called to confirm.  we asked directions which she provided.  
we arrived early and were immediately greeted by anthony, our service advisor who listened patiently as we outlined our needs and issues.  he gave us a price and estimated time frame.  offered us a place to sit with wifi.  it all worked out as we hoped.  repairs made, vehicle transmission serviced and lof performed.  we left very happy and would go again."
459,positive,"matt was a pleasure to work with for a muffler repair on a work van.
got me in quick. price was outstanding. i will take all muffler repairs for my fleet to this location.
thank you for the outstanding service."
460,positive,"i had taken my 2001 ford f 250 into dave's a few months ago to find an oil leak that once i pulled into their driveway decided to stop leaking. dave's crew gave it their all but couldn't find it and told me to keep an eye on it and let them know if it came back. well when the leak came back so did i !! and they found it this time. it wasn't a ""cheap"" repair but due to the complexity of the leak and the work involved in doing the repair i can say ""i'm a happy customer!!"" 
i have now passed dave's name on to my mother who is in need of transmission service and who i'm sure will test his patience but i know in my heart she will be well cared for. 
thank you dave!! and i will send you a few more family members if you think you can deal with them :0)"
461,positive,"big jim's is great. i took my car there for a transmission repair last year (after the guy at the dealership tried to be super sketchy and offered to do an under-the-table deal where he wanted to get a used transmission off the internet to replace mine) and it's still working great, plus it's under a 2 year warranty. the best part was that jim took out a big transmission book, flipped to the page with my model of car, and showed me the exact parts that were broken. a nice change from most mechanics that list off a bunch of mumbo-jumbo technical terms with no real explanation. i really appreciated the simplified explanation of what was broken on my car. the repair was expensive, but... transmission repairs are expensive.  then a few days ago i took my car to jim for a brakes repair, after going to a different mechanic (i had wrongly assumed jim only did transmissions) that quoted me a ridiculous price and was clearly trying to rip me off. jim quoted me a price $300 less than the other place and explained that the other place was going overboard, and my car simply needed new brake pads & discs. he finished the repair very quickly and so far everything is working great with my brakes. overall jim seems like an honest guy who is great at explaining why your car needs certain repairs... and he doesn't try to rip you off with unnecessary repairs."
462,positive,"after another visit to calanni's, i was impressed once again. firestone had charged over $800 for a piston servo seal bore fix that wasn't even done and wasn't even done properly as well as leaving transmission lines leaking after befing towed to a transmission shop they use!! (a small claims against firestone is being filed). they made promises that weren't kept with a rental car and had an attitude that a franchise controlled the market. charlie calanni and his team came to the rescue for the best price once again. i don't trust anyone else besides calanni""s complete auto repair service, period! you know what you are getting when you go to calanni's, quality, safety, price, knowledge and trustworthiness. if you are new to lakewood or a well-rooted lakewood resident, trust your vehicle to calanni's. 

don't believe the negative reviews that people don't show their faces. if they actually had an argument they'd show their faces."
463,positive,"this review is for the service dept - service from karla g. i have had terrible experience with this dealership in the sales department, and would never recommend buying a car from here. 

i recently price shopped transmission fluid exchange for my 2006 honda element, and i was surprised that the dealer was competitively priced with independent shops. concerned about the shops using the wrong fluid type or similar transmission issues, and that i had two outstanding recall items, i took my vehicle to honda west with an appointment. the service from karla was great, informative, and spot on. my car was serviced and completed prior to my estimated completion times. 

my only concern that i need to address is that they advertise on their signage when you pull up $39 synthetic oil change, but i noticed my service tag was for 3k miles with standard oil."
464,positive,"my entire exhaust pipe, from my muffler back to my catalytic converter, was missing.  the screw things (flanges?) had rusted at both ends as well! 

i couldn't afford a whole new exhaust system, at $1,500!

hot rod scott was able to replace the portion of the pipe that was missing, and weld it at either end directly, without having to replace the flanges (assuming that's the correct term!) for $300....score!

the price was great and it should last me 5 years, since i don't drive that much.

they were very quick too.  less than an hour!

they also do custom and performance muffler systems, and a lot of repair shops send clients here for exhaust and muffler work!

i highly recommend these guys!  thanks for saving me $1,200!  seriously."
465,positive,"this is a brand new auto repair shop, i think it used to be called something else, but it's brand new owners and the staff here is wonderful!!

we first got an oil change here a few months ago - $11.99 for your basic oil. wow.

we came back to get our brakes done. i had received a quote from pep boys for $500 which included brake pads and new rotors for the back. here they did it all for $300 and threw in an oil change with the synthetic oil. bargain! and it only took an hour for everything.

we also have a check engine light on for a problem with one of the engine fans. they first ran a full diagnostic which is $49.99, free if you do the repair there. they were able to get the check engine light to come off, but in a re-cycle of the car's engine the light came back on; they felt so bad they didn't actually end up charging us for the diagnostic after all. they even called around to junk yards to try to find us a used part, but no luck. we are going to have to have the entire fan replaced, but we'll definitely be doing it here. the staff is so nice, they are honest and have the best pricing in town. i give them 5 stars all the way!"
466,positive,"chris (service) was very nice. after driving my 2012 nissan altima from socal it overheated and caused major problems with the transmission. i called nissan praying they could help me since my car was still under warranty (friday) i spoke with chris who was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. they processed me in and out in 20 min maybe less, giving me a rental until they could figure out the problem. he called me to let me know they had to replace my transmission. i am really grateful they were able to do all of this in 24 hrs and the total level of service and professionalism from their staff. good job!!!"
467,positive,"cars did work on our jetta in the past and everything always went smoothly. more recently they did a quick repair (computer for the transmission) on our porsche 911. the car wouldn't go into gear right after we had it detailed for sale. someone was coming to look at it in a few days which put us in a bind. cars diagnosed the problem, ordered the part, made the fix and got us up and running in time for the car inspection. we remain friends with buyer and he has had zero problems after the fact.

we will take our bmw m3 (see the german trend?) there when it needs work...although we hope that doesn't happen soon."
468,positive,"just like everyone else, i was drawn to this place because of their cheap prices. it took me a while to find the place because apple maps directed me to fort apace and peace way. i called the shop and marlene has been very helpful in giving me the exact location (behind arby's on northeast side of fort apache and tropicana). 

after getting my car checked, it turns out i needed more than just an oil change to get done. chris took the time to explain what needs to be done with my car (transmission fluid, power steering fluid and coolant flush). due to those, my oil change which is supposed to be $25 (5w20) came out free. they also offer free oil change or 10% off when you write a yelp review and it's good for use that same day :) 

even though i came out paying for more than i was expecting, i am satisfied with the customer service, the prices and the short wait time. i definitely recommend this place and i am coming back for my next oil change."
469,positive,wow! i will definitely be coming to this shop for all my car service needs! i drove around from shop to shop and everyone wanted to charge me $50-$100 to see why my check engine light was on after describing to them what was happening with my car. i went to usa and spent 10 seconds describing it to chris. he said without doubt it was just my battery and the best part is he didn't charge me to do a 5 second test to make sure he was correct! i couldn't believe everyone else wanted to charge me almost $100 to tell me i needed a new battery! chris and his staff were amazing and had 5 star service. it's a relief to be able to fix your car without the hassle! i will be back!!
470,positive,"these guys made my vw eos fun to drive again. had insane problems ( check engine light on, speedometer glitches, fuel tank showing empty when full, sudden gear shifts, etc.) which i had deducted were a problem with my abs module. as of the time of writing this review i've driven to cali and back. mostly drove around for the heck of it, about 14 hours total... drove right to california with my top down to ""test"" the work done. wow. i cannot describe how great these guys will treat you. eddie took me into garage and showed me all the gorgeous vehicles there. it was a cargasm. i was quoted an absurd price by the vw dealership and was almost ready to give up my beautiful little car. but, damn; these guys reminded me why i love my car so much. i would recommend going here if you love your car, and want to save money on the maintenance it deserves. i cannot wait to come back to get my dash system put in. i'm coming back eddie and moe!"
471,positive,"i just went to tim as my check engine light came on on my recently purchased 2005 toyota corolla. tim took a look at the code and told me what the problem was. reset it for me and told me to call him if it comes on again, all free of charge in just 5 minutes. that is why i like tim and will recommend him over anyone else, especially for old cars, the guy is very honest and will only recommend what is best for your car and your situation. not making you spend money when you don't need to."
472,positive,"i could not be more satisfied with pete's.  unfortunately, my '06 exploder had a serious transmission issue.  at first i thought that the needed repair was related to an insurance claim from a few months back.  while the needed repair / rebuild was not related to the previous claim, pete's transmission came highy recommended by the repair shop and my insurance company.  while i was given the opportunity to have my vehicle towed to my own shop of choice - i took the recommendation.  

the repair was completed as planned.  my telephone calls asking for updates and follow up of the repairs and improvements were addressed with details and patience as i have just about zero knowledge of transmissions!"
473,positive,"never had a problem with servicing my car here. been here about 6 times for numerous things. i had my check engine light on and i pulled it up to the service bay. the guy came out and hooked something up to it really quick and told me that it's just cheap gas that had a high oxygen level. they didn't charge me and i was in and out in 5 min. my oil changes had no issues and when my tranny went out, they fixed it the next day and paid for the towing.  the tranny was under warranty but it still nice that i didn't come out of pocket for a thing."
474,positive,there is a reason i'm loyal to vw. and this dealership solidifies my commitment to staying with vw. i drove up today from la and found that my check engine light went on. they were swamped but took me in to look over the car. within 2 hours i was out of there with enough fluids and understanding that the car would make it back to la ok. the professional way i was treated from start to finish was outstanding. jeffrey was the service manager who not only went out of his way to fit us in but also was a joy to deal with.
475,positive,"went in today for a smog, ended up getting a oil change, then got the transmission flushed of 121000 miles of nasty fluild. the 2 workers were so helpful, curious and i left with a smile because jimmy and alex being so helpful and caring about my issues with my car. i will be back the next and every time my car needs anything that they can take care of. i have never had a better experience having to do with my car and that means alot. thanks guys you are the best!!"
476,positive,"wow, what a difference from my awful experience at the last transmissions shop (check my reviews, be very aware of that awful shop). 

pete... was very helpful on the phone. stayed late so that i could drop off my bronco for a transmission rebuild. price is great! service great! this is how you treat customers... 
thanks again pete for raising the bar for quality transmission repairs in the valley!!!
j
update...feb 2016 great job. very happy.
update... apr 2018 still running great!"
477,positive,i took 2 different vehicles here toyota 4runner for rack and pinion and ford transit connect for transmission. both times these guys have taken care of me when others quoted high prices they always came in under and my first choice when taking a care in. hats off to national automotive for their honest and dependable work.
478,positive,"honesty is a rarity in this day and age so when i have dealings with an honest business  man/woman i wanna shout it from the rooftops.

in this case the honest man is brock, owner of national transmission on 14th street n.w. this man has bent over backwards and stayed past closing time to resolve our work truck issues.

he is as honest as they come and i consider him to be an expert in his field so if you have an issue with your transmission and don't want to pay a ton and have your tranny problems resolved brock would be the man to see.

quick note when looking at satellite pic i see the correct address being 343 - 14th street n.w. located beside the regal beagle pub."
479,positive,"was in from out of town and had a check engine light on my 2014 srx.  set up a service visit on the web site and received a call confirming a slightly different but acceptable service time.  good communications from jessica hartman, she was responsive and professional.  showed up at the dealer, was greeted promptly and courteously by roy who listened to my description of the issues then got the vehicle in right away.  i stayed in the comfortable customer waiting area for about 2 hours while the techs performed scheduled routine maintenance on the car and replaced a part in the intake of the engine that showed faulty on the diagnostics.  the car was cleaned inside and out which was really nice given the long trip it had just been subjected to.  i don't get to praise car dealers very often however the folks at earnhardt earned it with me.  i have no experience with their sales department but can certainly say the service department is top notch."
480,positive,"bastone was able to get my car into the shop the very day i was out looking to get my car repaired. carl, the man who assisted me, was very friendly, addressed all my concerns, and called me with an estimate before doing work (front end and alignment). compared to the horror stories you can read online, their prices are very reasonable. i picked up my car a few hours later and the steering is tight, dead-center, and hasn't felt this good to drive since i bought it. i will definitely be returning if any other problem with my car arises. nice work guys."
481,positive,"i just had some work done at this place on my town car - a 1997 silver lincoln wih 110000 miles on it.  the first place i went to said the transmission was bad and it would cost about $1,750 to fix it.  well i said forget that ill just drive it until it drops.  then i took it to econo lube / which is now a meineke - and the car runs amazing.  i had it fixed for $150 and was out the door in 1 hour.  these guys are great.  i took my other car in for an oil change.  excellent"
482,positive,stopped in while getting my car repaired very friendly place i had the number 4 combo taco and gordita combo.  very tasty.
483,positive,this place is my savior! nicest guys ever and they don't try to screw you. nissan dealership tried to charge me 740 for a new muffler! this place saved me 600 dollars and had it done in 30 minutes first thing in the morning. my car is perfect! very satisfied with the service
484,positive,"i have been her two times. the first time my check engine light came on, it scared me. i had a test done at auto zone to see why the light came on, they said it was something to do with my gas tank. i then took my car to lindsay auto and instead of charging me all this money to do test and look at everything, sean the owner said most likely i had a faulty gas cap, he wanted me to try it out for a day to see if the light would remain off, and it did! very thoughtful of him to think of the cost for others. 
       just a few weeks ago my boyfriend ran over something and it cut a large hole in his gas tank, they looked at his car right away and said the whole tank needed replaced. the car was a 2013 so we thought for sure it would be a lot because of the year, but sean then made the effort to find a used one and we didn't have to pay much, and didn't have to go through insurance.  i never had an auto service that treated me like a family member. i recommend this place to all my friends and family, very trust worthy."
485,positive,"all i can say is wow!!!! wish there were more stars i could give these guys! if you're looking for a place that you can trust to service your vehicle, look no further. we had been servicing our vehicles at towbin for years and recently had an issue with the transmission in my daughter's jeep patriot. we tried another dealer who basically told us nothing was wrong with the vehicle so we went back to our friends at towbin. 
jr and his team took exceptional care of my daughter. john, the shop foreman, drove the car with my daughter and of course it didn't make the noise we had been hearing. but instead of dismissing her like the other shop, he kept the car for the day and assured my daughter they would test the car a few more times to see if they could duplicate the problem. john was amazing and explained everything in detail. on one of the rides, he took the transmission tech who immediately diagnosed the problem.  eddie who helped my daughter with a loaner vehicle was awesome. communication was excellent, everyone promised they would contact her when they had an answer and she received a call before the end of the day.  parts were in stock, repairs were started immediately and she had her jeep back sooner than expected. kudos to jr and his team - quality service on your vehicle and exceptional customer service. i highly recommend towbin, they will take great care of you."
486,positive,"just moved to vegas and my check engine light came on.   stopped at the dealership with hopes they could see me.  lisa in the service dept. could not have been more helpful.    they got my car in to see what code it was showing and then set up an appointment to get it repaired.  i needed a new 02 sensor.   the service department was immaculate, courteous and professional.  the car has never been better.   everyone here was so helpful from getting me a water to showing me where the waiting area was.   they all seemed to want to help and work together."
487,positive,i had an issue with this dealership in the past but i decided to give them another chance after talking to corporate. i went in the other day because my check engine light was on. greg and his team were very helpful. they let me use a loaner car over the holiday weekend and resolved my dilemma.
488,positive,"i've been to cars on two separate occasions, once with my wife's 2009 volkswagen tiguan, and once with my 2016 chevrolet colorado.  my wife's tiguan's check engine light came on, and the mechanic shop i was visiting recommended cars to me since they specialized in german made vehicles.  after talking to one of the owners (eddie i believe his name was) on a saturday (i just showed up and he was doing paperwork on the weekend, but the shop isn't open for business) he advised i bring the car back on monday for a diagnostic.  after he diagnosed the problem, i did some googling and found that it was a known issue with the make and model of her car, and that vw would perform the repair for free.  while eddie didn't earn my business for this issue, his correct diagnosis earned him my business in the future.  points to them for their professionalism.

for my second visit, i brought in my 2016 chevrolet colorado to have a k&n cold air intake installed.  moe said they normally work on german cars, but that they would gladly install the intake for me.  it didn't take them long to complete the installation, and the billing for their time to install the intake was fair; best of all, my truck sounds great!  this shop is honest, and fair, i will definitely be back to cars again for anything i need for my truck, or my wife's suv."
489,positive,"dropped my car off for an oil change on the fly. tim was very nice over the phone and was able to schedule me same-day. this location is very close to the 55 bus line so i was able to drop off my car and still make it into work on time! great price, $26 out the door for my oil change w/ inspection and tire rotation. this location is open until after 7p making it ideal for office zombies in need of pick ups after 5. i'm very impressed with the friendly service i received. as a woman, i worry about the myriad of ""problems"" that will be found when i leave my car somewhere for a simple service. tim called to express a concern about my muffler. after a quick chat and more detailed inspection all was deemed a-ok and he even left a hand written note to let me know all was well. i'll certainly be returning! thanks the great experience."
490,positive,"when i take my car in to the kar shop i'm comforted in knowing it will be taken care of and this time was no different. at my last service, kris recommended that my motor mounts needed replacing and boy was he right! not only that, when replacing the motor mount they discovered that the transmission had one severed bolt and one on it's way out which they took care of. what a difference this made! my car now drives like it's new again!"
491,positive,"these guys did a fantastic job transforming my infinity g37. they installed a new cold air intake system, high flow cats and exhaust, coil overs, larger wheels and tires and did a dyno tune. mike did a great job helping me select the correct parts and made sure everything worked well together. picked up 40 hp and the car handles and drives like a sports sedan costing many more $$ than i have into it. had a small glitch with a check engine light and rich was right on it the next day and took care of it. would highly recommend this shop. for what was done to my car the pricing was fair and a great value. maybe not the cheapest but you get what you pay for and these guys are worth every penny. i will definitely be using dyno comp for all my performance car needs."
492,positive,"i had my suv  transmission  repaired at litchfield auto and they are the most professional & honest auto repair shop that i have ever done business with. they assessed the problem, gave me a firm quote and delivered the car back to me on time as promised. highly recommended and if you ever what to contact me about the  quality of work they preform please do so @ smeekers@msn.com."
493,positive,"service department - took my prius in when the check engine light came on and was helped by dan.  we had just bought the car from a different toyota dealership a month before.  dan was friendly and helpful, had a small problem with the gas cap fixed and even provided a complimentary car wash.  there was no charge and we were very happy customers!"
494,positive,"great customer service but needed a push to get it. 

not going into all the details. they ran into an issue with an oil change. didn't take responsibility for the problem. went home, did some research online and spoke with a auto repair shop owner, found out the issue was most likely (60 - 70%) was caused by the shop. contacted big o hq on their website. a few days later, got a call from ryan, the manager,  offering to take care of the problem. we arrived at a mutual agreement. they fixed the problem, even added freon to my ac no charge, and my next oil change is on the house. 

one more thing: i didn't care for trying to push a transmission flush. i suggest anyone thinking about it research it first. it can cause more problems then it's worth. if your transmission is working fine, the fluid isn't real dirty, not slipping or acting up, you probably don't need it. i'm not a mechanic, just passing along what i found out. 

i'm very happy with the final outcome and how it was handled. just wish they would've taken responsibility at the beginning, even partly would've been nice. hence the 4 stars and not 5."
495,positive,"phil (owner) is awesome. he truly cares about servicing your vehicle and not only that, but educating you on what services he performed and why he performed it. labor cost is average and compared to other places you go, the service here is definitely worth the labor cost above all other repair shops i've been to. i used to take my old 2000  camry down here that was just a ticking time bomb on when something new was going to go out. whether it be a starter or just my check engine light. phil kept that baby running all the way up to 275k miles until i made the personal decision to upgrade vehicles. keep it up lp auto repair! it's not just the work you do, but the extra service and care you provide! much appreciated"
496,positive,"i was in town for a funeral when my check engine light came on i called 2 other honda dealerships that were closer and was told they could not help.  

called sunnyside went out of there way and scheduled my vehicle in the next day.  they found the problem fixed it and had my vehicle back to me in a few hours.  the service department did a great job.  if i lived in the area i would only consider using them."
497,positive,"it all started when my check engine light started flashing while taking my eldest son to school. being the procrastinator that i am, i typically like to wait until i cant anymore but just with driving a mile round-trip, it was more than obvious something was *actually* wrong with my car. when i called the kar shop, kris (the owner) answered & when i asked how busy they were & if it'd be possible to have my car looked at fairly soon, he informed me that the sooner i could get it checked out, the better (apparently flashing = bad). not once did i feel like i was being taken advantage of due to my lack of knowledge relating to cars (i'm sure many females out there can relate!) but kris was extremely accommodating and drove me (& my other son) home so that we weren't stranded there until they were done! he also assured me that i'd either have my car back by the time i'd need to grab my older son from school or i'd be provided with a rental, which definitely helped alleviate some anxiety relating to the situation. turns out i needed a new cylinder and i also had them replace my passenger window motor that had just started having issues a couple weeks prior (and it was all done before school got out!). if i ever have any issues again, i know exactly who i can trust to do quality repairs at a reasonable price with phenomenal customer service!"
498,positive,"definitely a 5 star rating. i first went to dave's car care about 6 years ago with my isuzu amigo. i had 3 other mechanics diagnose an issue that i had with it because it wouldn't pass emissions. my gut told me that they weren't diagnosing it correctly so then i took it to dave's. i felt real comfortable with the diagnostics and the price. i went ahead and had them service my vehicle and it passed. most recently i had a transmission issue with my truck. i had them install a rebuilt one in the vehicle. unfortunately, it went bad after about 26 months and was no longer in warranty. thank god i had it serviced at dave's. they assisted me in purchasing and installing another rebuilt transmission at a fraction of the original one (even though the warranty had expired). i've since referred them to my friends and have been a loyal customer since. i will continue using them and highly recommend them to everyone."
499,positive,"my husband and i found this shop from yelp. my husband's car broke down on the freeway and he had to find somewhere to tow it to asap. we've both had mechanics here and there but never a place that we were really satisifed with...until this place. the owner alex is amazing! not only does he know exactly what he is doing, but we have never felt like we were getting ripped off. we now bring both of our cars there and have referred friends and coworkers to him. 

this is a mechanic who gives you his personal cell phone number. a mechanic who has actually driven to our house to look at our car when that lovely ""check engine light"" came on. 

we will never take our cars anywhere else. it's so rare to find a mechanic that is trustworthy in las vegas. 

(also fyi - the shop's address didn't come up when i entered it into my gps....it's basically off of lakemead and 215 in henderson. just call for directions)"
500,positive,"i brought my newly bought used car into c&s auto, that i would use for my ubering, that i bought from a seller that said ""everything is like new""...they lied. the motor was loose and about to fall out the car. c&s fixed this but then after i found out there was another hidden issue. the seller cleared the check engine light to fool me...i was burned by a local seller. i am not rich so this hurts everything i've worked for and effects my future. c&s understood my situation and made a deal to take money off the total price to help me out. they really care about their customers. i highly recommend them to anyone."
501,positive,"my car didn't pass the smog so took my car here to see what the problem was looks like my transmission needed to be replaced, i didn't have the money to fix it so he did what he can to buy us some time awesome guy really helped us out the lady in the office is super nice i will take my car back for any problems finally found an honest mechanic"
502,positive,took good care of me and kept me in the loop with my transmission problem went above and beyond. excellent service
503,positive,this is the place you have only heard of in dreams. a place that genuinely cares about the customer. we had taken in our 2016 dodge journey for a check engine light and when we explained the problem they suggested taking it into the dealer because it would likely be covered under the emissions warranty on the car. just the fact that they told us that was awesome. i know we will be coming here again with any issues we encounter with our car. thank you guys for being a stand up business.
504,positive,"march 2014 update:

i took my 2010 escape to whitey's for an oil change and have them check for a leak.

the tech did the oil change and found the problem with the transmission, which only shows up when the escape is traveling.  the whitey's tech asked if i had power train warranty, as i purchased the escape at auto nation ford; the escape came with as ford certified which is power train for 75,000 miles of 5 years, so i was covered. the whitey's tech told me there was a technical service bulletin on this issue and that i should go to the dealer to get it fixed under warranty. 

the staff at whitey's then printed out the technical service bulletin for me to take to auto nation ford!  

how many shops have this level of technical competence and then send you someplace else to get it fixed?

auto nation ford  fixed the problem which was exactly as whitey's found it.

i am happy with whitey's. i would never take either of my suv's to any other shop, unless they send me to the dealer. :-)"
505,positive,"so happy i found mechanics i can trust! i have taken my car to superior for a new starter, brakes & tires in the past. they do great work & are honest, affordable & fast. recently, i took my car in for what i thought was a transmission or some other major issue. it turned out to be a minor electrical problem that just needed to be reset. they took care of that at no charge. i could not be happier with their service. i highly recommend!!"
506,positive,"i can't tell you how wonderful jack was. i had a $900 estimate from my dealership. a friend told me to talk to jack. i needed a transmission flush and a tune up. $900!!!!! talk to jack, and after 2 full inspections (because he couldn't understand why the dealership wanted so much) he called me with an estimate for $350!!!! they were nice and very professional. thank you so much guys!"
507,positive,"this is the only auto repair place i've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.

my boyfriend has a 1969 pontiac firebird that hasn't run in several years. after sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the bird (yeah!) so i could drive it (yes, i am super lucky!)

whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). upon hearing the story of meineke, whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  awesome!

we took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. back to the shop it went.

whitey's took it back, spent all weekend on it doing various minor things. at one point, they called and said ""we've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   i was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but i was dreading the repair bill.

we picked it up tuesday. the bill? $7. that's right - seven dollars. they only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. that is amazing to me - i was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  

the car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. i'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. i highly recommend whitey's!"
508,positive,i have all the work done on my cars at lifetime automotive.  recently i had to take my truck in cause the transmission was going out.  the owner went above and beyond to find me many affordable options to replace it.  this is just one of may reasons i love this shop and the people who work there.  they are honest and there prices are the best.  thanks lifetime automotive for taking care of my vehicles and for the awesome service at a affordable price.
509,positive,"chris aizpitarte is amazing! he knew exactly what the issue was with my car as soon as i told him what it was doing! i had taken it to my local nissan dealer in july when i first had this issue and they just blew me off! 
my transmission needed to be replaced and he had it all done very fast! brought it to the dealership on saturday morning and it was done late afternoon on monday!"
510,positive,"we are very satisfied with our service here! we worked with brian k - he took his time with us, explained everything in detail, called us with updates, patiently answered our questions, and got our car back to us much faster than we expected. i highly recommend this shop if you need to have your car repaired. the service was excellent, and our car looks incredible. i also really appreciate that gerber offers a lifetime guarantee. i know it is unfortunate to have to have your car repaired, but this is a place you can really trust!"
511,positive,"i recently went to this autozone because my check engine light was on.  while i was waiting to be helped, i had noticed one of the employees outside helping an older gentleman replace something, maybe a headlight.  when they were finished, i noticed they shook hands and the customer left very happy.  then, it was my turn.  i told the employee, randy, why i was in and he immediately came out to check the codes.  while we were out there, i mentioned to him that i wanted to address this issue so i could then fix the whistling sound i was hearing from the engine. randy immediately asked me to pop the engine so he could take a look.  within a minute, he identified the problem.  without my asking, he said he'd be back & returned with a replacement hose, installing it for me.  it was then that i realized this type of service was just protocol for randy.  he truly enjoys helping others.  a side benefit is he is the reason why customers will return.

many times when visiting autoparts stores, it seems to me that the employees are disinterested in helping their customers really understand and resolve their concerns.  their role is to solely identify the correct replacement part and sell it to you.  after this, you are on your own.  

if you are lucky enough to visit this autozone while randy is working, i am confident you will leave a more informed & satisfied customer.  thanks, randy, for putting in the little extra effort that makes a big difference!!"
512,positive,have to say pete knows his transmissions.  had my avalanche in and out so quick for about half the price elsewhere. friendly people who you can tell have been here doing this for a long time. quoted a price over the phone and no hidden fees. the other transmission place i went to said they would have to actually take my tranny off to give me an accurate quote. they quoted 2000-3000$ which is a big gap. it was 1150 out the door here at petes  it was the holiday and they still had it done in 2 business days. and i also had a complicated payment situation which they made easy and painless. thanks again for knowing what great service means!
513,positive,"i needed an oil change and went back to superior tire since they did a great job last year w my alignment at a fair price for a lifetime alignment.  thomas got my car in pretty quick even though they were busy.  after about an hour, he told me there was an issue he wanted to show me.  he brought me back to check out my transmission seal leak, but didn't pressure me to fix it that day.  he gave me an estimate to fix it and just let me know it needed to be done.  no pressure to fix it 'today' (and it seemed like a fair price).  while he also gave me an option to replace the front axle (since it was only a small addition in time and price), he didn't try to push me into fixing it (only pointed out the benefit if i chose to fix it ).  thanks thomas and the rest of the team at superior tire."
514,positive,"my 9 year old hyundai decided to give up in a parking garage.  big jim was the recommendation of aaa once it was determined i was beyond their services.  big jim talked me through my transmission problems, found a used one that was a perfect match, and gave me options of investment vs. results. he was easy to talk to and kept me updated on progress.  he gave me straight answers when i asked about preventative actions moving forward (spoiler: northeast winters are an inevitable death sentence).  vehicle drives just the way i'm used to.  i will definitely be bringing my vehicle back - exponentially better than the dealership i dealt with back in nj.  thank you"
515,positive,"my boyfriend and i decided to stay here for 4th of july weekend, and overall it was a great stay. check-in was super easy and fast. parking is $14 a night which kind of stinks but it is less expensive than other hotels in the area. they don't tell you that there is a fee; i only knew from reading reviews online so beware of that. i had no problem with the parking lot. you use your room key to get through the gate and there were plenty of spaces when we were there. 

the room was very clean, spacious, and updated. there was a microwave and mini fridge which was nice. our view was of a rocky rooftop so that was kind of a bummer, but we weren't expecting anything spectacular. 
housekeeping came everyday and were very good. we ate breakfast there twice, but didn't get there until 9:15 so there wasn't a crazy selection left but decent enough. there was cereal, oatmeal, sausage, eggs, bagels, english muffins, and cinnamon rolls which were delicious.

one of the main reasons why i chose this hotel was because they have a shuttle which drives you anywhere within a 3 mile radius (which is pretty much anywhere since everything is so close). we used the shuttle the first day to go to station square which is only 1 mile away. it was quick and easy. around 10 pm we called the hotel to have the shuttle pick us up, and he told us that the transmission broke on the shuttle and it's not running anymore. ok, no big deal, we just took uber back. the next day we asked about the shuttle and found out that another hotel was working with our hotel and we could get picked up by them. they arrived quickly and we got dropped off at point state park. we called our hotel again around 10:10 pm (the shuttle is supposed to run until 10:30), and asked if we could get picked up. the guy was like ummmm the shuttle hasn't been running all day. so i explained that earlier on in the day we used the other hotel's shuttle. he knew nothing about that and again we were stranded, so we took another uber. if the transmission broke then fine, but i have my suspicions that the transmission didn't actually break and the driver just wanted off for the holiday weekend because it just seemed like pretty convenient timing and the van was only sitting at the hotel after it ""broke"" for the holiday. but who knows.

the location of the hotel is awesome. there is a domino's on the same street and and gas station/convenience store as well. you can walk 2 blocks down and you are on e carson st which is where all of the bars and restaurants are, so you don't have to worry about transportation back from there because you can just walk. 

we were going to stay at the wyndham instead of this hotel because it would have been convenient for the fireworks but chose this instead because it was cheaper, parking was cheaper, they didn't have a microwave and fridge in the room, and based on reviews the rooms seem to be cleaner here. i would stay at this hotel again definitely, i just wish there was more of a view of the river at least from the room we stayed in. but overall it was a very good experience."
516,positive,"so i have been to a few of these firestones and jiffy lube type places with my company car because of the fleet services preferred vendors.  i have been to both this firestone location now, as well as the one on william penn hwy just down the road a bit.  these two locations are not created equal in my experience.  if you want a good, trustworthy firestone to go to, i say go here!  

i had just had my car into a jiffy lube for a check up exactly two weeks before i had to come in here... they said everything was fine, did what they had to (change oil and filter) and sent me on my way. i do not expect them to find every little thing but when they said they did what the fleet company had asked, i assumed that they looked at some of the other basics.  my check engine light came on thursday (just 13 days after this) and i had to get it in somewhere.  i remembered that the mall had a location (at least i can go get lunch and walk around if it will take awhile, right?).  the location on william penn hwy was fine but after i had my experience with this one, i will be loyal here... they were able to fix something that the wm penn hwy location could not and was not willing to (a terrible sound of a loose heat shield). 

they got me in right away, kept me posted on where they were at with things, looked at the whole picture of things, dealt with my fleet company, and fixed something that i was told could not be fixed.  the few staff that i had interacted with were so helpful and nice too.  this made what was an annoying experience and unforeseen problem/stressor better. 

i will definitely be taking all of my service here now as i cannot complain about anything."
517,positive,this repair shop gets a+. my uncles suv is having transmission problems. jim took my uncle out with him for a test drive to see what was happening. i'm so glad jim is a straight shooter and my uncle is 80 years old and he didn't bs my uncle and take advantage of him like other shops do. i talked with jim about the pros and cons of replacing the transmission or let my uncle just drive it until it breaks. the suv is a 2007 and the cost of a new transmission was almost the value of the value of the suv. we decided to hold off on the transmission    i highly recommend talking to jim if you are having transmission problems. he's a straight shooter we need more repair shops like this one.  kudos jim
518,positive,"had an appointment to get my transmission oil flushed 9am, dropped car off at 830am.. got $25 off from yelp! but also offered other coupons they offer..
met with the store manager john trent & he was great!!! i have an older car 2005.. its normal to always be skeptical when going in to mechanic shops, bcuz they try to rip you off... not this place.. 
ended up also getting my rear brakes, drums etc fixed cuz i had trust in this place.. let you test drive car after work done, showed you hands on, no bs.. 
highly recommended..
also.... this store has the cleanest bathroom that i have ever seen in a mechanic shop!!!!!"
519,positive,"my review is about service, not sales. i have no information about the sales side of things. i was in town with my husband on a business trip. i had my car serviced at carmax in inglewood, ca before heading to lv. carmax said everything was fine, they replaced some valve (that turns out probably didn't even need to be replaced), and the engine light went off, so we headed out for the trip. well, it was not fine. the engine started racing at times and then would drag horribly to the point that 18-wheelers were passing us going uphill. we were worried about getting stranded in the dessert in 110 degree temp with little to no cell signal and towns miles apart. we finally made it to lv, and i called a dodge dealership the next morning to have them check it. i happened to call chapman and talked with david richards.

david was awesome. he told me that i needed a new catalytic converter (which carmax cleared the signal on and obviously didn't test drive it to find out if it was fixed and therefore it didn't get replaced) and that the carmax service person installed the valve wrong, which is why the check engine light came back on. i called carmax corporate and told them the nightmare of what we had gone through. it was a really long, painful story. she was helpful. she understood the seriousness of the problem that we experienced and got some managers on it. they called me, and they worked with david to take care of the check engine diagnostic fee.  chapman replaced my cat (which most other dealerships i talked to in the days prior didn't even keep in stock) under the dodge warranty but still wanted their diagnostic fee. i understood but i wasn't about to pay it since carmax had screwed me. the big wig at carmax in ca arranged payment to david (all they had to do was put a pin in correctly to seat the valve), and chapman had the cat replaced in a jiffy. i couldn't believe it.

i'm grateful to david for all the support and working with carmax and to chapman  for all the rides to and from my hotel. we had no trouble on the way back to los angeles. i hope i never have to have service again while in lv, but if i do, i know where i'm taking my car."
520,positive,"prices are industry standard $95/hr. the difference is if nothing is wrong with the car they won't charge anything. i've been going here since 2012. several times i've got estimates for repair work and on at least two occasions check engine light was tripped for nothing and they didn't charge me. if your having difficulty diagnosing a problem and don't wanna spend the $ take it here. if you tell them about a problem and take it in for an oil change they will borderline advance diagnose your car for you to find the problem wo charging. they catch problems other shops don't. they explain in detail what's happening or why some parts are preventitive maintenance. it's been a nice place to frequent, the atmosphere is really friendly and unlike other businesses in the area everyone is welcome no matter where your from."
521,positive,"my check engine light came on a couple of weeks ago. i went to two autozones and they could not read it. came here and they did.

i always thought that o'reilly's had more experienced people working there in general. i still do!"
522,positive,"$7.77 cheapest smog check in town. they also check out your car for maintenance issues but there's no pressure to repair anything they find.

wait is a bit long, but that's what happens when things cost less. show up early or be prepared to wait about half an hour.

tip: if your check engine light is on you will automatically fail the smog check. take care of that first. just clearing the codes at autozone can work. or take it to panda at desert inn and jones."
523,positive,"2 cars/2 transmissions in less than a year.

brothers and owners, brian and kevin have replaced the transmission in two of my cars.  one done in spring, 2012, the other, february 2013.  i've had 2 excellent experiences. 

i had never heard of them before but pursued them upon a recommendation.  the second time i needed their service, i met their dad who gave me a little bit of background about the shop he started years ago.

brian and kevin grew up learning from their father who started his fairview park transmission business back in the 40's. he had  to relocate and the shop has been in north olmsted for years.

to top it off, park auto clinic's price is excellent.  a family member had an estimate of 1,600 dollars from another shop.  i told them to go to park auto clinic--a couple of hundred dollars cheaper-- great work--dedicated family-run business.
 
these guys have worked on transmissions all of their life and that's all they do.  they are experts.  

by the way, they had both my cars done within three days of dropping them off.   and, with both of my cars, they asked me to come back within 3-4 weeks to make sure that everything was working well.  

these gentlemen are some of the most honest, nice people i've ever dealt with.  i can't say enough about what a great experience i've had twice with park auto clinic"
524,positive,"this place did a fantastic job.  every single person i spoke to here was friendly, welcoming & courteous.  the process to have my car repaired was streamlined & it was ready 3 days earlier than they estimated.  my car was hit by someone with geico insurance.  this was one of their preferred repair shops.  in house geico inspector & enterprise car rentals.  they fixed the damage, replaced my bumper, did body work above my fender & passenger door.  repainted & matched the original paint perfectly.  this process couldn't have been easier.  robert was great too.  thank you!"
525,positive,usa auto get the job done efficiently and they will treat you respectfully never have i been hustled like in other places i am coming back to do transmission and coolant services thank you guys
526,positive,"i was first introduced to joe's auto avondale, az by a flyer advertisement that came in the mail. at the time, i needed to get a transmission service and a fuel injection service. they had some coupons in the advertisement for the services i needed. the prices were amazing compared to the gm dealer. i arrived at the location 10/30/14 to get the services completed.  one of the managers taylor provided excellent customer services, he was knowledgeable to answer my car service questions, he was up front with the costs associated with the job and they are efficient and work quickly. this place offers such a great value at an affordable price. i was very impressed with my first experience. joe's auto is a simple family owned auto shop with 5 other stores in arizona. the storefront is clean, they have some chairs to sit while you wait, a nice tv and free wifi if you ask. 

on 11/4/14, i was back to get my check engine light checked out to diagnose the issue. jeff had checked me in and processed my service. he provided awesome customer services, was knowledgeable in answering all my questions and it was a personable experience.  i ended up needing an intake camshaft actuating part for my engine since the hydraulic mechanism was non-operational. it was a dealer only part so they had the part delivered within 45 minutes and the job was completed in 1 hour and 45 minutes. again, i was very happy and impressed with my experience here. i highly recommend taking your vehicle here for future services. why pay more at the dealer when you can support a family owned business and get your vehicle services done at a reasonable price. keep up the great work guys! to the owner - keep your employees happy and take good care of them because they are clearly running your business very well. i will tell everyone i know about my experience here and share all around social media. thanks!"
527,positive,"ok. so, that tranmission thing is important. if you don't check on it every year, the fluids and all that jazz, it could go very wrong and if your tranmission blows, it can cost a whopper to fix. so we must be preventative. but i'm the luckiest girl in the world. my dad maintains my car for me. he winterizes it. he has a solid relationship with a local mechanic when the job is more complicated then he can do (and my dad can do a lot!). my dad's work is basically fixing up cars and selling them. he knows cars. and my whole family drives 90's vehicles (we're old school!). but we take a lot of pride in our cars!

my dad uses national transmission.
so i use national tranmission.
now that i'm a big girl, i take my car there myself.
i call them up and usually talk to the ever-pleasant brock at the beginning of the week.
i say i need to have my transmission serviced.
usually they do it on wed, thurs or fri morning, i think. or maybe that's when you can get fit in easily. usually it'll be at 9 or 10 am. they need it for a good 1-1.5 hours. so i drop it off, walk into kensington for a coffee, return and voila! magic. done. reasonable. friendly.

you certainly don't have to fear looking after your car with places like this. my dad trusts them and my dad knows cars so i feel good in recommending this location!"
528,positive,"ewing has a customer for life in my husband and i. we went out to red rock canyon for what we thought would be a quick drive. hadn't been off roading recently but we were going to check out an easy run. pulled off to the side of a trail and husband tried to engage the 4 wheel drive. after a small struggle to engage the gear, we lost all tension in the 4 wheel drive and lost any gears in the normal transmission. we were afraid we had blown the transmission completely. as we started counting dollar signs of repair in our heads, we flagged down some park workers who said they would send a ranger out to us. 20 min later, a ranger found us and called in a tow. based on where we were, a flatbed wasn't going to work. a four wheel drive wrecker was the only option...at an estimated rate of $275 an hour...and a 2-3 hour wait. being 2:30 already...we resigned to being in it for the long haul. the ranger came back to let us know that they found a wrecker to be there in an hour. thank god!

as we enjoyed the scenery of red rocks and big horn goats, we eyed the wrecker coming up the trail. jon showed up with a great attitude and conversational spirit. he could have easily just strung the jeep up and pulled us back to town but...he problem solved with us. luckily, a fellow jeeper stopped by and offered help. turns out transmission was generally fine, we just busted the 4 wheel drive cable. jon was able to leverage the cable back to the 2h position and we drove out of the trail...thousands of dollars saved. 

jon will be getting a christmas gift from the bennett's this year."
529,positive,"friendly guy @ the service dept. my check engine light was on so he made sure he checked everything out including recalls on my 09 kia borrego and had them all taken care of. dropped off the car b4 11am car was washed and ready @3pm, for dealership wait time that's not too bad. my car is under warranty so it was no charge but now i know a service place that is knowledgeable and reliable for any of my kia needs!"
530,positive,"we drove to las vegas on vacation from los angeles, which is a 300 mile drive.  during the last 60 miles, we noticed something terribly wrong with our honda odyssey and drove slowly on the shoulder until we got into town.  we first took the minivan to sears auto repair, but they said we needed to go to a honda specialist.  we next went to the local honda dealer.  the mechanic hooked the vehicle up to the computer and said the code indicated that we needed a new transmission.  they proceeded to write up a quote for $4,600.  the vehicle is a 2004 model with only 89,000 miles on it.  based upon all the positive reviews on yelp, we took our minivan to james at hondatronics.  james told us that the code said that there was a gear problem, but that he did not know for sure whether we needed a new transmission or not.  he recommended that we flush the transmission fluid a few times since it was extremely dirty and gritty, which cost us only $226.  he then suggested that we drive it around town, and that we stop back before we leave vegas to make sure the fluid is still clean (which we did and it was).  should we need a new transmission, james quoted us $3,300.  james suggested we drive home keeping the speed under 65 mph and the rpms below 2500.  we followed james' advice and made it home safely without any problems.  now we can drive the vehicle around town and see what happens.  we may still need a new transmission.  only time will tell.  but the problem may prove to be only that we needed clean transmission fluid.  imagine spending $4,600 at the honda dealership for something we may not even need.  james was honest and up front, kind and helpful, and we really appreciated all that he did for us.  we were really lucky to have found james, given that we were from out of town and did not know anyone from whom we could have gotten a personal referral.  but thanks to yelp we found this gem!"
531,positive,"this is by far the best used car dealership in las vegas.  it takes a lot for a dealership (or any type of business for that matter) to portray exceptional effort and go the extra mile to accomodate any and all used car needs that cartwright does. they have exhibited true humanity by being able to acknowledge, rectify, and learn from all past mishaps and discrepincies that they, unfortunately, conducted in the past due to circumstances beyond their control at the time. 
in october of last year, i purchased a used mercedes in what seemed to be in overall good condition.  i test drove it and had all vital areas checked out to conclude it all seemed to be in good working order. the signing and over all initial mandatory purchase paperwork was rather smooth. november i ran into a ""hiccup"" with some questions on the contact and a couple minor issues with the vehicle that wasn't disclosed.  two months later (december), my car began to have major transmission issues. i took it back in (again) to see what could be done to fix this problem, since it had only been a couple months. i will admit, i went through hell and high water for about three months with them over various issues. i won't get into the specifics, but literally had never been through such a stressful ordeal to this caliber. i had enough and couldn't take it anymore and was ready to pursue legal action. 
low and behold, i had called one last time in february only to find out that due to, great misfortune, there had been a lot of scandalous people that manifested a plethora of havoc and issues in various ways and had just been caught. 
i was assured that every employee that had previously worked there had been immediately terminated and the new plan of action was to correct all negative experiences/ issues with past clients to the best of their ability. they have definitely delivered on that promise. i have never witnessed a company go so out of their way to make things right with a consumer. it's truly shocking that a dealership could be humble enough to admit that, unfortunately, they were a tarnished company for a minute duration; but have the determination to right wrongs and continue to persevere. they certainly have with me and i would absolutely purchase my next vehicle from them and, with great confidence, recommend them to everyone."
532,positive,"took my van to here after finding them on google. they were able to see me right away and give me some info on what was wrong with it as the check engine light was on. after about half an hour, they found what was wrong and said they needed to take it to the dealer for a warranty part to be replaced and were going to keep it overnight. the next day after it was fixed, they offered to get the emissions tested for me also at the state station. ben was great to deal with and explained everything to me during every step. 

i would recommend them for any of your vehicles needs. they do everything there. i have a new mechanic."
533,positive,i had a super positive experience with alex. another dealership quoted me 2k just for the transmission. at camelback vw i got quoted 848 + tx and the regulator on my window was repaired. they were honest to me and updated me via email and text. i am so happy with them! ask for alex. they totally turned around my opinion of vw dealerships!
534,positive,"we had my daughter's car repaired after it was hit on nye , and we needed it back by january 13 for her to go back to college in az. many shops could not get to this job before jan 21. maaco was friendly, accommodating, fast, professional, and courteous. we elected to have it repainted as there was some minor hail damage prior. the 2010 mazda 3 looks fantastic, they did it within the time frame they promised and even gave me a ride all the way to anthem when we dropped it off! i highly recommend them. everyone here is very professional and respectful."
535,positive,"first off, i want to let people know that buying a used car is a gamble.  most used cars are as-is situations.  if you buy from a private seller you really are taking a big chance.
getting back to buying from four seasons motor company.  i purchased a 2013 ford escape from them on a monday morning.  the price was right ($10,500.) and the vehicle looked in excellent condition.  i took it home and realize that it had a whining noise coming from the rear of the car.  after listening to the noise out on the freeway i determined that i needed to call the owner tammie the same day.  she immediately  connected me to larry, he told me to bring the car in the next day. 
i showed up at 930 am, i met mike and we both went on a road test.  he determined that the rear wheels bearings were bad.  we went back to the office and the owner tammie had keys for a loaner car for me to take while they got my car repaired.  at 430 pm same day i received a call telling me that the car was repaired.  they replaced both rear hubs with bearings at the cost off $409.00 which they paid. 

this is truly great customer service from four seasons motor company for  my purchase.  i want to thank the owner tammie and the staff mike for showing that they are a first class operation.  buying a car from them was a great experience and i would do it again.

thank you

536,positive,"top notch customer service!! i'm new to las vegas and researched auto places in my area and this place stood out. i got a full tune up and more (oil change, spark plugs, ignition sensor, air filter, transmission flush and airbag service). i'm very satisfied and highly recommend this place. i didn't have to wait longer than two hours. must go."
537,positive,"amazing! we were driving through from salt lake to la when our check engine light came on. found this place via yelp and we pulled in after the repair shop closing hours. but the guys were still there and were incredibly nice and ran diagnostics and stayed late to fix the spark plug misfire and ran full diagnostics and got us back on the road that evening. and, here's the kicker, the price was super fair. i can't recommend these people highly enough. pulling into an unknown car repair shop is a leap of faith at the best of times, but a few minutes before closing on a friday night with an unknown problem is a setup for disaster. so lucky we found this shop!!"
538,positive,"i never thought i would give van chevrolet a glowing review, but i am!! i had a 2012 camaro zl1 that i took into service years ago and was not impressed by the service or lack of it!! at that time the service department could not have been less helpful and non caring!! how things have changed!! i brought my 2015 corvette z06 with a problem with the car jerking when i braked normal. i was assigned my service consultant kevin martin (excellent)!! i explained to him the problem gave him the fob to my z06 and left in a car provided by van chevrolet. i heard from kevin multiple times keeping in touch and filling me in on the progress. he called and told me that they found it was a transmission problem probably linked to the multiple computers onboard the corvette. they found the computer system had to be reprogramed to fix the problem. once that was done, everything was fixed and they even realigned my corvette. i have nothing but good things to say about van chevrolet and how they took care of me and my corvette! but in my opinion none of this would have happened without the excellent attention to detail by my service consultant kevin martin!!"
539,positive,recently had my transmission replaced in my corvette. even though this was warranty work their team communicated with me every step of the way. they had my car in and out within 5 days and handled all of the warranty communications for me. they fought for a replacement and not a rebuild which is what i got! on top of all of this my out of pocket for uncovered items was well below their estimate. this is now my families go to from now on.
540,positive,"i told my wife to go and get the car checked out.  in all fairness, my wife's naïveté precedes her.  i've found that mechanics always 'inflate' their prices until i show up and challenge it.  while damon found a number of issues that absolutely need to be replaced, a quote from $710 to something just above $500 isn't.  

i never had damon as my mechanic - chris always took careof my cars.  this time around, marlene seemed very cold and not the friendly person i'm used to.

consistency, as you'll find in my posts, is important to me.  i no longer recommend this place.  

02/22/2018 - responding to andrew a's note:

it's a shame, but i'm happy for chris.  being new to vegas it was hard finding a shop you could trust.  chris made an effort to try and salvage what happened with my wife and i just couldn't get over what that guy quoted her.  i'm in sales for a living and i always try to be a straight shooter.  aiming high to negotiate is expected but 40%-50% over what it should have cost was messed up - how do you go from $700+ to $400 in the space of 2 conversations?  the guy even tried to do the fast math on me like i was buying a timesh

chris and marlene are a great team.  marlene makes usa like you're norm coming in to aisle up to the bar.  chris gives it to you straight.  i really should have given them a chance to make it up to me, but i was forced to go out of the way to get it done.

if chris and marlene open a new place you can count i'll be going back, but not until they get rid of some of the people at usa auto.


update 05/25
needed a smog check.  usa's smog deal at $7.99 is the best in town.  met with big chris, who pointed out some issues with my vehicle that were a result of going to an 'independent' mechanic in north town.  the hoses that were replaced by the mechanic was done sloppy - corrosion had seeped out from the connections.  

big chris showed me the condition of my transmission fluid and offered to clean it up.

now, let me rewind here.  john summers, the former manager, and marlene had reached out to me after my last post to set things right, but i had become gun shy after. they're effort to win me back was a $100 credit to any service.  i didn't think i would ever need it, but i mentioned it to big chris who gave marlene a call and got it authorized.

even without john summers as the current manager (he moved on), big chris kept their promise.

i'm back with my favorite auto experts and will definitely back again.  thank you for the experience!

another update 07/18
damon's in charge.  i took up john on his offer to have a fuel purge sensor engine light checked out.  i knew what the issue was due to my fixd sensor that i bought a few years back.  

he honored the $100 an threw in  tire rotation and an oil change.  now, i checked around with the costs to compare and found that while he was on the high side, he 'ate' it on the labor.  here's why - he goes to the dealer for parts and i understand how cash businesses work - he has to mark it up in order to show a profit.  classic effort to reward.  fair is fair.  he goes to the dealer because it's not a 'what if' or 'lets try this' shop.  prices are a bit higher from the dealer, but we know it works.

fast forward 2 weeks.  check engine light comes on.  i freak out - i'm leaving town in 2 days and taking the car to socal.  it's great on gas - better than my beast infiniti that drives fast, but guzzles gas like a thirsty man in a desert.  he cuts me a deal.  says, i'll take care of it now and when you get back from vacation, hit me up and we'll take care of it - i'll charge you for the part only.

done.  i honestly declare that this is the best auto shop in vegas.  honest, straightforward and they'll do what they have to, to make you happy.  

props to damon.  he's the best there is."
541,positive,i called these guys based on the experiences of the previous yelpers- which frankly sounded too good to be true. thanks yelpers! scottsdale muffler and automotive really is as great as you said! i needed my muffler and tailpipe replaced. i dropped the vehicle off before they opened in the morning. they called me with an estimate within a couple hours of opening and the price was awesome and much lower than i expected. they had the vehicle ready for pick up by the end of the day and...here's the best part ----***** they charged me exactly what they said!***** i have lots of work to be done on my vehicles and i'll be going back thanks you guys!
542,positive,"i first came to atwood european 3 years ago after taking my 2007 cls550 to a local dealership (who shall remain nameless) after having a strong smell of gasoline around my car inside and out - and in my garage - after fueling.  the dealership assured me the entire fuel tank had to be replaced at a cost of over $3,500.00.  i authorized some other work at the dealership regarding an issue with my trunk not opening and closing reliably and decided to seek a second opinion about the fuel smell.  fortunately, i was talking to a co-worker whose parents had been taking their cars to atwood for years with nothing but satisfying results.  i took my car there and after inspecting the vehicle, andrew and his team determined that in fact, my fuel tank was fine and that my fuel pump was leaking and needed to be replaced - a $280 part - and that repair immediately (and permanently) solved the problem.

six months later, i was still having problems with the trunk from the dealer's so-called repair and was due for routine service anyway, so i took the car back to atwood.  i ended up needing full rear brakes and front pads as well, which i expected as i was starting to hear the usual warning sounds when pads are worn.  andrew and team were able to determine that the issue with my trunk was actually a problem with wires in the wiring harness that were damaged due to wear (a design issue with this car) and instead of recommending replacing the entire harness, they repaired the section that was damaged, saving me hundreds in parts and much more in labor.

a year later, i had a front suspension strut beginning to fail and i took the car to atwood.  andrew was able to replace the strut with a part carrying a lifetime warranty (something a dealer can't/won't do), and he even refunded a day of my car rental due to timing issues with when he could get the car repaired.

last year, i had a complete transmission failure while on a trip in sedona (on a holiday, no less) and consulted with andrew after leaving my car at another small independent shop in sedona (redrock precision motors - i highly recommend them as well).  i ended up having them replace the transmission with a rebuild carrying an unlimited mileage warranty.

most recently, my other front strut failed as i was leaving for a trip to flagstaff to visit my daughter at college.  this time, it was a more dramatic failure, requiring towing to the shop.  when we arrived at the shop late on a friday afternoon, andrew's lot was nearly full - inside and out - telling me that business is good, but also signaling that it might take a while to get my car done.  one of his crew drove me to the car rental place so that i could get a car to continue my slightly delayed weekend.  they didn't have to do this, but offered to because they knew the car rental shop was slammed and would take a while to come get me.  when i came back to town on monday, i checked in with atwood's answering service a couple times and was not terribly surprised not to hear back right away, knowing how busy they were.  as it turns out, their internet and phones were down on monday and andrew spent most of the night there with the service provider getting back online.  he called me back on tuesday morning after getting all his messages and, much to my surprise told me that my car would be ready that afternoon if i approved the detailed estimate he gave me.  i arrived at the shop and everything was to my satisfaction - the work was done promptly and within the estimate we discussed by phone that morning.

i've gone a long way here to demonstrate a pattern - a pattern of dependable and honest service that i've received from atwood.  i know cars very well - i have several (and have owned many more) and work on many of them myself and am not someone who could be easily deceived or swayed by a shyster.  andrew and his crew have always been up-front and straightforward about all the repairs and service i've had done there - often going beyond the call of duty to save me time and money - and i will continue to be a customer for as long as i continue to own european brands."
543,positive,"the key tower stands at 948 feet tall in downtown cleveland. the terminal tower is 771 feet.  people perch by the river valley in tremont for pictures with the cleveland skyline in the background. i encourage the reader to venture 10 miles south to parma, oh and climb 500 feet in elevation to the highlands. there is a beautiful collection of television and radio towers there. most are taller than the key tower and in my estimation it is a far more unique and interesting photo op. wikipedia says that this grouping of towers is second only to mount wilson in la. i stood at the foot of one of these hulking beasts today and almost lost my balance when i kept moving my neck to see the top. maybe equilibrium was lost because of the tower transmissions burrowing a hole into my brain. i harken back to one of the greatest films of all time they live by john carpenter starring roddy piper. the mission of the protagonist was to stop radio towers from programming our population thereby destroying humanity. i am conflicted with the plot because i love these towers so much and would never want any harm done to them. come check out the towers when you have a chance. don't worry about rf radiation exposure. you will not be sorry.

544,positive,great service and price!  rob is a very straightforward honest guy!  i started going here awhile back and now i get all muffler work done here
545,positive,"got my transmission replaced on my 02 toyota corolla. they gave me a great quote, and they even lowered it after talking to them more about my situation. they completed the rebuild very quickly and they communicated with me professionally and often, keeping me informed. they were so kind to me each time i was at the office. they definitely made a stressful situation a lot easier to handle. they have a good warranty, and are very willing to check anything if you think something is up or just for regular check ups on the new transmission. a bit out of the way from me, and not necessarily the best part of town, but i would definitely recommend them!"
546,positive,"ok, i thought for awhile about what to say on yelp about hondatromics, and came up with a myriad of things.  i really want to keep this as short as possible yet be comprehensive about my feelings toward hondatronics, and james and nicole bean, the owners.

i began taking an acura rsx-s to hondatronics (from here on out i will refer to this store as h.t.) when james and nicole purchased it from keith doyle, who opened the store years before.  i was scared when james and nicole took over as i had a few acura and hondas and was always pleased with keith's work.  h was honest, professional, fair, and amazing. since the new owners took the reins, h.t. his only gotten better.  on my 2nd visit i witnessed something which james said he honesty doesn't recall.  i lady was at h.t. to pick up her civic. by the symptoms she outlined, james had prepared hermit the news that she, likely, needed a new transmission; and she was given an estimate of $1,800.  she had the cash in her hand when she entered the store, ready to pay. while waiting for a bit for james to come in from the service bay, we talked.  she said she was a 6th grade teacher, and was not prepared in the least for a new transmission, especially since educators are so seriously under-paid for the job they do. she was not happy, until james came in.  he told her that he was able to correct the problem by seriously cleaning out her gears and changing out the transmission fluid, along with some kind of filter.  her bill?  she owed h.t. a grand total of $78!!!!!  (and james had already begun apologizing that her bill was that much.). remember that she had $1,800 in her hand, ready to pay!!!  after that visit, my feelings toward h.t., james, and nicole were confirmed.  i was in the right place, and dealing with the right people.

ok, that was a few years back, but the fact remain the same.  i have been back to h.t. probably 45'times since then.  i have always been treated with professionalism and honestly.  i haven't always liked hearing what james or nicole have told me regarding what they found wrong or the price to fix it, but not once have i ever questioned their findings or the price to fix it.  they have always been straightforward with me, and always given me a price lower than every other store that specialized in repairing honda products.  i'm so happy to have found this shop and james and nicole that i even asked him to repair my honda lawnmower, but he politely declined .  

these people and their shop deserve the support of this community. they have worked very hard, and have earned every customer they have by doing everything with honesty and integrity as the foundation for their  success.  my cars will forever be handled by nicole, james, and hondatronics.  

recently i pondered the idea of a bmw for my next car.  i quickly changed my mind when james told me he doesn't work on bmws.  thanks for all the care and honesty you have shown me and my family over the years.  (and especially for talking me out of the beemer.)"
547,positive,"the room is big, comfortable and well designed. very spacious. i really like the buttons around the bed to open/close the curtains. little green lights on each light switch so you know where they are in the middle of darkness.

the bed and pillow is a bit too soft for me but i still got a very good sleep.

the major issue is noise. i stayed on the 20th floor but i can hear car with big muffler or bikes cruising down the strip. my room is next to the housekeeping office and the staff likes to talk with the door open. i wish they can use better materials to sound proof the room.

i ate at the tetsu teppanyaki restaurant is the food is excellent. the jean philipe bakery right next to the room-access elevators serves crepes, sandwichs, salads, coffee and everything you need for a quick meal. and the chocolate (though overpriced) is very nice.

i didn't play in the casino since i don't gamble but i feel this hotel has much less people smoking compared to others. $15 min for blackjack or roulette bet seems to be the norm there."
548,positive,"while driving on my way back home my car suddenly stopped in a place. i got out of the car and checked the exhaust pipe but found out nothing was wrong with it. i also tried checking the engine but could find nothing wrong with it. but when leavitts auto care came, they told me in matter of minutes that the problem lay with the transmission machine and gave an instant estimate of my expenditures too. since then, i have always trusted leavitts auto care for any work that involves maintenance and repair of my car. their mechanics are really very good at diagnosing cars."
549,positive,love the yelp check in $7.77 for a smog!!!!  i was in and out in less than 10mins. they were bz too!!!!  my husband brought his car here for check engine light and they told him which part he needed he bought it and they installed it for a decent price !!!! a+++++ service
550,positive,"we were on a roadtrip from new orleans to los angeles. vegas was our last stop and right when we literally got on the freeway to go home, my check engine light came on. this was scary because we were from out of town, and what if we went to a local mechanic and they rip us off because knowing we are desperately trying to get home!

hondatronics saved our butts! we drove up about an hour before closing, and the super nice guy who was there (i forgot his name but i think he was the owner) said he would do the diagnoses of the check engine light. he came out the car and did the check (i drive a 1997 honda cr-v with over 189,000 miles on it, and of course we had just driven all the way across the country). he said the engine was running lein, but we should be fine to drive all the way back to los angeles and turned the light off for us. he didn't mind that we obviously couldn't give him the business, he was just being an awesome nice guy and didn't charge us for anything. we got back fine and i've since had my local mechanic here work on the issue. 

this is a sign of a place you can trust which is why i am writing the review. if you live in las vegas and own a honda, give this place a try!"
551,positive,i had a minor issue with my muffler. needed to get it fixed asap and i am so elated that i stumbled across this shop. my experience was awesome from start to finish. both tamara and phil were helpful and honest. i will not only be a regular customer but will refer anyone and everyone that needs auto work done.
552,positive,"this review is long overdue! i thought i had already written it, but apparently in the craziness of finals i forgot. anyways, onto my review...

after driving back from california a couple months ago, my check engine light came on and my car was shaking like crazy. upon referral from a friend, and after reading all the yelp reviews, i decided to bring my car (honda crv) into valley automotive. boy was i glad i did! i got an initial estimate from kc and his staff, but after doing some work it ended up that there was more wrong with my car than was initially thought. however, rather than me having to pay for the additional fixes, kc offered to foot the bill! i was shocked, but forever grateful! the thing that sets valley automotive apart from most other auto shops is they care about their customers and want to do right by them. as a graduate student with little money, i appreciate the honest business and work that kc and his staff do at valley automotive. i happily referred a friend to them so she could get a second opinion after taking her car to another shop. valley automotive saved her money and she was equally as impressed with the service she received!

apparently my car doesn't like the vegas heat (who does like 115 degree weather?!) and i noticed that it is leaking coolant. i will gladly be taking my car back to valley automotive and doing business with kc and his team again!"
553,positive,"i was surprised when i came here because i usually expect to be upsold. im usually given the song and dance that brakes are bad, shocks are on their last limb yada yada yada. when i came in today jeff was a straight shooter. got my oil and transmission fluid changed and he was honest and told me everything was good. they have windows to the shop where you can see the mechanics doing the work. coffee, donuts and a nice lounge area. i like finding a place i can get work done that's trustworthy and jeff (the store manager) is friendly and an asset to big-o."
554,positive,"came in with exhaust pipes rusted halfway off, was prepared to replace the whole thing. guy welded new pipes on just past the muffler. pipes secured now."
555,positive,"we've been taken our cars here for years and they've provided excellent service every time. we've serviced our volkswagen passat and jetta here and they've done an honest job. recently we purchased a used volkswagen tiguan and took it in for a $130 full inspection and the owner frank called me personally and encouraged me to return the vehicle to the dealer due to multiple issues including the transmission which we ended up doing. he didn't charge me at all because they spotted the issues pretty quick into the inspection. i've never seen a mechanic be so honest. 

on another occasion we had a set price set up for a secondary air injector to be installed on my wife's jetta and it turned out they were able to get a cheaper price on the part needed and lowered the cost that we agreed upon. 

i couldn't be more happy with the honestly and high level of service that desert car care chandler provides."
556,positive,"nobody likes getting their car repaired, especially when the damage was someone else's fault.  these guys did a fantastic job on my jaguar f-type.  casey gave me a comprehensive quote and completed the work right on time.  they made sure to repair it right, replacing the parts that needed to be replaced instead of repairing plastic parts like the insurance quote felt could be done.  i also had them perform a paint-less dent repair while the car was there, and the results are impressive, can't even tell it was there.  car was nice and clean for pickup.  if you need repairs, stop searching, this is the place."
557,positive,"these guys rock! quickest most affordable muffler, exhaust, and service shop around! i've taken them all my vehicles for years and would recommend them to anyone."
558,positive,"our porsche's windshield cracked due to a stone on the road, so the porsche dealership in vegas recommended us chris from agr windshields. they got the new windshield ordered (porsche windshield specifically for our gt3 model,) and chris installed it on a sunday on labor day weekend (talk about service!) we were on a roadtrip so sunday was the only day we would be in vegas, so he really did us a huge favor. 
the end result looks amazing, chris is friendly, professional, and a real detail-oriented guy. we were very nervous about a third party fixing our windshield (although recommended by porsche) but we couldn't be happier and you couldnt even tell we did anything. 5 starts!"
559,positive,"i have a 1991 vw westfalia, with a tiico engine covnersion (water-cooled jetta engine, installed ""sideways"").

about a week after getting it out of the shop after the new engine was installed, the the pipe that connects to the in-side of the muffler cracked through. i took it to mesa muffler and they welded it up. about a month later it cracked in the same place again, and they welded it again.

later, when my girlfriend backed the muffler into a dirt bank, it cracked the pipe clean through in the same spot. so i took it to a midas (was out of town - it was my only option), and they installed a new muffler. a few months later the pipe cracked in the original spot. i was back home then, so i took it to a different midas, and they welded it up, and added a new support bracket. that lasted a couple months, the the pipe cracked in the original spot, and the bracket they added also broke off.

took it to a different midas, and they installed a new muffler / bracket assembly, for about $240.00. about 2 weeks later, the entire muffler fell off while i was driving down the highway. :)

so i googled ""high performance muffler,"" and found scottsdale muffler. thank god. i spoke with chris - gave him the whole story, and dropped it off. he called the next day to pick it up, and the bill was $180.00. 

the new muffler / mounting hardware is absolutely a thing of beauty. they fabricated a big flat double-mounting bracket, which is rubber insulated. i could not recommend them more highly!"
560,positive,"you can't ask for better customer service! i took a transmission here to change it from a 2-wheel drive output shaft to a 4-wheel drive output shaft. the price was very reasonable. here's where the great customer service came in:  i made a mistake on the type of 4-wheel drive output shaft that i needed for my application. pete changed out the output shaft at no charge because he had already charged me for the first exchange. with that kind of great customer service, you can't go wrong."
561,positive,"i am not from the area and needed a check engine light to be looked up before i drove home. these guys took me right away.  i sat in the waiting area for an hour while many happy costumers went through.  jr was very friendly, honest and helpful with everyone.  i heard him tell people when they really needed to get something fixed or when they could put it off.  i even heard him consoling a woman who had just broken up with her boyfriend.  she was most worried that it might also have ended her mechanic relationship. 
in the end he didn't charge me for the engine code look up, and said it was fine to drive on.  he also did a great job explaining why the carburetor wasn't an emergency situation.  i could drive home and just see if it comes back on. they did change my oil, which was overdue, for less money than i usually pay.   
like the previous reviewer, if i was reviewing a coffee shop i wouldn't give it any stars but this place was the best mechanic experience i have had."
562,positive,"we were lucky enough to find quick muffler this past weekend (they were open on holiday monday!). our muffler was in need of repair, and had gone to a big name shop for a quote. it was very high, so we thought we'd check out some other places. that's when we came upon quick muffler. they were fast, friendly, polite and half the price of the large chain repair!!! we were in and out in an hour, and were so very thankful. highly recommend this great place! we will be going back for any of our auto needs from here on! thanks abe! you're the best!!"
563,positive,"feb 2013 - p.s.  it's almost a year later, and knock on wood, but my transmission is still running fine.  i have not needed a new one yet!"
564,positive,"we have a 2000 volvo, check engine light flashing. it turned out to be a complicated problem. at the end of the day sammy and team came through above and beyond. the only reason i didn't give them a 5 is i felt they could have called and kept us updated when they didn't meet their time commitments and it  took 3 different trips to resolve the problem and they didn't ensure the check engine light was turned off after they completed the work. they took care of us given our time and troubles. i felt they went out of there way to make the situation right. exceptional! we will continue to use them and refer to people to them. thank you sammy!"
565,positive,"i took my car in to repair a dead headlight. the car has some other issues, but i only had an hour and frankly wasn't prepared to pay for the bumper and transmission work that it should probably have. but a missing headlight means tickets from the po-po, so you gotta sort it out.

i left my car with them, walked out of the shop, and realized that i had forgotten to ask how much it would cost. i'm still new to this whole car thing and make amateur mistakes all the time. i came back after an hour expecting to be reamed, but was handed a $19 bill. i know replacing a headlight isn't a big job, but $19 was waaaaay less than i expected. pretty sweet.

two days later my girlfriend was being cheeky, asking whether i ever got that broken bumper fixed. playing along, i told her to look for herself. she knew i hadn't taken it to the shop - she just wanted to rile me up. but then, to my utter disbelief, we found that the bumper had been fixed. when woodies replaced my headlight (for $19) they also reconnected my sagging bumper. they didn't charge me for it; they didn't even brag about it.

what the hell, woodies. you are too awesome."
566,positive,"after having a transmission noise that was very difficult to pin down, their tech andy was able to square away a tough situation. i was almost out of warranty when i initially brought it in, but with the help of dave drouin(my service advisor) and dave bartlett(service manager) it was covered even though it ran well past my warranty expiration in getting it fixed. dave b in particular was very empathetic and even gives out his cell for texting purposes. dave d was very prompt in getting me the updates to how my vehicle was doing and i would definitely recommend the dealership. even taylor, the loaner vehicle gal was extremely courteous. once again, can't say enough about tech andy. he was phenomenal in trying to understand the problem with the trans."
567,positive,i would highly recommend this dealership based on my recent service experience. the check engine light came on my 2014 limited and i was getting ready to ride from phoenix to california. the service rep. (joe) took care of me. he identified the problem and found the parts at another dealership. had the parts transferred and installed them in a few hours. they provided me transportation to and from my home. could not of received better service.
568,positive,"i hate shops.   i really do.   i have never had a good experience at any auto shop i have ever been to.  i trained myself to work on my own cars so i would never have to deal will shops again. i recently bought a beater truck (1996 dodge ram) for work and/or hauling guitar equipment and what-not.   the truck barely moved.  i maybe got to about 30mph and it revved to about 2000....    i couldn't figure out what was wrong, so i limped this green monster to desert car care. i was expecting the usual...  a phone call about an hour later telling me i needed thousands of dollars worth of work on my truck.  not the case.   they called about an hour later and told me i needed a new battery (which i did) and they gave me the option to buy one my self and bring it to them (the cheaper option) or put one they have there in it ( the easy option).  after that was sorted, they called back again and told me my catalytic converters where clogged and needed new ones.  nothing else.   i even made mention of a possible bad transmission (that gave them an opportunity to screw me) and he said no.  the tranny is fine.  wow.   i couldn't believe how honest they where.  the truck was done the next day and he called me and told me to come pick up ""truck-a-saurus"".  when i got there, the mechanic that worked on it talked with me about later work on the truck getting it to 100% as he is proficient in mopar vehicles.   i will definitely be taking truck-a-saurus back to desert car care to get him 100%.   nice work guys.  keep it up.  this is how a business is supposed to be ran."
569,positive,"stop by here whenever i need supplies for my car. it's convenient because it's located near my house and they have plenty of parking. the employees are pretty knowledgeable here and will assist you in installing batteries, windshield wipers, and other easy things that you can buy here if you need help with it. you can also get your battery tested or check engine light scanned for free. pricing is pretty reasonable on most things and if you shop here a lot make sure to sign up for the rewards card where you get a $20 reward after 5 $20+ transactions in a 6 month period"
570,positive,"just a few days ago my transmission started slipping a bit. then on the 101 it started making some very nasty growling noises. got into a parking lot and every gear acted like neutral; my transmission was toast!

looked into a lot of different shops and was really starting to question if i should even keep my van or just get a new one because of the high costs everywhere i called for rebuilt transmissions.

i heard about pete's transmissions from a trusted mechanic. because of their reviews on yelp and a few other places i decided to go for it. 

when i called, erica answered the phone. she was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions to my satisfaction. when she learned that i drove a van she immediately asked if it was a work van. i said yes and she quickly figured out what it would take to get it done as fast as possible so that i can keep working. my van is my office, warehouse, workshop and lifeblood of my business!

i had my van towed to pete's transmissions on a thursday afternoon. friday morning erica called me letting me know i was good to go! very good turnaround time! my transmission repair included a 12 month warranty and was half the cost of most other places i called!

when you show up at pete's transmissions it is clear that they know what they're doing and they do it well!
my old van is driving better than ever before!"
571,positive,i honestly love this muffler shop. i have been to three others and scottsdale muffler has been on the ball with everything i needed. not only did they do a stand up job of replacing my piping to 2.25 inches and adding a muffler. i wasn't quite happy with the volume so i bought a new muffler and asked them to replace it. they were more happy to do it and they also continued to update me on the progress. amazing prices with amazing service. scottsdale muffler is my muffler shop!
572,positive,"great place.  got a groupon initially for a year of unlimited oil changes for $35 and it was so worth it.  i go every 3,000 miles and have so far been a half a dozen times.  they are thorough with my car and do an inspection with the oil change.  they gave me free estimates for a leaky transmission and the prices compared just fine with other places in town.  i have subsequently bought a groupon for my friend as well."
573,positive,"i found myself needing a new transmission in my 2002 gmc envoy two weeks before christmas. i called pete's and their price was so much lower than other places that i decided it was worth the drive from mesa. when i called back to let them know i was coming, the transmission they had for me was already sold. erika had one put together for me. she told me it would be ready at 8. when i showed up at 8, i walked into an office full of random pictures and art. pete wrote up my paperwork while someone else loaded up the part. the price was exactly what i was told on the phone. i was in and out in 15 minutes. i will definitely recommend pete's to anyone with transmission needs. this place is a family owned operation that has been done right."
574,positive,"very professional and they have fair pricing. they make recommendations that are needed but aren't pushy.  the last time i was in they were able to get me in same day and it was exactly as they had quoted. in addition, they usually are finished before the time they estimated.  i've just stopped by for questions and they were very helpful and even added fluid  or reset check engine light at no cost.  they are super nice there."
575,positive,"love this place i needed a new cat for my cadillac, and places were charging me ridiculous amount of money, jesus and his team took care of me and it was fantastic service i highly recommend this place for anyone with their exhaust or muffler needs!! i will be back!!"
576,positive,"i have used this auto shop a handful of times and they are always super nice, super helpful and not pushy at all. last time i was there was for a check engine light, they told me it just needed to be fixed before my next emissions test, which was a year out. it was an expensive fix so i am glad i have time to save up for it. they could have lied, like may auto shops have done before and told me it had to be done sooner than later, but they are honest! thanks whitey's!!!"
577,positive,"i had my truck (2002 chevy 1500 auto transmission) fixed at petes, great customer service,  unbelievable price (super low )trust me you will not regret it, the shop looks awesome, 
and they aren't bogged down with other non transmission repairs,
 i will only go to  petes from now on and refer everyone to petes transmissions, he will give you a great quote and a great price, i can't say enough good thing about pete, but you are the man, thanks to pete and his creww....."
578,positive,"i'm new to the phoenix area and had car trouble on the i-17 during rush hour. my check engine light was flashing, which i figured was not good, so i checked yelp and found dave's. i chose them because of the reviews and also the fact that it is near my house. they've gained a customer for however long i remain in the area! i took my car in around 10:00am, they said it would be a bit before they could diagnose it, so they gave me a ride home! by noon they called me and told me what was wrong, how much everything would cost, and to my surprise-- that it would be finished before closing the same day. they were friendly and quick. i highly recommend dave's car care! oh and the actual dave (the owner) answers the phone at the shop. i thought that was a nice, personal touch."
579,positive,"""been here a few times for smog and oil change they seemed pretty honest, so when my check engine light came on in my pathfinder i decided to give them a try. needed spark plugs. i got a great price with good service. they included my passing smog and free oil change with the repair. the lady at the counter was pleasant and chatty. good job guys. ""."
580,positive,"i was involved in a dui hit & run and needed my bumper repaired. ben r. put me at ease. he even explained to me how paint works differently on metal versus plastic, which is why my bumper is a slightly different shade that my body. i had never noticed, and i had been starting at my bumper a lot in anger over this accident! i'm pleased with his professionalism and speed, i was in and out quickly and feel good about getting my car repaired."
581,positive,"everyone from the young lady answering the phone, the gentleman that assigned the technician and the technician phil that looked at my friend's car were awesome.
we were driving from san diego to phoenix to watch some baseball when the check engine light came on and the car began losing power. did a quick yelp search and found this place with a solid 5 stars. 
if we could give them 6 stars we would! they diagnosed the car and assured us we were ok to finish up our trip just be sure we have the car fixed when we get home.
thank you everyone at litchfield auto repair!!"
582,positive,"in solon on business and desperate for good food, i had the good fortune to stumble upon ""harvest kitchen and lounge"".  i went back the next night.  and if i hadn't flown out the next morning i'd have been back again.  

on a busy stretch of road lined with muffler shops and fast food franchises (read ""food like substance"") it would be easy to miss harvest kitchen.  (i did and doubled back.)  you park out back and enter through the rear (that's where the hostess is).  the high ceilinged dining room is decorated in soothing colors.  very airy, very well lit, and not over-chilled - no sweater needed.  it's a handsomely appointed establishment

harvest kitchen has fish, foul and red meat; pasta and vegetarian selections, a long list of enticing appetizers and a above average wine list.  i would say the menu's organizing principle is something like ""north ohio locavore"".  they collect as many ingredients locally as possible, they even found an ohio made pasta.  it shows in the taste.  i had the saffron angel hair pasta with shrimp, chorizo and vegetables the first night; the tomatoes, spinach and shallots really dressed it up.  the ginger shrimp and sesame noodles (with peas, tomatoes, basic and curry) was equally enticing.  

harvest kitchen and lounge is hands down the best restaurant in solon ohio.  that's not saying much, but harvest kitchen would generate positive notice anywhere - in solon (an unexceptional, distinction free suburb southeast of cleveland) it's a real stand-out.  next time i'm in solon i'll eat there every night - no point in looking further afield.  

harvest kitchen would rate at least four stars in any urban center.  but it a distant suburb like solon it's five stars for sure."
583,positive,"i was referred to t jay's by a colleague after a fender bender and was very happy with the service. 

very friendly and professional. their customer service was excellent - going above and beyond most businesses to accommodate me. the car looks and drives perfectly.

if you ever need your car repaired, i highly recommend checking them out."
584,positive,"have had my oil changed here for years now on several cars. always a thorough fluids/filters check. basic stuff is priced right, but upgrades and some bigger flushes and systems services are a tad pricey.

i just happened to stop in today for an oil change after coming directly from the cadillac dealership. had been having trouble with a check engine light, rough acceleration, and a nasty rattling noise. 

somehow the dealership could find nothing wrong and it drove fine for them, yet it rattled and ran rough straight out of their parking lot as i was leaving. decided to go for an oil change and fluid check at terrible's. was in and out in about 30 mins. surprisingly, it ran so smooth on the way home and didn't rattle either. my guess is the tech must have reconnected something that fell loose - maybe a vacuum line or ecm connection?? 

either way, great job today as usual. i also come here regularly for car washes. 
tip: if you buy a car wash at the pump (which you probably need anyways), it knocks off .20¢ per gallon on the gas price. hard to beat."
585,positive,"awesome service and very professional employees that are very helpful, first time here with my bmw, had my srs light and check engine light diagnosed, and also my oil changed. eddie really knows his stuff, thought this place was too good to be true with complete 5 stars rating but it lived up to its reviews as you can see, would recommend this place to everyone who has a german or euro car."
586,positive,"i brought my e92 335i in to bmw for a check engine light. jesse has worked on this car before and each and every experience is outstanding: always knowledgeable, always prompt, and the job is done right.  i won't let anyone else work on my cars. good, honest techs do exist in vegas!"
587,positive,"i have to tell yelp about cars. i am grateful for their quick, professional service and their awesome prices. i recently had the transmission on my 2006 bmw m6 go bye bye the hard way (pics attached) and cars was there to get my car on the road again. i also had a 2001 bmw 740i that had a bad engine that needed to be replaced as well as some suspension work. i had a complete suspension rebuild kit and bc coilovers installed. that along with a new engine installed at cars have made my 01 silver bullet just like new. i couldn't be more happy with the results. 

armando was the lead mechanic ( to my knowledge) on both cars and i have to give him a big thank you. moe is one of the owners and the gentlemen i worked with most. he is very fair and understanding and i would encourage any one that wants a+ work done but doesn't want to pay desert bmw prices to call moe. eddie works the front desk and is always a delight to talk to. the whole shop has a very warm and inviting atmosphere as you would expect from a professionally run , family owned and operated business. i almost can't wait for my next major mechanical failure to go back and see them again.  thank you all."
588,positive,"i had my check engine light come on and took it here. but it just ended up being the gas cap. i should've taken it to autozone first for a free diagnostic test rather than being charged almost $60. i called them again on a different occasion for regular oil change, but was told nobody does the regular oil change anymore and everyone offers the synthetic oil change anywhere i'd take my car to (which is not so true...) the oil change price is a little more than what you can get else where. i recommend groupon for oil change"
589,positive,"i unfortunately had to get my car repaired twice in three years when i lived in cleveland. fortunately, excalibur did the job, which minimized the hassle. this auto shop was recommended by my auto insurance, geico. they had great service, explained everything and kept me updated, and made all the necessary repairs efficiently. they also vacuumed the inside of my car, which was a nice bonus. it was good to have the piece of mind, knowing that they would take good care of my car. 

the only issue i ran into, a few years later, was finding out that they didn't replace the rear bumper quite right, so there is an area where it doesn't attach as securely as it should. it does not affect the function of my car, but if i ever need to get the bumper replaced again (hopefully not anytime soon), i'll have to find a shop to do it correctly."
590,positive,"my car is old and on the verge of death.  the muffler fell off and i needed to remain road legal, so i came in and was helped extremely quickly without an appointment.  the gentleman showed me under my car and explained all the issues i had clearly, and gave me options.  what's more, he didn't try to oversell or lie to me to make a few extra bucks.

the price was fair, and i only had to wait around half an hour while they replaced my muffler.  i left without a hole in my wallet, and with a clear picture of what was going on with my car and roughly how long i had.  very satisfied, and would return here."
591,positive,"i don't know much about cars or anything car related. i know that the vehicle i'm driving is getting on in years and is getting to the point where i'm worried if it will last. found liberty through yelp and i am grateful for all your reviews as they held true.

i took it here to see what could be done with the check engine light. i was taken care of by rashid. his service was quick, courteous and quite educational. i was given a decent quote for the service but had to decline due to lack of funds. he made me a deal that i might take him up on next time when i come back. instead i just got my oil changed - about an hour or so wait which was great timing for lunch at l&l next door. we had some good conversation and i enjoyed my experience. will probably be back soon."
592,positive,"i purchased my nissan at planet nissan and that location has no idea what they're doing. i've had my transmission replaced twice with them and it was no fun. after i got my transmission fixed i went to autonation to get a second opinion and since then everything has been great. i'm not going anywhere else. my advisor chris is awesome! he knows what needs to be done and he makes it happen! 
i will continue to go autonation for my oil changes and car repairs! great job guys!"
593,positive,"schorier was great to work with.  they fixed my check engine light / replaced my fuel pump that another repair shop installed incorrectly. they even offered to answer any of my hubby's questions since he wasn't able to be there.  they explained everything, were friendly and not pushy.  would definitely return again."
594,positive,they were super nice. and i love this place but the prices are really expensive. i know you pay more at the dealership but the transmission tune up will be 400$ that is more than my monthly payment. that is why more people don't have vw.
595,positive,ethical and expert. cm owns the best transmission shop in phoenix. ask him to blow the horns on his custom beetle.
596,positive,"finally, an honest mechanic!  had my car towed to this shop three weeks ago after having thrown a tire rod and was quoted a fair amount for further repairs. took my car in today and watched them turn down working on a transmission because there was nothing wrong with it!!!  what?!  also, a discount for veterans...yay!  great staff, thorough work and honest pricing!"
597,positive,"i was impressed! i had a coupon for a part synthetic oil change for under $20 (great deal). i know my car, so i know when people are trying to sell you bs repairs, i didn't get anything pushy here, just a rec to change the transmission fluid (which is accurate) only downside is that they are very busy on a saturday. no appointment, you are leaving your car there all day. but hey, being busy is a good sign right? also, appts have to be made days in advance, not the day before like i tried."
598,positive,"my ""change oil"" light was on and i knew that i have been driving around too long.  i dreaded going and having to wait a long time.  i was passing by and seen the ""now open"" sign.  i drove up and services was quick!  the staff was very professional and conner was attentive to our needs and concerns about the type of oil we were wanting.  we will be back to have our transmission fluid change!  thank you"
599,positive,"while i did not actually get work done on my vehicle, i can attest that these guys are trustworthy. my vehicle's transmission began slipping several days ago. with some online research of my car (ford exploder), i feared the worst. sure enough, kevin from park auto called me and gave the bad news that my trans had failed and explained why. while his price quote to fix the problem seemed competitive to what others have paid for this repair, i decided that the it was not worth fixing the vehicle. kevin also did a full inspection of the vehicle and agreed that with everything else that was about to need repair on the vehicle, it was probably not worth keeping the vehicle. 

perhaps the best thing to happen in this crappy situation was that park auto declined to charge me for an inspection because kevin stated they did not believe that charging every chance you get is how you keep returning customers. so just with that alone, they have earned my business next time i am inevitably in need of car repair. good work park auto clinic!"
600,positive,"my grandfather is a ford dealer, but his shop is 2 hours away. needless to say, i don't trust many people to work on my car (as i've been screwed by other dealers in the past!), but sometimes i just can't make the drive.

so when my friend les noticed that my car was leaking transmission fluid (!!!) this weekend, he told me to call kayser for an appointment. they were very friendly (no dumb girl treatment) and got me in as soon as they could. thankfully everything was under warranty and didn't cost me anything. they had my car ready in less than a day. i would definitely take my car back to them."
601,positive,"allstate transmission and auto repair inc., is the only transmission shop i trust to have my fleet of ford e350 vans maintained and repaired. 

they explain your options and work hard to get it right the - first time! they give you accurate estimates of the cost and the time it takes to work on your vehicle. i am glad to know that quality comes at a reasonable price!"
602,positive,"tempe transmission went above and beyond to help solve my transmission problem and did it reasonably fast keeping me informed all the way.
i strongly recommend them for any owner of heavy duty pick up truck that has transmission problems"
603,positive,"i backed into my trash can and bent the muffler, i also needed an oil change. henry was so helpful and they were very accommodating, had me in and out within an hour, and i was able to work on my laptop as they had a desk and free wi-fi. exactly what a busy lady needs. i'll be coming back for sure!!"
604,positive,"going to a new mechanic to get your car repaired shouldn't rank up there with public speaking and first dates, but it usually does.  well not if you go visit tim at walter's.  they guys at walter's are friendly, trustworthy, and treat you with respect.

they are a small shop so call ahead if you need major service, but where else are you going find a mechanic who actually suggests way to save money on the repair"
605,positive,"my family and i pushed my 2009 nissan altima pretty hard from san francisco to las vegas and about 70 miles outside of vegas, my transmission went into safe mode. needless to say my family was beyond stressed out about this. the next day i took it into nissan and dario and his team were phenomenal! i explained my situation and he really with the extra mile. i can't say enough great things about dario and my overall satisfaction with the customer service, professionalism, and efficiency of this branch. my family and i thank you for making our experience in las vegas and enjoyable one and not a stressful one. thank you!"
606,positive,"we tried it based on yelp reviews, and are we ever glad that we did!  my husband ordered the pad thai and asked for level 3 and the papaya salad at level 5 - ""thai hot"".  i ordered the sauteed vegetables with garlic sauce (came with rice on the side) at heat level 3.  we loved what we ordered, although i will admit that next time i will order heat/spiciness level 2 for myself.  i have to commend them:  the spiciness was not just ""hot for hot's sake"", but had real depth of flavor.  i will also say that the mango smoothie we had for dessert was the perfect calming point for my palate.  the restaurant was peaceful, lovely.  we were at a bench/table.  one really neat feature:  there was a large group dining in the side area and there are pivoting glass divider panels that the staff used that really cut down on sound transmission.  what a great thing to have.  i agree with other postings, it is not inexpensive, but i thought it was good value for the quality of food, service, ambiance and location.  we will return the next time we are near bally's"
607,positive,"honest mechanics and they do more than just transmissions. jim has replaced my clutch, brakes and fixed a dying water pump. this is a relatively new location but they have been in business for over 30 years in las vegas. i send all my girl friends here because i know they won't get screwed over. highly recommended!!"
608,positive,"small family owned shop but great at what they do (dad and brother both retired so now it's just kevin i believe). we've had kevin work on our vw beetle for a few things and couldn't be happier. super, honest, great guy. we were having a transmission slipping issue and called/visited several places. those that would actually work on vws said i'd need a new/rebuilt transmission. called kevin up and have him there basics and he was like ""oh yeah, it's probably doing this and this right?... i know exactly what wrong. it's probably just a valve body that needs to be replaced. see it all the time. you shouldn't need a new transmission."" ran me about $1750 instead of the $3500-5000 i was quoted for a whole new transmission by several other places. had it done in like 2 days. even called me a week or so later to find out how it was running and if everything was still ok! had something else wrong where he looked at it, said he thinks it's x which would run several hundred dollars, but wanted another day to take a second look if i was ok with it. called me the next day, said he finally found the issue and it was small, only like $150 give or take. extremely honest and trustworthy. the only down side is he doesn't take credit cards (or at least didn't when i had my work done). but i'll figure out a way to pay cash or check to an honest, good mechanic over credit to a questionable/unknown one any day."
609,positive,i was really happy with this restaurant! we stumbled upon this when we were getting our car repaired and decided to stop and enjoy lunch. there were about a half dozen folks in there during the lunch hour and everyone seemed to be a mix of business and local families. initially the service was really slow i'm not sure they were fully staffed but further into the lunch hour more employees showed up and everyone was a delight. the food was delicious and there was plenty of it! i recommend the shrimp!
610,positive,i recently took my car to national for a check engine light issue.  i was on a tight timeline due to the fact that i needed to pass emissions and register my vehicle.  they replaced my computer and took my vehicle through emissions to guarantee that there were no issues.  i am thrilled that they completed my work on time and for a great price.  i will definitely return again.
611,positive,guys at cars nv are awesome heard nothing but great things about the shop.  brought my mkv gti in because the check engine light was on and the car was running sluggish.  they located the problem and fixed it quickly and for a great price!  my gti runs so good now!  pulls like a freight train again.  what really won me over about cars nv was the amazing customer service & price.  thank you cars nv crew for the great service and experience see you guys next month for my timing belt/water pump install.
612,positive,"excellent work at a very good price from this clean,  professional shop. jesus had me in and out in 20 minutes. outfitted my 1984 f150 with a  new high quality truck muffler that i would be unable to find at the price i paid anywhere else.  glad i traveled all the way from  cave creek to  this great  shop.  thank you,  jesus!"
613,positive,"hey trust me when i tell you....you will receive 5 star treatment at this midas on bell road. located only about 1 min off sr51 here in phoenix...it is you one stop destination for everything that is ailing your car, truck, van, suv, or motorcycle. i remember when i first moved out here in feb..i had some serious issues going on with my 1999 jeep cherokee classic. my wife and sister-in-law drove our jeep from chicago illinois, more than 2000 miles, and i have to say it made it all the way with no troubles to speak of. 

however upon arriving in arizona, i noticed a few days later that the check engine light was on....and i knew i needed to rectify any problems i was having with the jeep before i took it for it's emission test out here. well to make a long story short...being new out here i didn't know who to trust to fix my trucks....also own a 2004 chevy colorado....and i had heard some true horror stories about how car mechanics try to swindle you out of thousands of dollars out here.

so since i needed an oil change i decided to go to midas and at least get that done since they were offering to rotate the tires as well all for only 19.99. while i was there i had them check out the check engine light...and check for anything else that was wrong with the jeep  again before i took it for the emission test. i have to tell you it was the best decision i have made for my trucks since i arrived here. 

bob ostercamp who is the manager at this location has consistently given my great deals on all my automotive repairs. he is honest, direct, straightforward, and most importantly he cares how your vehicle runs. he has a great staff of certified mechanics and you can trust they will always do the very best job. this location gets a lot of repeat business because of all these factors.

so if your ever in need for honest, reliable, and great service please visit these guys...i promise you...you won't be sorry. take care my friends!!!!!"
614,positive,"i took my beetle in because the check engine light was on. i scheduled it in the morning and they gave me a lyft home. they ended up changing and sensor and when the car was done they offered to get me a ride back to the shop. that night the light when off again and i called them in the morning and they scheduled an appointment with me at my conscience. the second day they gave me rides, just like the first day. it turns out a second sensor needed to be changed and they didn't charge me at all. the people who worked there treated me like family. car troubles can be such a pain but with them it went so smoothly. i would highly recommend them."
615,positive,"my late-model bmw had a couple issues, because it'd been stored while i was in europe for a couple months.  the battery had died, and the check engine light (""service engine soon"") was on.  you can't get a car registered in clark county with a check engine light on.  i took it to the dealer thinking it was all pretty routine.  the service rep at the dealer quoted me an eye-popping price just to change the oil and diagnose the problem (i'm talking hundreds, just to change the oil and diagnose my electical/emission problem), and i told him no way and drove away ticked off.  

on the recommendation of a friend, i called fred.  he gave me a next-day appointment.  the place doesn't look like much, but fred met me in the parking lot, listened to the problems, offered me a bottle of water, and said he'd have his guys dig into it.  3 hours later, my car was perfect again, and i paid less than half of what the dealership wanted.  oil changed, problem fixed (corrosion on a connection), and check engine light reset.

but here's the kicker.  there was an issue where fred said, ""you might have x problem (electrical/emission), and if so, it's going to be expensive to fix.  but we did y, and l think it's ok now.  so drive it a bit, and if the check engine light stays off after a week, it's fixed; if not, bring it in.""  

3 months later, the car is 100%, and fred's honesty saved me hundreds compared to the dealer.  check engine light has not come back on, and i passed the smog check.

changing the oil on a late-model bmw is a pita if you do it yourself.  and the dealer charges a fortune.  family auto care is about 60% of dealer cost and only about 10% higher than diy, assuming you have the little special tools.  fred uses bmw-spec oil and buys it by the barrel.  you can't beat that when doing the oil yourself, because the oil is spendy.  i ran the numbers and decided it's cheaper for me to have fred change my oil than to do it myself.  needless to say, we're talking about half the dealer cost.

you gotta have a reliable mechanic if you own a car you want to keep.  this hole-in-the-wall gets my thumbs up."
616,positive,"my baby decided to have transmission problems the same time my back went out.  big jim (and yes he is as big as his name) was more than willing to work with me.  he came highly rated from my mechanic.  
now my baby runs better than ever before.  and it was half the cost of taking my car to a dealership for repair. - don't go anywhere else.  i learned my lesson"
617,positive,"well it is a midas.  both myself and girlfriend have had work done on our cars here.  they are pretty honest and fair about prices and trying to help you out when it will be a large job.  they actually show you the parts and why it is bad. paul the manager works almost all the time, and you can tell he cares about the location.

small cons are the oil changes seem to be routine given the price and what is listed as the ""checks"".  also our car was taken in with a check engine light and a specific part that would have cost $400 to fix at midas.  after looking on autozone.com the part was found for $70 and installed with one screw.  they had it listed as an hour part.  i was not happy to find this out.

overall though one of the more honest repair shops."
618,positive,"i took my beetle in because the check engine light was on. i scheduled it in the morning and they gave me a lyft home. they ended up changing and sensor and when the car was done they offered to get me a ride back to the shop. that night the light when off again and i called them in the morning and they scheduled an appointment with me at my conscience. the second day they gave me rides, just like the first day. it turns out a second sensor needed to be changed and they didn't charge me at all. the people who worked there treated me like family. car troubles can be such a pain but with them it went so smoothly. i would highly recommend them. 

update: i took my car in again for something completely different but just like the first time the staff was really nice. if i could i would write them another review because this is a genuine group of people!"
619,positive,"the 'check engine' light went on in my jeep, and after taking it to autozone to have the code read they told me there was a problem with my transmission. i called allstate because they had such good reviews and they definitely did not disappoint. they got me in the very next morning, and even though the problem was actually not the transmission they explained what was wrong and told me where to go to have it fixed. he spent extra time to make sure i understood what was going on so that when i went to the dealership they wouldn't take advantage of me. such great service, and i really appreciated them!"
620,positive,"i was on a road trip to las vegas from san diego knowing i had 1000 miles left. i had my vehicle serviced about a month prior and clearly was not topped off during my service. i failed to get it topped off before my trip my mistake. i had several warning signs my car won't start once i run out of fluid. i came to autonation in las vegas and jeffrey lopez service consultant was so helpful and kind. he told us exactly how much to buy and showed my husband how to fill the tank. 

jeffrey made our day and gave my husband recommendations on golf courses. he provided superior customer service and turned a unhappy customer to a happy one! he deserves kudos from management!!!

not often to find a pleasant, happy to be at work on a saturday very often!!!"
621,positive,"i had my car repaired here through my insurance. had heard horror stories about repair/rental places not keeping you updated so as to trick you into paying for rental longer and other hidden fees. as you can imagine i was on edge going in, but to my surprise everyone was extremely friendly and quick! it was no hassle for me whatsoever and they kept me up to date on the progress of the repairs and let me know as soon as it was done! would definitely come back for future fixes! everyone i dealt with was professional and very friendly!"
622,positive,thank you tony and noe for your great service. i took my 2004 ford explorer to tony with a transmission problem. he was able to fix it and was able to have it ready before i left to california as a special request.  he was such a great help.  so honest and respectful. i won't think twice in coming  here for my next car repair.
623,positive,so i got screwed buying a car on craigslist and ended up having transmission issues right off the bat. i brought my car into allstate transmissions and they diagnosed my vehicle for free with no appointment. turned out it needed a complete transmission rebuild. they completed the repairs a day earlier than expected and they did a great job. sadly the light came back on the next day but i brought it back in and they corrected the issue immediately. thank you mitch nicole and jeff for all your help. i will definitely recommend your shop to anyone i know needing transmission work.
624,positive,"i have taken multiple vehicles here at the recommendation of curt from shadow mountain automotive.  i was extremely pleased with bill and state to state.  i've also sent my secretary here as well, and she had the same experience i did.  bill has never steered me wrong, and he always does right by me.  i am just about to leave to go take another truck to him to get a brand new transmission... it is such a good feeling to know that you have a transmission shop that you can trust, that will be fair with you.  thanks bill, for the old school service/business ethics."
625,positive,"came here for the second time to get several vaccines for an upcoming international trip. first, the lady on the phone who i talked to when scheduling was very helpful. she explained how the process worked, and was very supportive in squeezing my partner and myself into a single appointment. 

upon arrival the building is inside of a strip mall. the waiting room is quite large and very clean, with lots of informational brochures and an informational video on vaccines playing on the tv. we were directed to check in on the computers in the lobby (which for me, was a refreshing change compared to filling out five pieces of paper for the registration paperwork). 

we were quickly escorted back to see the nurse practitioner who was also incredibly friendly. she walked us through what our options were, and even was prepared to offer advice on prophylactic steps to avoid food/water and mosquito transmitted illnesses. this is a great resource for the average person, and i am glad it is offered, however, i think it should be an option. i am one month from being a physician, and did my own research on what vaccines i did and did not need, and the transmission of diseases is not anything new...so it would be nice if you could call and get an appointment just for the vaccines you need instead of having to pay for an appt. with a nurse practitioner. again, it's a great service, do not get me wrong, but it should be optional. 

we were then given our vaccines and prescriptions and sent on our way. travel vaccines can be very very very expensive (it is not that they are expensive here, they are expensive in general). we easily spent over $1300. so make sure that you have good insurance to reimburse you before you go or be prepared to pay a lot of money out of pocket. they do not bill insurance/take insurance, so you must pay and then be reimbursed. 

overall, a great experience, and i'd recommend this place to anyone with international travel plans."
626,positive,"we've had our 2003 boxster s into beck's twice for some major work, and i have to say i've never had such a positive experience with a repair shop! their prices are extremely reasonable, and they do excellent work. 

when we had a problem with 2nd gear on our transmission, the dealership and another shop i called wanted me to replace the whole tranny (about $5-7k!!) but beck's realized it was a common problem and not a difficult fix for their technicians (the guy who worked on my car had spent 5+ years as a factory tech in stuttgart!).

their office staff is friendly, the mechanics will come out and explain what they are doing, and the owner frank is always good about calling if there are any unforeseen problems. contrast that with the porsche dealer in town, i couldn't get the time of day from their ""service managers"" because i wasn't driving a brand new porsche.

i've also referred a friend for his bmw m3, he said beck's charged him much less than the dealership for a major repair, and did a great job. if you own a bmw or porsche and don't take it to beck's, you're doing it wrong!"
627,positive,"i don't have a bmw, neither do i have a ton of money to put into my nissan maxima, but i did want to get my check engine light, smog and brake issues resolved before giving up on this car i bought that i thought was a good deal. after having to spend too much money on an ignition cylinder lock at the dealer, and then told to not bother tying to fix the other issues, but buy another car, i had to find another way. then i found lee. i didn't think it would be practical to fix everything, but to my surprise, not only did lee fix more than i asked (everything), he did it for way less than what the nissan dealer would have charged (if they had the will to do it), and he did it pretty quickly. it's great to have a mechanic who knows what he's doing, and who doesn't lie or cheat, but treats you with honesty, respect and delivers top notch expertise."
628,positive,"thanks to alan and the crew for getting my truck running smooth! they fixed my transmission and drive shaft, you can barely feel the gears shift. don't hesitate to bring your truck or car here, i was from out of town and went here on a recommendation. my truck now runs better than it ever did!!"
629,positive,"an update to my previous review-  this time we worked with andrew in the service department, he took the time to really check out what was wrong and did a transmission program update and flushed the transmission fluid, and tried to really see what he could do to fix the possible problems. the car is running much better, and hopefully these problems will not present themselves again- so thank you andrew. 
as a customer, this is what i think should happen in the first place instead of having to come back several times for the same problem."
630,positive,"i had some car issues, thinking it was the transmission, i dropped my car off on sunday. they called me monday, with an exact diagnosis of what was wrong (throttle position sensor), they charged me nothing and told me how to replace it by myself. saved me hundreds of dollars. thank you guys."
631,positive,"broken down in vegas...sounds like a good country-western song until you live it...towed in your rv.  great staff, extremely competent and reasonably priced repair of a transmission problem in our rialta that another car repair company had created.  love the friendly atmosphere, and we'll be coming back for services in the future."
632,positive,i just purchased a 1970 gmc c1500 and i knew the transmission needed rebuilt. bill and his crew took care of it at a decent price. truck is running fantastic. they fixed everything the previous owner destroyed and even through in some extras. thanks bill!
633,positive,"state to state was recommended to me by another mechanic for my transmission needs.  (a trusted mechanic is the best guy to ask for a referral!)  i first took my 2010 ford f150 to state to state for a leaky transmission.  bill's guys fixed the issue quickly and affordably.  next, i took my 1968 corvette in for a total transmission rebuild and clutch replacement.  again ...  all fixed quickly, perfectly and affordably.  i give state to state transmission my highest recommendation for all of your transmission needs!"
634,positive,a blessing!  my check engine light came on as i was driving into work one morning.  i pulled off 485 and drove to the nearest garage and it was manchester.  the place is very clean and the guys are super friendly.  the customer service is outstanding.  they even were able to drop me off at work and then picked me up once my car was done!  i really felt they had my best interest at heart.  highly recommended.
635,positive,tom hal and glenn these guys are rockstars they worked with me when my transmission went out on my 2004 hyundai santa fe now i'm the proud owner of a 2009 nissan cube i will definitely do business with them again
636,positive,on more than one occasion they have been helpful and honest. one time i went in with an airbag sensor issue. they told me they could fix it but that the vehicle had a recall and the dealer would fix it for free. another time i went in with some transmission issues. i did tell them if it was the transmission i would not repair the car but instead put the money into a new one. they drove my vehicle and determined it was my transmission along with brakes and other problems. they agreed it was a very expensive fix and didn't charge me to look at the vehicle. i will now be purchasing a new vehicle that will have a warranty but as soon as it expires i'm headed back to tuffy for any service it will need.
637,positive,"went to these guys because my check engine light was on and my gas gauge wasn't working. they said we needed a new fuel pump. they had my jeep for about 4hrs and called and said they found broken wires near the gas pump, which was causing the light to go off. basically, our bill went from 600$ to 110$. they could've been greedy and not replaced it and still charged us the 600$. all in all, great customer service. honest, hard working people."
638,positive,was getting the run around from the insurance company i had to deal with to get my car repaired and these guys completely took care of those annoying phone calls and did great repair work on my car. thanks so much for everything guys! especially derrick!
639,positive,"i had come down here since, my honda crv brake pads were spoilt and i had a noisy drive everywhere i went. though it was a walk-in for the service, somehow i could get the car repaired after 4 hrs of wait. anyways, appreciate for without an appointment and getting it done so fast on time."
640,positive,"bill is honest & very knowledgeable. he helped me retrieve my transmission's error codes. so, i could make a claim to the dealership. who repeatedly denied an obvious transmission problem. i was then able to receive warranty coverage. bill saved me thousands of dollars & didn't even charge me for the diagnosis. bill restored my faith in the auto service industry. his pride in workship should be applauded & an example to all who just want to get paid."
641,positive,"i had excellent professional work done by underground diesel.  they installed a new upgraded transmission cooler, banks techo intercooler, banks automind tuner and a complete brake upgrade.  they truck runs amazing and the brake upgrade was better than expected. there labor and parts pricing was excellent.  will be back for more work in the future.  highly recommend!"
642,positive,"whitey's is great. brought my car in for a transmission repair in the morning and they had it done ahead of schedule that evening. the technician also went as far as to offer removing the transmission oil from the bill as they had forgotten to add it to the original quote. great, honest company and staff that offers their services at a reasonable price. if your in need of auto repair this is most certainly my first suggestion."
643,positive,everyone knows how difficult it is to find a trustworthy mechanic.  i just had my 2010 camry serviced today at precision imports and i will definitely return.  i paid about half of what the dealer quoted and most importantly i trust the honesty and expertise from precision.  they serviced the transmission and radiator using oem fluids and did the job right. these guys are true professionals and were very committed to pleasing this customer. thanks!!
644,positive,"after my car broke down in the desert and i faced a gazillion dollar tow charge, i had the wonderful fortune of finding cars complete auto repair online and rated well on yelp. they deserve their rating. a wonderful group all around. caesar was my mechanic. he immediately pulled the top off my motor so that i could see my timing chain and more were slack and screwed. the reason, it turned out, that my timing belt was screwed was because my previous mechanic hadn't torqued down a bolt and it had literally fallen off. caesar not only made all repairs for a good price but saved all the bad parts for me so that i could confront the bad mechanic...then he called the bad mechanic and vouched for the problem. that didn't do any good, but i appreciated his help very much. lastly, he referred me to performance muffler for a great muffler job.  the least i could do was write them a great yelp review, and i will bring them my future business. thanks caesar! and all the other folks who helped out. (no, they are not the cheapest probably, but they are fair and do exactly what they say.)"
645,positive,"i have been coming here for smogs, oil changes & basic maintenance after my free dealership oil changes for 1st 2yrs expired with my current vehicle. 2013 honda civic. 3yr 8mo now. obviously, the $7.77 smog check is the best deal anywhere in the city.  marlene at the front runs a smooth operation. the wait area is fairly small. 5 chairs i believe? a coffee machine, restroom & tv.
i have had 5 oil changes done here in 41.5mo. and smog checks required for car registration annual renewals. so 10 visits thus far. my car uses full synthetic which costs more. usa's price is comparable to other places. i have the type of car that tells you when oil needs changing & other basic maintenance. usually it says to get tire rotation same time as oil change. which are typically complimentary. since my car oil changes seem fairly consistent at about every 8mo. i was not sure if the car's just saying it at regular intervals, the wear has just been consistent or the indicator says 0% oil life before it gets really dirty. i decided to ask a mechanic here what the condition of my oil was. he said i probably could have gone a bit longer before a change. so i asked if it was dirty enough to require a change. he said yeah. you can interpret that how you want.
like many of these auto convenience shops, they do a complimentary inspection of car for preventive maintenance. as you can see on the reviews, there's both good & bad experiences. it should be noted, shops are known to upsell unnecessary services. so one should do their own due diligence. you don't need to be an expert mechanic. but it's good to have at least a basic knowledge of car maintenance or know someone who does. i fall in the former category, emphasis on basic. check your car manual or it's easy to google anything one does not know. isn't the internet a great thing?
my experiences here have been mixed. some services i have been recommended were needed and some were not or not yet. which is the point of 'preventive' maintenance, with exception of services not needed at all or any time soon. a few like changing engine & cabin air filters are easy to do by one's self.(filters which i buy at o'reilly's: see my review for them). watched youtube, did it in under 5min. had transmission fluid changed & fuel injectors/throttle body cleaned 2 visits ago may 2018. to be fair, the mechanic(can't recall name) did say they were not in bad shape but should be done in near future. i did not notice any problems, so it may have been early. but i figured my car was almost 5yrs old 45k mi without having either done ever. and i was offered a deal to get both done so i had them do it.
last visit jan 2019 for most recent oil change & tire rotation. i was recommended air & cabin air filter change(was near recommended change time), front brake pads low(started squeaking a few weeks ago), fuel injector cleaning(odd since they did that 8mo 7k mi ago, with no noticeable fuel economy change before & after the service. and i only use top tier fuel to boot). so they should be fairly clean. side note: top tier gas at arco & costco happen to also be some of the cheapest places to fill up, at least in the sw. i said i could change air filters myself. asked how much left on brake pads. they said don't need to be done right now, but soon for sure. so i replaced air filters myself later on. will get the front brake pads replaced soon. doubtful fuel injectors need cleaning any time in the near future.
overall i would recommend usa. especially for the smog check. just double check on recommended services, as one should with any place you take your car to be serviced."
646,positive,"took my wife's 2008 550i in today for intermittent check engine light and what i thought was suspension issue. i wasn't very thorough in explaining symptoms as i'm not a mechanic but nathan was patience with me.  kameron called me and explained the issue with check engine and provided recommendations for other items they found but did not push repairs on me.  i like the fact that part numbers and labor hours are clearly listed on invoice and estimate.  i only have budgeted for certain repair costs so i didn't do all the recommended items.  i was very surprised that they wash my car and cleaned the interior.  i will return to complete other recommended items.  first class service at reasonable prices.  thanks kameron and nathan, you've gained another customer."
647,positive,"synopsis :  professional and affordable service. the people there are friendly and honest and will take the step further to make everything exceptional. 

i bought a 1998 honda accord from craigslist. my check engine light turned on about two weeks after buying the car. (obviously i'm no car genius) took it into auto zone to check the light and the guy there mentioned mak automotive service. didn't think much of it. talked to an acquaintance that comes to my work and he too mentioned to take it here. too much of a coincidence in my opinion to have two people the same day tell me where to go. so i did. 

walk in and i'm greeted by a smile. very professional yet still with a personality. (i say this because sometimes when i talk to people in a business type scenario it's like talking to a cardboard cutout.) something that i noticed is that everything was clean and organized. even the bathroom was clean. 
left the car there to get checked over. calls me back saying that it has a factory defect and that honda won't cover it because it's over the warranty. gives me a price quote. i lie and tell him to give me a few minutes see if i can come up with the money. so i check the internet, turns out he was right about it and my honda did have a factory defect. call in a few other top rated yelp places and honda and get quoted at least 70 dollars more. i get the job done and my honda purrs like a cat. 

he even changed out a light bulb that was out on my lights for free! i know a bulb isn't a huge deal but it means a lot when they took the time to fix it and even better he didn't even charge me for it. actions like these are what make excellent service into exceptional service. 

since then i've gotten brake pads done here; i got a free oil change out of it. valve adjusted. always been quoted less than other places and i know i can trust them."
648,positive,"this is the 2nd time i came here for my oil change and it's only $12.95 so with tax it comes out to $17.00 which isn't bad compared to other places where they charge $29.99.  they also did my transmission flush for only $69 the first time i came here which is also a good deal.

service is quick, too.  they're conveniently located on rainbow between sahara and oakey and not hard to find at all."
649,positive,"i would recommend this company to anyone!  i don't live in arizona, but i was driving through and my check engine light came on.  being a woman by myself in an unknown area, i was a little nervous- but they were so great and looked everything over.  it ended up being a simple $20 fix and 30 minutes later i was back on my way home without any other problems.  they really could have told me anything and i would have believed them and paid whatever it took to get back on the road, but they were honest and empathetic to my situation.  thank you so much, i wish there was one closer that i could use more often :)"
650,positive,"this is a very true story of how christian brothers automotive works.  they have done a front end alignment,  some rack and pinion work, a full brake job, and some misc other work on my toyota.   after a long road trip, i noticed the brakes were causing a big shimmy on the front end, so also knowing i needed some tires, i had some 70k bridgestones put on and had a brake job done.  i went to rotate my tires at 9k and the fronts were gone, with extreme wear to the inside of the fronts.

i went back to cba and showed them my tires and they were aghast at the wear.  put my car up on the rack and found my tolerances way out.  i had new tires put back on the fronts and had them realign the car again.  my check engine light had also come on and i was in need of an engine sensor.

after i had to buy $425 worth of front tires again, they took responsibility for aligning my car and replacing the sensor for me at no charge.  while many shops would have found an excuse to place the tire wear on me, they did the right thing and really worked with me to ensure i was taken care of.  they ate about $375 worth of work that they didn't have to.

each time i go in to their shop, i am treated respectfully, am communicated with on estimate and finish time, but most importantly, they want to make you feel like a valued customer and want your return business. 

thank you christian brother automotive for taking some responsibility in my cars problem and making me a happy, returning, customer."
651,positive,"i recently traveled to henderson from los angeles for a business trip. upon my arrival my check engine light came on... so i knew i was in for a long few days. the following day after doing some research and reading some reviews on yelp i came across valley automotive. before making my way to my clients home, my team and i picked up a uhaul (which we needed for my client anyways) and dropped off my car. it was instantly in great hands with casey and his team. after checking out my car casey informed me that it was a good ole transmission problem. he communicated with me throughout the process and was very understanding and sincere about my situation. since my car was still under warranty he contacted the dodge dealerships to try and make arrangements for me to get it repaired prior to my return back to los angeles. he took care of everything. :) amazing. once we realized that it was best to just tow my car back to los angeles, he let me store it at his repair shop until i was able to pick it up and haul it back on an auto transport with the uhaul. and if that wasn't enough when i arrived to pick it up his team helped me load it on the auto transport! 

i have never been more grateful for the kindness, flexibility and amazing communication of casey and his team. everyone is always looking for an honest mechanic. a place that you can take your car and trust that you aren't getting ripped off... just b/c you are girl or might not know everything about cars. i found this mechanic in casey and his team. i wish i lived in henderson b/c he would have my  business for life. amazing job! thank you thank you thank you! when i got back to la and had to deal with my dealership here... i felt prepared. 

you have my referral for life!"
652,positive,"service department is great! my family and i just moved to this area and have already gone to the dealership for a routine oil change the in the quick lane and transmission service on our ford edge. hands down the best experience i've ever dealt with from a service department in the valley. blows berge ford out of the water and makes me as comfortable and supported as my great experiences with jim click ford down in tucson. quick lane service is amazing and the whole staff is extremely knowledgable and hospitable even when i am not operating 100% before my coffee kicks in (which you can get right there at the little cafe while you wait). no hassle on pricing. last visit was at no charge even though i had a handful of minor concerns to address. had a rental car provided to my wife at 15$ a day for 3 days while they closely tried to diagnose the issues based on my descriptive sounds and suggestions . in that time they reprogrammed the transmission controls and added a quart to my transmission fluid (not sure why it was low, no leak) and back in a week for full transmission service. also fixed blower/ vacuum leak in my brake system. keeping my family safe on the road. i rarely buy from a dealership and i don't know how the sales side is yet at san tan ford so this review is purely regarding parts and service department. i'm very appreciative of the team there. so far i think everyone's name is eric. i've dealt with two erics and they were both excellent. look forward to taking my vehicle back again and may even look for my ford diesel there rather than private party or small dealership."
653,positive,"above and beyond customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i was referred to allstate by tucker tire (another excellent automotive repair place!) for transmission issues.  i had just purchased a used 2002 dodge 15 passenger van and had it die on me the weekend before heading up the i-17 in cordes junction.  turns out that it needed a transmission cooler installed.  i took it to allstate the next day and they were happy to give me a ride home (approximately 8 miles) while they worked on my van.  i was desperate to get the repairs done quickly and correctly -- as i was headed to colorado the next day.  i'm a professional dog handler and was heading to a dog show with 2 other people and 5 dogs!!  i was nervous when i picked up the van...as i had just recently purchased from a private party that did not keep good records on the repairs she had done -- but i was assured by the guys there that it was a good van and could easily make it to colorado now that it had a new transmission cooler.

well, we got an early start on our trip the next morning and left phoenix about 5:00 a.m. --- made a pit stop at cordes junction to get gas and snacks...and as i returned to the van from the store, i was terrified to see red liquid dripping out all over from the front of the van!!!  in a panic, i called the number on the business card from allstate --- and i was shocked (but in a good way) that jeff wilson (the general manager) answered the phone!!!  it was only 6:30 a.m. on thursday morning!!!  i explained the problem to jeff as well as the fact that we were already an hour outside of phoenix and with 5 dogs in the van -- it was getting hot and i had to get on the road.  jeff was understanding and advised me to add some transmission fluid to get me up the road a bit to the home of the gal that we were picking up.  i had to hang out there for a few hours....but allstate sent a technician all the way to mayer, az to fix the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i have never heard of customer service like this!!!!  i feel terrible that i have forgotten the gentleman's name that came to help -- but he arrived on his motorcycle with every part they could possibly need to fix the van -- turns out it was a faulty cooler and he had to replace that -- which he did at no charge.  although we got an extremely late start on our trip -- i can't say enough about how pleased i was at the way allstate handled this problem.  i plan on using them for all future repairs on this vehicle!!!!"
654,positive,"i'm so glad i was recommended by friends to this place. this was my first time, and i'll be back! i asked in a vw group i'm in and several people said go here, so i tried it and i'll be back. 

i had an issue with my check engine light that another performance place couldn't figure out but london figured it out quickly and fixed it.  they even took my car next door to get the emissions test. they went above and beyond and for that i'll be back. i'm so glad i found an awesome trustworthy european car mechanic. 

customer service was great. prices are great for the level of service. they even have a waiting room with premium channels to help ya be comfy while ya wait. thanks guys! i'll be back around soon!"
655,positive,"the best , most honest mechanic i've ever met . hard working professional . refer as many people to narcisso as possible . i no longer dread having my car repaired ."
656,positive,highly recommend this shop for muffler and exhaust work. i made an appointment and was in and out in only 15 minutes. minor repair for a rubber exhaust hanger was treated with the same service as if i was getting a full system. excellent service!
657,positive,"imagine, driving down 15 south and see the vegas lights and looked down to see a check engine light turn on! bitter sweet entrance to vegas... there was no change in drive quality but to make sure i researched several places around the strip. i decided to go to liberty tech and tire, where i found very professional, trustworthy, and timely car repair. i found that the check light code was for a faulty catalytic converter. rashid gave a very honest solution, where the parts would take 1-2 business days to arrive to vegas because its usually not stocked and informed me that the best option was to carry on and drive my subaru as is.  it turns out that some subaru's activate check lights because of certain atmosphere conditions that vegas have. i took his word and the next day drove back to the bay area and on the way back along interstate 5 the check light went away. till this day, it has not came back. if you are looking for a down to earth mechanic that will give you your best option, this is the place to go to!. rashid's advice save me from getting a costly, unnecessary repair done."
658,positive,"the check engine light came on of the bfs car so we came in for them to read the code. it's fairly simple, quick and free to do at autozone. 

they read the code and then printed us out papers of what it means and items we might need and parts that they  have/ can order and those that they cannot. 

this was way more painfree than asking your stealership to read your car and get hustled for a handful of things that they tell you the car needs."
659,positive,"good service, reasonable, and no hanky-panky on the deal.

i had the brakes, spark plugs, oil changed, and fluids flushed. price was reasonable and anthony even downgraded the cost when the transmission fluid didn't need to be changed.

impressed."
660,positive,great place when my corolla had a problem in the muffler. tony and basil were great in helping me all throughout the repair by finding the cheapest solution and going the extra mile to make sure i left their shop happy! i will definitely return for other repairs as they are both certified by toyota.
