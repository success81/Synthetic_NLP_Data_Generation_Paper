1,positive,okay guys what the hell... did you open up the transmission and fix it or did you put the timming belt back on like just right? it's seriously never ran this great before it used to not shift gears very well at all now it drives like a dream and all you supposedly fixed was the radiator?  i don't believe it my friend. will be back for some more of that magic touch!
2,positive,"mike and the rest of the guys down at 5 star auto repair are absolute lifesavers! if i could give them more stars, i would! after my check engine light came on in my lexus is300, i was praying it was just a bad o2 sensor but quickly learned that the catalytic converter needed to be replaced. after a dealer quote of $4000 (which is more than i paid for the car), i went down to 5 star auto to get a quick estimate. 

not only was i impressed with the price mike was able to work out for me, i was thrilled to be able to schedule an appointment for the following monday (3 days after i came in...including weekend days). true to his word, mike had my is done on time and even went the extra mile to clean my lifetime air filter. the car runs like a dream, and i couldn't be happier! wish i could keep these guys a secret but that would truly be a disservice to the community. thanks, again, mike and the rest of the team at 5 star auto! you guys rock!"
3,positive,"did a muffler delete here with my gti. i highly recommend this shop, russ works pretty hard and knows what he's doing. extremely reasonable price as well as it's much cheaper than anything else around town. easy 5 stars"
4,positive,"i was referred here by another mechanic that did not do transmission work. they where able to replace my clutch in a reasonable amount of time, even though they where extremely busy at the time. the staff and owner is very friendly, open and upfront as far as cost and repair times. 
they worked with me even when we ran into an unexpected issue during the repair. i will use them again for any car repairs that i may have in the future. please be advised that this is a really busy shop, so call ahead and make an appointment."
5,positive,"i have a 2013 ford fusion and unfortunately my transmission broke down.  carlos luna-aispuro was my service advisor and he made a very ugly situation quite bearable and in the end it turned out to be great.  when i purchased my car i bought the extended warranty and as carlos assured me it was the ""mercedes"" of warranties. when my car broke down i was leaving for our summer trip to boston and of course i was panicked about what this might cost me.  carlos assured me that everything will work out and i should just go and enjoy my vacation.  i did and upon my return my car was still waiting to be approved for the warranty and carlos gave me a free loaner which was a 2017 ford explorer.  when my car work was completed i ended up with a new transmission and an additional 12 months or 12,000 mile warranty on all my parts.  to be honest when i first turned in my car i thought to myself ""this car is a lemon and i am going to get rid of this and go across the street and trade it in.""  however, my whole attitude changed when i realized how ford stood by their cars and i walked out of the dealership with my car and a new transmission and zero money out of pocket.  i will be keeping my car thanks to the awesome customer service from carlos and staying with ford because they stand behind their automobiles."
6,positive,"if anyone had told me that i could find an auto repair shop in las vegas that would fix my out-of-town vehicle quickly and fairly, i would have laughed.  after having my car repaired at tony's, i can say i have found an honest, efficient, and reasonable-priced car repair facility in las vegas (sorry charlie, previous reviewer,  but i can't believe you went to the same facility as me)  after having dennis at a-1 tow my car to tony's (dennis and his new hire were very nice), tony called to say that he would check everything out and get back with me.  about 3 hours later, tony said that the car was almost finished and that all the pumps were in good condition, and only the belts and pulley needed to be replaced.  he took the car for an extended drive to check everything out before i tried to make it back home to socal.   i am very impressed with the quality of service at tony's, the reasonable charge for the prompt repair, and have already told all of my friends in vegas.   thanks again tony!!"
7,positive,"my check engine light was on, so i called and then stopped by. bobby diagnosed the problem in a couple minutes, told me what parts i needed, and installed them for free when i went back. what amazing service!

since my car has over 130k miles, a few things have been going wrong lately. next time i have an issue, i will take my car back to 5 star auto repair -- the name is fitting!"
8,positive,"you'll likely be dealing with dale who will be a refreshing change from most shops. he does amazing work and will not charge you a dime more than required to fix your vehicle and keep his shop open. i was quoted over $300 for a thermostat replacement at ted weins took it to specialized auto care and dale did it for $120.50. since the part was actually 120 on rock auto i can only come to the conclusion he charged me 50 cents in labor.... maybe he had an extra or got a deal on them in bulk but either way i couldn't even have done it myself for cheaper considering shipping costs! i can honestly say i have no need to shop around anymore this is my mechanic. also if he can't do it he will refer you to another trustworthy place that can, in my case it was advanced mufflers right up the street which also received a 5 star review from me. last thing, never go to a ted wiens/firestone."
9,positive,i was in a jam and on panic mode after my expedition failed a smog test due to check engine light being on. i went to 3 mechanic shops and didn't feel like i could trust the prices they were throwing out to me. i called purrfect auto repair and spoke with mike. he said bring the vehicle to him and they will try and squeeze me in to their busy schedule. the diagnostic was fairly cheap compared to other quotes i got prior to them and the diagnostic fee goes towards the repairs if you accept the work to be done. they managed to fix the issues and let me pick up my vehicle at the end of the day! i'm very satisfied with the service i received! thank you to all of you at purrfect auto repair! good looking out mike!
10,positive,i got a new muffler put on my new 2015 4x4 dodge ram 1500. i was referred here by 4 wheel part and was extremely happy with my results. they had the muffler put on in 45 minutes with no appointment for an extremely fair price. i am very happy. my truck roars!
11,positive,great shop fast and inexpensive muffler sounds great i had a missfire in my engien that cause my cat to go bad they found out and had it fixed with the mechanic shop next door
12,positive,"brian and his body works team is a first class business.  i would not think of going to another body shop.  they are very trustworthy and really care about their customers. the customer service is second to none!  having your car repaired after an unexpected accident is not a pleasant thing to do.  brian is very helpful in reviewing your options, and keeping you posted on the progress of your repairs.  they even have an online feature that keeps you posted on the repair progress along with costs and pictures of your automobile.
i have told all my friends at work about the body works plus shop and their superior service.  this is also a very clean and safe shop.

you will not go wrong taking your car to this shop."
13,positive,"got an oil change using groupon and was waiting to told of all the things that where wrong with car. that didn't happen, they let me know the state of my brakes and tires and that the check engine light was on. they let me know they could check this if i wanted. i like the fact that they gave me options and did throw out a list  of every possible issue. game room is pretty cool."
14,positive,i took my van in because the check engine light came on.  they ran the diagnostic test and looked at my transmission. they saw it needed replacement. they called the dealership to see if it was covered. it was and they brought my van over to the dealership.  it was my first visit. their helpfulness and honesty will bring me back again for basic maintenance.
15,positive,with c&r tire i have had nothing but pleasant experiences. the other day i thought my truck needed something new in the front end and i was going to shell out a thousand bucks but they took care of me like they always have and tightened my skid plate and replaced my gas cap no more no and no more check engine light my father always took his vehicles there and so will i!
16,positive,i brought in my dodge stratus because i had severe transmission issues. hamid gave me a quote that sounded very reasonable for the work performed. picked up my car this morning and i'm very happy with the result. a bit of a new car feeling again. he pointed out some other things that need attention but without being pushy. i'll come back!
17,positive,"this place rocks! we were on a family road trip through wisconsin when our van broke down not far from madison. i called over a dozen auto repair shops, none of whom would take us in on such short notice with possible transmission issues. then i called wilde east towne honda and spoke with nick moderson-kox in the service department. he found time to inspect our van that same morning and soon discovered the issue wasn't very serious and they could fix it while we waited. they made the necessary repairs, checking in with us often, as we hung out in the waiting area with our three children and our dog. we had been toying with the idea of purchasing a different vehicle so we ended up taking a test drive and looking at some options with chris alexander in the sales department as well. 

although we didn't purchase a new vehicle that day (we needed to get back on the road), we hope to in the near future. wilde honda is located five hours from our house, but we are still talking about going back there when we decide to buy our next vehicle because of the great staff there. i would highly recommend this place."
18,positive,"i took my vehicle to oasis for a transmission flush and a coolant flush today, i was very impressed with the managers (justin) honesty and professionalism. the price was very fair and the work was done in a very timely manner. 
i brought my vehicle in based on the recommendation of some family members, and after this first impression i plan on being a long term customer. every positive review about oasis seems completely accurate based on my experience.
finally, an honest mechanic shop!"
19,positive,"wow...
so, the other day (and this would have to happen after a difficult day, making it more difficult,) i was on my way home when my car started sounding like a rocket ship. 
my old toyota (edging up on 200,000 miles, yep, i drive em hard,) had a blow out in the connecting pipe between the muffler and converter. previously, i'd had folks tell me i needed a whole new muffler system, and i'm not rich, so the 1200 to 1500 they were quoting me was just too much. 
i was sort of desperate, and asked around. after talking to my brother-in-law and doing some research online, i found all star discount muffler...

and was amazed...

all star is located just off of w.130th in an unassuming neighborhood. now, when i headed out there i was told; get there early. they only do things by first come, first serve. no reservations. why?

they're that freaking busy!! (and that freaking good.)
they opened the gates at 8:30 am, and as i and two more vehicles drove in...so did a dozen more. people from all over bring their cars in just by word of mouth, and the mix of people, from housewives to businessmen to even other mechanics shows how trusted these folks are. 

 the place is no-frills; there's some benches in the main office area, and you can wait or come back, but i'll tell you, you don't have to wait long. 

the staff like dave and amy are thoughtful, efficient and what i like about it is that dave took me under my vehicle and showed me what they were going to do and then quoted me a price. 

i didn't need a whole system; i needed a pipe between the converter and the muffler, which was still quite good and didn't need replacing. that was it. 

with parts and labor folks; 40$ and in and out in about 40 minutes. 

again, this is no frills, but they will not gyp you!  i saw testimonials here, on other review sites, and there were a dozen or more on a peg board in the office written on business cards, stationary and formal letterhead. people are thankful for great service and a good deal. 

(heck, while i was there, two guys from other auto places brought cars in to be repaired because they couldn't. :) also, all of their work carries guarantees as long as you keep your receipts, and i've heard they honor the work they do.  

so, if you want to be treated well, and get all star prices, try all star discount muffler for your brake, shock, and exhaust needs; you're wallet and your car will thank you:)"
20,positive,"the best of the best.. my transmission was making a humming noise so i took my car to them to have it checked. to make the story short, they called the nissan dealership and i received a new transmission at no cost despite being a salvage car! i only paid $60 to this shop! they are very honest mechanics."
21,positive,terry just saved me over $4500! i had a different shop tell me my transmission was shot. i got a 2nd opinion from terry's and thankfully he was honest and didn't find anything wrong! will only go to terry's from now on.
22,positive,"i came in yesterday as my check engine light came on while i was driving to las vegas from la.  i also was due for an oil change.  they changed my oil, diagnosed my check engine light and confirmed i was safe to drive back to la on the check engine light all within an hour while providing me a comfortable place to sit and a complementary soda.  i was so impressed i wanted to have them complete the repairs for my check engine light but i ended up needing to  rush back to la.  if i ever find my self stranded in vegas again i know who i will call.  now i have to find a shop near me that i hope is even half as reliable as busy buggy."
23,positive,"these guys are the best !!! honest, dependable, reliable mechanics. they help me out!  they could have made $500 for an transmission. but they said it was fine and didn't charge me. sun auto service."
24,positive,"i'm surprise to read the other reviews on this location. i was in desperate need of an oil change. i put it off way too long. i pulled in on sunday morning at 8:55am and they were ready and willing to take me right away. they open at 9am. i was quoted a price right away. $49. i don't mind because they check air filters, tires, transmission and such. i needed to clean my oil but i waited too long to get it changed and for $13 dollars it's worth it. i definitely needed at air filter was well. my old one was black! also they knew my left driver's side blinker was out and offered to change it for me. luckily i had the bulb in my car and they switched it out for me for $5 bucks. i've never had better service and was out of there in 20 minutes!"
25,positive,"this place is still as good as it gets. i have gotten many oil changes here, and they are always able to fit me in a pinch. today i had taken my car to troubleshoot the tire pressure sensor system, and it is a hard thing to troubleshoot.  they had checked the sensors and could not find why it was happening and recommended me to ford. they didn't charge me for their troubleshooting, which was highly appreciated. 

if you need your car repaired or anything done, i would recommend this place hands down.

every time i have been here the prices have been more than fair and the service has been some of the best that i have ever had. i personally cannot do oil changes and troubleshoot my car in my apartment complex (as it is against their policies), so this is definitely the next best option."
26,positive,"second time to rebel automotive, had oil change and transmission fluid change.  super fast.  took my daughter and we played in the arcade, she had a blast."
27,positive,"sept 17, 2016
at 4 a.m. we were leaving las vegas and as we were 35 minutes out our transmission blew. we called aaa and waited for 30 minutes. during our wait we called several auto places which we're closed due to the day being sunday. then we saw this company busy buggy!!!! they are open 23/7,  i have to say my heart was lifted when this gentlemen said yes! we can get the part and have the truck (1997 chevy tahoe) ready by monday no later then 6 p.m. whew what a relief to hear that. we had free shuttle from busy buggy to the hotel, they have complimentary coffee, drinks, ice cream, and snacks. it made us feel like they understood what we just went through and having something to eat for free was just a way to say it will be okay. in conclusion we are on the road, the truck is running excellent, and we feel safe for the long drive home. 
as for the professional mechanics, we learned that each mechanic are well experienced and they love what they do, fix cars! i give this company a 5 star rating in the categories: customer service (honesty), post performance (transmission installation), and complementary amenities (drinks, and snacks). 
thank you busy buggy and the crew that worked on our 1997 chevy tahoe lt

the marmon's (tracy ca)"
28,positive,"i'm so glad i found an honest and inexpensive place i can take my car to i took my car in for an oil change and a transmission drain +refill, and they finished the job within a couple of minutes. there was absolutely no waiting time because the mechanic was so quick and efficient. not just that, they rotated my tires and checked my tire pressure for free. my car runs better than it's ever run before now. this place is the only place i will bring my car from now on. 
the tricky thing about this place is that it is located behind a few restaurants, so it's a little hard to find."
29,positive,needed a piece of tube bent for a project.  turned out that the tube i had wouldn't bend right with their bender. they had the same size pipe but different type in stock that would work for my project (non exhaust related) they bent it to my specs in just a few mins and didn't cost much at all.  ended up fitting perfect.  thank you pro muffler will be back for a flowmaster in the future.
30,positive,"these guys straight up rock! it's very nice to find a local shop that gives you fast honest estimates that are very detailed. they solve the problem and get the job done very quickly. personal calls from the mechanics to let you know how the job is coming along. everything just seems to go better at crawfords! job done right, fast, and all at the best prices around! i don't go anywhere else. oil change, tune-up, brakes, muffler, tires, or any engine repair...they do it all. check them out next time you need any auto service or repair."
31,positive,was a little unsure as to what was needed with my car. i thought perhaps i needed a whole new muffler altogether which i was a bit apprehensive given i was almost broke but couldn't make it to my job with my vehicle dragging a broken muffler around. when i got there i was told he would try and look at it today as he was short a guy. i called during lunch to see if they'd gotten a look at the car and what it'd need and voila they had it all set to be picked up and they welded the two parts of my dual exhaust back together costing me a total of $40. i had to have him repeat the amount like 3 times because it just sounded too good to be true. i will be a returning customer for as long as i live here. i appreciate your help guys! couldn't be happier!
32,positive,"so, i'm usually never really blown away by most places customer service, but chris and his team at the valvoline on elkhorn and grand montecito nailed it. i had been having some issues with my transmission and wanted to see what was going on with the car. chris greeted me with a smile and listened carefully as i explained what was going on. he not only offered to look at the transmission, but did checks on all fluid levels, belts, filters, brakes and tires. he took the time to explain in detail what he was checking for and what required immediate service and what didn't. i was so impressed by his ethic that i decided to get the work done. not only did he get the work done in a timely manner, he also got me a discount on some of the work. i will be bringing my car back here frequently and highly recommend this location to anyone who values a great customer service experience!"
33,positive,"i brought in our range rover in for service because the check engine light was on.  service agent ana was very helpful and set me up with a loaner car for the day because i had to get to work.  ana called me within 3 hours and my car issue was resolved!  thank you ana for making it a smooth service with my repair!  hope to not be back anytime soon, but if i do, i'll be back to see ana!"
34,positive,"my usually reliable vehicle decided out start acting up the day my hubs & i decided to roll out to las vegas for our one year anniversary. for some reason, it sounded like it wouldn't shift the gear (i have an automatic & i don't know much about vehicles) and wouldn't ""climb"" hills. when we pulled into treasure island's parking garage & the uphill driveway, my car started shaking and lights started flashing. dude. really. 

we waited until the next day (today, monday) & took it in. edward helped us out as soon as he got off the phone & let me know he can diagnose it. then, gustavo pulled up & drove us back to ti - with my car so he can see what we're talking about. nice.

about two/three hours later - ed calls me to let me know there are damaged wires that connect to the computer that talks to my transmission & it's basically telling it it's no good. (i had just received and oil change and tire rotation friday. wish it was caught then) 

$260 to repair. truthfully not that bad, so i called back & said go for it. 

timeline: 

9:30(ish) - took it over 

11:30 - edward called to tell me what was wrong 

12:55 - edward called to tell me it was done. awesome!!! 

1:03 - gustavo's at our hotel. again, awesome! 

we didn't even have to ask to be picked up and expected to have to take a taxi or walk. they didn't even charge for that. 

the owner - i'm assuming from reading reviews, came out to ring us out & let me know what else it needed. i was grateful.

yelp, you did exactly what you were created to do. busy buggy - so did you."
35,positive,"i do not like taking my vehicles to a shop.  but when its 6000 degrees outside, i can't stand being in the garage. joe at sun auto talked to me respectfully, and gave me a diagnosis/quote of my problem early the next day. i am pretty comfortable working on vehicles old and new, and i thought i had already pinpointed the problem as a transmission issue.  if they had told me so, they could have ripped me off easily by telling me i needed a rebuild. "" luckily"" it was brake noise, and required a front brake job.  it was not cheap, but sometimes peace of mind that a job is done right, is worth paying for.  you can probably find cheaper prices, but i will certainly give them business again if i needed help."
36,positive,"i haven't even had my car repaired yet, and already i want to give the hargraves team five stars, but i'm giving them four just to be reasonable. i will update when i've completed business with them. this is the first time i've written a review before my my transaction was complete with a business, but because my treatment has been so good i'm doing a review now. i was involved in an accident (other person's fault) that totaled my car. i had it dropped off at hargraves at the recommendation of my mechanic and every interaction has been professional and kind. the team at hargraves (with special kudos to david and scott) have consistently gone above and beyond to keep me informed and updated about the status of my vehicle. this has been important because the slimeball who hit me was a used car salesman from europa auto sales and when the police officer took his information, he lied about who owned the car and who's insurance was responsible (it's europa's responsibility, but they've been scumbags and won't release their information, so i'll have to get a lawyer *sigh*) fortunately the team at hargraves is a rare example of a business who sincerely works for their customer's best interest."
37,positive,"my old 320ml decided to cause me problems - it was stuck in low range and wouldn't shift out.  i took it to sun devil auto who have done most of the recent maintenance on the suv (very competently i might add) and advertise that they do transmission work.  to their credit, they were unfamiliar about working on an old mercedes and recommended going to a mercedes speciality shop.

i've gone through a few mercedes shops and have had little issues with each, so i decided to try european auto salon on 7th st.  glad i did.

they were able to get me in the next morning.  they tried to find a simple solution, but of course few mercedes' issues are ever simple.  but after dropping me off at work, they called an hour later with the diagnosis and estimate that proved to be right on.

after lunch, the car was ready and i drove away - a little poorer, but happy to have found a new shop i trust."
38,positive,"great service. great prices.  they were able to fix my car within the day. and even offered me a ride back to work. they are very knowledgeable about the german cars. and their prices for their service is on par with other people who do not specialize in german cars. 

so i really feel you're getting a great deal from these guys. if you want your car repaired with authentic oem parts. then these are your guys."
39,positive,"thanks to lamborghini of las vegas (this is a not accurate when they are based in henderson!) i sold my 2010 lamborghini 560-4 spyder to a lambo dealer in ca and i will never own another lambo.  terrible and arrogant sales manager basically laughed at me when i called him about a trade difference on a new aventador lp-700 saying there was no market for my car and he did not have any aventadors unless i paid him $80,000 over the already absurd list price of $400,000 range.  i own a new ferrari california i bought from the penske-wynn las vegas dealer and tony  the sales person and rich the service manager are beyond awesome, opposite of these jerks.  also the ferrari is far superior compared to the lambo with better dual clutch transmission, far nicer interior, vastly superior technology in the gps, monitoring lcds and far superior sound system plus a hard top conv for about the same price as my prior lambo.  i will never sell or trade my ferrari california but when i decide to buy another amazing sports car it will be a new ferrari when they come out with a new model to blow away the aventador!

wayne gorsek"
40,positive,"this is the second time i have brought my car to them.  first time my check engine light was on.  they came out to check it tighten my gas cap and reset the light.  then set me on my way no charge!  
this time my temperature gauge said it was overheating.  drove to their shop and they even drove me down the street back to work!  i was scared it was the radiator and was going to be serious.  got a call that it was just the gauge that was broken and everything else was fine.  they fixed it for a very reasonable price!  it is awesome to find honest mechanics.  most shops will take advantage of people.  will for sure be back!"
41,positive,"my tc light was on and with that comes the check engine light.  that thursday on the way home my engine oil pressure light came on but then went right off.  taking a flight that night, had to wait til i came back.  in the meantime, e's car didn't start on monday so in his went also.  they had to keep his overnight (waiting on stupid warranty ppl).  so tuesday i drive my car to bb and drop it off.  marco is always so pleasant but no matter how sweet he is i'm always scared to my whits end about the cost.  they take e and i to work.  long story short, car had no oil...wtf (i know i know, you think im a girl and don't know any better but that's not true lol  i have a sensor that tells me when to get my oil change but apparently that isn't working).  how is that even possible and why didn't my engine oil pressure light stay on?  anyways, not bb's problem.  gave me an oil change (i was at 4% but clearly that tracking device isn't working lol)  marco called and said everything is fine.  i was 99.99999% certain the tc light would come back on.  i told marco to just go ahead and change whatever.  he said lynette, let's just wait and see.  i was kinda adamant about just changing the sensor and he said lynette i mean i can if you insist but let's really just wait and see.  
welp, it's been almost 2 weeks and it's stayed off (knock on wood).  idk if marco was scared of my tears again lol and said just fix it so she doesn't come back lol or if the sensor was on due to the nail that was in my damn tire.  anywho...what i thought was going to potentially be a $500+ job, turned out to be under $60 :)  and ed's car was also back up and running and we both left w our cars on tuesday.  i can't express enough how honest these guys are and how they do everything  possible to not make the damage so bad!
as always, with sincere thanks and gratitude, lc"
42,positive,"i was incredibly nervous about taking my car to a major chain as i've heard and read many mixed reviews about numerous locations. my experience at this aamco was fantastic though!

larry was incredibly kind and helpful in explaining what was wrong with my transmission, and when it came time to fix it, he ended up charging me the originally estimated cost even though he needed to do a little extra work. 

can't recommend this place enough!"
43,positive,"got a great deal on my new tires.  i just happened to be getting some work done over at the muffler shop in the same area.  i needed new tires too and just walked in, no appointment or call.  we went over the options i chose to put on 4 new bf goodrich adv. ta sports, great price and service, friendly, nice waiting area too.  was done all in the same day as they had the tires at nearby warehouse they just had to simply get them.  did an alignment and car is smooth and tires feel good.  thanks again!"
44,positive,"i live in los angeles and drove out to henderson to visit my brother who lives here. my check engine light came on, i brought my car here just by chance to get it checked out. these guys are awesome, honest and know what they are doing, i highly recommend them!"
45,positive,"i buy a transmission over 1,300 dlls for my mustang they shipped a wrong item after wait  7 day in the middle of the new year holidays but also i consider weather road conditions at this time of the season a lot of snow in many states the thing is mistakes happen  is not a perfect business doesn't matter what kind of business but what is matter is customer service attitude they realize  is a mistake that it has to be fix it maybe not them but it maybe a vendor mistake just because they sold the product is them the one who has to fix the issue. after they make some calls they order other transmission for another vendor they apologize and explain to me that if it was for them they will have the transmission ready in the same day but as a customer we have to understand that are limitations for every situation 
managers are employees as well and they have limitations but what really matter is the effort they put into a customer complain paul the store manager care about his customers same as his employees i could just get my money back and go buy it some where else but it will take days also to be deliver, it maybe send the wrong or broken item as well and even worst who knows it maybe be a good or bed customer service so i just decided to let them order the other from a different vendor

i like this auto zone store"
46,positive,"thanks to yelp, i found this awesome car repair shop.  i have nothing but the absolute best things to say about them.  the most professional, honest and effecient that i have ever worked with.  unfortunately, i just bought a ""lemon"" and 25th st. automotive took some of the pain out this process.  they are just amazing....i knew that the transmission was most likely shot.  they spent the minimum amout of time and money to confirm this and were more than accomodating.  i would bring another car back here in a heartbeat. 

overall, a it's very dismal circumstance regarding my newly purchased used car, but an absolutely fabulous experience with 25th street automotive."
47,positive,"if you visit aamco at the van buren st. location, ask for corey. very knowledgeable and personable. if you have transmission problems this is the guy to go see!"
48,positive,"a while back i took my 4runner in for a transmission estimate because the dealership said that all test came back and that i needed a $3640 rebuilt transmission put in. i took it to oasis since i started doing oil changes there. they said they didn't believe the transmission was the issue but the timing belt itself. they ask if they could pull the covers and inspect inside and yes it was that. i was so pleased to get out for about $550 and my truck runs great. they have all of my future repairs and referrals. thanks guys!

49,positive,these guys are great. i was able to get my jeep cherokee in and out within a couple of hours. price was reasonable for a cat back exhaust with a magnaflow muffler installed. my only gripe is they didn't have anymore stickers... my jeep could always use more stickers to hold it together and keep it from falling apart.
50,positive,"at first i was skeptic if i should take my car there. being i've been scammed when i bought the car from a private seller in the first place. but what the heck! 

the office was extremely clean (and it smelled nice too!) something you might not expect from a repair shop. refreshment bar was well stocked & i mean really well stocked. hmmm, not your typical repair shop again. and they have a clean bathroom! imagine that! again, not typical for a car repair shop. with that said, let's get down to the real deal..

mr. hamid (i'm guessing he's the licensed lead mechanic) was very welcoming. received us timely & was very attentive to our concerns about the car. i was telling him the details & i guess he figured out that i was upset about the car being a junk, he told me they'll check the car out & tell me what's wrong. offered me some refreshments & magazines while i wait. he came back saying something's off with the transmission. what?! transmission?! i almost fainted! man! one thing over the other, quoted me the amount me the amount i expected -- but still i was like, lemme look around..

got a second opinion & boy!! they quoted me 4x as much for the same problem busy buggy diagnosed my car for! long story short, took my car back to them & after 2days, whoollaaa!!! my car started running like brand new!! plus, it included 1 year warranty!!! damn!! one whole year!! i'm a fan!! spreading the word over the valley. this is the to go place if you want quality & honest service."
51,positive,"i took a company van, a 2005 chevrolet express with 300,000 miles in for transmission and brake service this week. the price was half the cost of other garages where i knew the owners, and they found solutions that for a problem no one else would have found, or cared about. i am just like all the other reviewers here, happy and satisfied with the service, communication, and pricing i received from the staff at choice auto repair. i highly recommend you take any vehicle problems or regular service needs to them. they have the experience, the products, and the right attitude to help you stay on the road, for the best price possible, just like they did with me. they believe in themselves, and in your experience with them. if there was a 10 star rating, i would give it."
52,positive,"i love my car. perhaps to an unhealthy level. i just have to put that out on the table immediately in attempt to add some weight to the following statements.

since i found goodspeed, when i am working on my car, i look to goodspeed first. i go here for my oil and filters (they've got motul oil. simply the best!) i went here when i had trouble with my air intake and they helped me sort it out. when i started getting a check engine light related to my turbo, i went in here with my suspicions of the cause. i talked to jon for a couple minutes to describe the problem, he reached under the counter, pulled out a part and said ""this is what you need right here."" and guess what? he was right!

i will continue referring my friends here, and going here for all my needs, most especially when i start doing more serious tuning of my car. i may live 30 miles away, but it's absolutely worth the trek."
53,positive,"this five star review goes to the service department. i took my car in earlier to run a diagnostic on a possible transmission issue. sure enough, my car needs a new transmission, and it is totally covered by nissan because it is under warranty. 

when i first dropped off my car in the morning, the service team set me up with a free shuttle service to work. they even went out of their way to ask a live team member to give me a ride so i wasn't late because the shuttle driver was going on the opposite end of town. during work, they called and let me know the issue, said that the car won't be fixed until monday and they will set me up with a rental, all on nissans dime. when i go to get the rental after work, it was ready for me within 10 minutes. 

wonderful customer service from all members i encountered!"
54,positive,"this is the only place to go for exhaust work.  three years ago i had a discount muffler shop put in a full replacement exhaust system on a honda that had lasted 16 years, their new one was completely rusted out with holes the size of golf balls everywhere in just three years.  turns out all these muffler places including the chain stores use crappy thin aluminized  pipe that won't survive the corrosive winters much longer than 3 years. they will all tell you the same story and that this situation is your only choice outside of outrageously priced exhaust parts from the dealer which are made of much higher quality materials.  good for them but a complete waste of money vs the value you receive.  steve's is the only place i found after lots of research where you can get a stainless exhaust fabricated and installed that is as durable as the factory system and is much lower cost than the highly overpriced factory dealer parts  they are super folks to deal with, they give you the straight info and regular communication on your repairs, they get the job done quickly, it is right the first time and pricing is very fair.  you can't ask for more."
55,positive,"i'm not a big fan of the ""big service"" shops.  i like to find my neighborhood mechanic, or that ""small shop"" that gives you an honest evaluation and fair prices.  however, i had an alignment coupon for car x, so i brought my vehicle in there for the deal.  part of the deal is a free 30-point inspection, which i welcomed being that we're going on a big road trip in 2 days.

the visit stopped at the inspection.  the guy at the counter (k.c.) brought me back to the van to meet the mechanic (marshall) and show me a few things.  first, the tie rod end was loose and needed replacing.  and i thought, ""uuuuugh, here it comes...""  but they were kind enough to show me how it was loose, and tell me that's an easy job that i could do myself (having talked earlier about doing my own struts, brakes, etc.).  so wow - thanks for that!  they also pointed out the serpentine belt, which i kinda knew was overdue.  

while k.c. typed up an estimate, marshall sat down with me to talk about the vehicle (which he knows a ton about).  he gave me some good advice on the key things to do to make it last a long, long time.  free advice - how awesome!  additionally, he gold-starred my decisions on struts and shocks - a choice that i had fretted about, but now feel vindicated.  

so tonight i get to replace my tie rod end and bring it back to them for alignment.  and, for their hospitality, i'll throw in an overdue transmission flush job.  great job, guys!"
56,positive,"i am a senior lady and i was referred to chuck's by my to have maintenance check on my car.  i have always changed my oil, set my spark plugs for tune up on 75 chevy malibu...lets just say i love to work on cars.  well i'm older and the newer cars are more complicated.  i'm from oh where i had a great mechanic.  i was highly recommended to chucks and i must say i received a blessing that day.  i only needed a tune up...the price was more than fair for my 2010 chevy malibu.( yes i love my chevys) the staff paul and harold were exceptionally professional and kind.  the shop was very neat for a auto repair business.  i will continue to take my car to this center and will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone that needs there car repaired.  in these times it is hard to find a fair, honest business who cares about individuals, well again i thank god for chuck's auto service center and i pray there business continue to grow and grow.  bless you, and your families.  your parents should be proud they have raised some honest, caring, hard working individuals.  thank you again for your great service!!!"
57,positive,eddies service was awesome! he replaced my transmission fluids in no time. he did it at a great price with great service.
58,positive,"i've brought a few cars here and i am always impressed with their reliability and honesty 
today they're doing a big job that had i let it go would have been a new transmission 
i'm very happy they're always able to fit me in and always get it done the same day!
