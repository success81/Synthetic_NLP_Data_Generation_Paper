positive,"Grant his crew have been amazing. Had a few different repairs done there and very happy. Got a used car that knew needed work. Took it to BMW and they quoted me $2700 for the cooling system. Munich did a full repair on that, plus a valve cover gasket plus fixed another leak and found that my check engine light was bc a bad air/fuel mixture and the total repair was less than one at BMW. Then had my shift mechanism go out after I picked it up from those repairs and was like ""this is weird"". Talked to Grant and he said there wasn't a direct connection to their work as they were in a different part of the car but was willing to fix it at cost using a used part with a warrantee and it runs great. 

Had them do a little more like a battery and stuff and they will defiantly be my shop of choice. Having a German car isn't cheap but finding someone in the battle with you is key!"
positive,Okay guys what the hell... did you open up the transmission and fix it or did you put the timming belt back on like just right? It's seriously never ran this great before it used to not shift gears very well at all now it drives like a dream and all you supposedly fixed was the radiator?  I don't believe it my friend. Will be back for some more of that magic touch!
positive,"Mike and the rest of the guys down at 5 Star Auto Repair are absolute lifesavers! If I could give them more stars, I would! After my check engine light came on in my Lexus IS300, I was praying it was just a bad O2 sensor but quickly learned that the catalytic converter needed to be replaced. After a dealer quote of $4000 (which is more than I paid for the car), I went down to 5 Star Auto to get a quick estimate. 

Not only was I impressed with the price Mike was able to work out for me, I was thrilled to be able to schedule an appointment for the following monday (3 days after I came in...including weekend days). True to his word, Mike had my IS done on time and even went the extra mile to clean my lifetime air filter. The car runs like a dream, and I couldn't be happier! Wish I could keep these guys a secret but that would truly be a disservice to the community. Thanks, again, Mike and the rest of the team at 5 Star Auto! You guys rock!"
positive,"Did a muffler delete here with my GTI. I highly recommend this shop, Russ works pretty hard and knows what he's doing. Extremely reasonable price as well as it's much cheaper than anything else around town. Easy 5 stars"
positive,"I was referred here by another mechanic that did not do transmission work. They where able to replace my clutch in a reasonable amount of time, even though they where extremely busy at the time. The staff and owner is very friendly, open and upfront as far as cost and repair times. 
They worked with me even when we ran into an unexpected issue during the repair. I will use them again for any car repairs that I may have in the future. Please be advised that this is a really busy shop, so call ahead and make an appointment."
positive,"I have a 2013 Ford Fusion and unfortunately my transmission broke down.  Carlos Luna-Aispuro was my Service Advisor and he made a very ugly situation quite bearable and in the end it turned out to be great.  When I purchased my car I bought the extended warranty and as Carlos assured me it was the ""Mercedes"" of warranties. When my car broke down I was leaving for our summer trip to Boston and of course I was panicked about what this might cost me.  Carlos assured me that everything will work out and I should just go and enjoy my vacation.  I did and upon my return my car was still waiting to be approved for the warranty and Carlos gave me a free loaner which was a 2017 Ford Explorer.  When my car work was completed I ended up with a new transmission and an additional 12 months or 12,000 mile warranty on all my parts.  To be honest when I first turned in my car I thought to myself ""this car is a lemon and I am going to get rid of this and go across the street and trade it in.""  However, my whole attitude changed when I realized how Ford stood by their cars and I walked out of the dealership with my car and a new transmission AND zero money out of pocket.  I will be keeping my car thanks to the AWESOME customer service from Carlos and staying with Ford because they stand behind their automobiles."
positive,"If anyone had told me that I could find an auto repair shop in Las Vegas that would fix my out-of-town vehicle quickly and fairly, I would have laughed.  After having my car repaired at Tony's, I can say I have found an honest, efficient, and reasonable-priced car repair facility in Las Vegas (Sorry Charlie, previous reviewer,  but I can't believe you went to the same facility as me)  After having Dennis at A-1 tow my car to Tony's (Dennis and his new hire were very nice), Tony called to say that he would check everything out and get back with me.  About 3 hours later, Tony said that the car was almost finished and that all the pumps were in good condition, and only the belts and pulley needed to be replaced.  He took the car for an extended drive to check everything out before I tried to make it back home to SoCal.   I am very impressed with the quality of service at Tony's, the reasonable charge for the prompt repair, and have already told all of my friends in Vegas.   Thanks again Tony!!"
positive,"My check engine light was on, so I called and then stopped by. Bobby diagnosed the problem in a couple minutes, told me what parts I needed, and installed them for free when I went back. What amazing service!

Since my car has over 130k miles, a few things have been going wrong lately. Next time I have an issue, I will take my car back to 5 Star Auto Repair -- the name is fitting!"
positive,"You'll likely be dealing with Dale who will be a refreshing change from most shops. He does amazing work and will not charge you a dime more than required to fix your vehicle and keep his shop open. I was quoted over $300 for a thermostat replacement at Ted Weins took it to specialized auto care and Dale did it for $120.50. Since the part was actually 120 on rock auto I can only come to the conclusion he charged me 50 cents in labor.... Maybe he had an extra or got a deal on them in bulk but either way I couldn't even have done it myself for cheaper considering shipping costs! I can honestly say I have no need to shop around anymore this is my mechanic. Also if he can't do it he will refer you to another trustworthy place that can, in my case it was advanced mufflers right up the street which also received a 5 star review from me. Last thing, never go to a Ted Wiens/Firestone."
positive,I was in a jam and on panic mode after my Expedition failed a smog test due to check engine light being on. I went to 3 mechanic shops and didn't feel like I could trust the prices they were throwing out to me. I called Purrfect Auto Repair and spoke with Mike. He said bring the vehicle to him and they will try and squeeze me in to their busy schedule. The diagnostic was fairly cheap compared to other quotes I got prior to them and the diagnostic fee goes towards the repairs if you accept the work to be done. They managed to fix the issues and let me pick up my vehicle at the end of the day! I'm very satisfied with the service I received! Thank you to all of you at Purrfect Auto Repair! Good looking out Mike!
positive,I got a new muffler put on my new 2015 4x4 Dodge Ram 1500. I was referred here by 4 wheel part and was extremely happy with my results. They had the muffler put on in 45 minutes with no appointment for an extremely fair price. I am very happy. My truck roars!
positive,Great shop fast and inexpensive muffler sounds great I had a missfire in my engien that cause my cat to go bad they found out and had it fixed with the mechanic shop next door
positive,"Brian and his Body Works team is a first class business.  I would not think of going to another body shop.  They are very trustworthy and really care about their customers. The customer service is second to none!  Having your car repaired after an unexpected accident is not a pleasant thing to do.  Brian is very helpful in reviewing your options, and keeping you posted on the progress of your repairs.  They even have an online feature that keeps you posted on the repair progress along with costs and pictures of your automobile.
I have told all my friends at work about The Body Works Plus shop and their superior service.  This is also a very clean and safe shop.

You will not go wrong taking your car to this shop."
positive,"Got an oil change using Groupon and was waiting to told of all the things that where wrong with car. That didn't happen, they let me know the state of my brakes and tires and that the check engine light was on. They let me know they could check this if I wanted. I like the fact that they gave me options and did throw out a list  of every possible issue. Game room is pretty cool."
positive,I took my van in because the check engine light came on.  They ran the diagnostic test and looked at my transmission. They saw it needed replacement. They called the dealership to see if it was covered. It was and they brought my van over to the dealership.  It was my first visit. Their helpfulness and honesty will bring me back again for basic maintenance.
positive,With C&R tire I have had nothing but pleasant experiences. The other day I thought my truck needed something new in the front end and I was going to shell out a thousand bucks but they took care of me like they always have and tightened my skid plate and replaced my gas cap no more no and no more check engine light my father always took his vehicles there and so will I!
positive,I brought in my Dodge Stratus because I had severe transmission issues. Hamid gave me a quote that sounded very reasonable for the work performed. Picked up my car this morning and I'm very happy with the result. A bit of a new car feeling again. He pointed out some other things that need attention but without being pushy. I'll come back!
positive,"This place rocks! We were on a family road trip through Wisconsin when our van broke down not far from Madison. I called over a dozen auto repair shops, none of whom would take us in on such short notice with possible transmission issues. Then I called Wilde East Towne Honda and spoke with Nick Moderson-Kox in the service department. He found time to inspect our van that same morning and soon discovered the issue wasn't very serious and they could fix it while we waited. They made the necessary repairs, checking in with us often, as we hung out in the waiting area with our three children and our dog. We had been toying with the idea of purchasing a different vehicle so we ended up taking a test drive and looking at some options with Chris Alexander in the sales department as well. 

Although we didn't purchase a new vehicle that day (we needed to get back on the road), we hope to in the near future. Wilde Honda is located five hours from our house, but we are still talking about going back there when we decide to buy our next vehicle because of the great staff there. I would highly recommend this place."
positive,"I took my vehicle to Oasis for a transmission flush and a coolant flush today, I was very impressed with the managers (justin) honesty and professionalism. The price was very fair and the work was done in a very timely manner. 
I brought my vehicle in based on the recommendation of some family members, and after this first impression I plan on being a long term customer. Every positive review about Oasis seems completely accurate based on my experience.
Finally, an honest mechanic shop!"
positive,"Wow...
So, the other day (and this would have to happen after a difficult day, making it MORE difficult,) I was on my way home when my car started sounding like a rocket ship. 
My old Toyota (edging up on 200,000 miles, yep, I drive em hard,) had a blow out in the connecting pipe between the muffler and converter. Previously, I'd had folks tell me I needed a whole new muffler system, and I'm not rich, so the 1200 to 1500 they were quoting me was just too much. 
I was sort of desperate, and asked around. After talking to my Brother-In-law and doing some research online, I found All Star Discount Muffler...

And was amazed...

All Star is located just off of W.130th in an unassuming neighborhood. Now, when I headed out there I was told; GET THERE EARLY. They only do things by first come, first serve. No reservations. Why?

They're that FREAKING BUSY!! (and that freaking GOOD.)
They opened the gates at 8:30 AM, and as I and two more vehicles drove in...so did a dozen more. People from all over bring their cars in JUST BY WORD OF MOUTH, and the mix of people, from housewives to businessmen to even other mechanics shows how trusted these folks are. 

 The place is no-frills; there's some benches in the main office area, and you can wait or come back, but I'll tell you, you don't have to wait long. 

The staff like Dave and Amy are thoughtful, efficient and what I like about it is that Dave took me under my vehicle and showed me what they were going to do and then quoted me a price. 

I didn't need a whole system; I needed a pipe between the converter and the muffler, which was still quite good and didn't need replacing. That was it. 

With parts and labor folks; 40$ and in and out in about 40 minutes. 

Again, this is no frills, but they will NOT GYP YOU!  I saw testimonials here, on other review sites, and there were a dozen or more on a peg board in the office written on business cards, stationary and formal letterhead. People are thankful for great service and a good deal. 

(Heck, while I was there, two guys from OTHER AUTO PLACES brought cars in to be repaired because they couldn't. :) Also, all of their work carries guarantees as long as you keep your receipts, and I've heard they honor the work they do.  

So, if you want to be treated well, and get All Star prices, try All Star Discount Muffler for your brake, shock, and exhaust needs; you're wallet and your car will thank you:)"
positive,"The best of the best.. my transmission was making a humming noise so I took my car to them to have it checked. To make the story short, they called the Nissan Dealership and I received a new transmission at no cost despite being a salvage car! I only paid $60 to this shop! They are very honest mechanics."
positive,Terry just saved me over $4500! I had a different shop tell me my transmission was shot. I got a 2nd opinion from Terry's and thankfully he was honest and didn't find anything wrong! Will only go to Terry's from now on.
positive,"I came in yesterday as my check engine light came on while I was driving to Las Vegas from LA.  I also was due for an oil change.  They changed my oil, diagnosed my check engine light and confirmed I was safe to drive back to LA on the check engine light all within an hour while providing me a comfortable place to sit and a complementary soda.  I was so impressed I wanted to have them complete the repairs for my check engine light but I ended up needing to  rush back to LA.  If I ever find my self stranded in Vegas again I know who I will call.  Now I have to find a shop near me that I hope is even half as reliable as Busy Buggy."
positive,"These guys are the best !!! Honest, dependable, reliable mechanics. They help me out!  They could have made $500 for an transmission. But they said it was fine and didn't charge me. Sun Auto Service."
positive,"I'm surprise to read the other reviews on this location. I was in desperate need of an oil change. I put it off way too long. I pulled in on Sunday morning at 8:55am and they were ready and willing to take me right away. They open at 9am. I was quoted a price right away. $49. I don't mind because they check air filters, tires, transmission and such. I needed to clean my oil but I waited too long to get it changed and for $13 dollars it's worth it. I definitely needed at air filter was well. My old one was black! Also they knew my left driver's side blinker was out and offered to change it for me. Luckily I had the bulb in my car and they switched it out for me for $5 bucks. I've never had better service and was out of there in 20 minutes!"
positive,"This place is still as good as it gets. I have gotten many oil changes here, and they are always able to fit me in a pinch. Today I had taken my car to troubleshoot the tire pressure sensor system, and it is a hard thing to troubleshoot.  They had checked the sensors and could not find why it was happening and recommended me to Ford. They didn't charge me for their troubleshooting, which was highly appreciated. 

If you need your car repaired or anything done, I would recommend this place hands down.

Every time I have been here the prices have been more than fair and the service has been some of the best that I have ever had. I personally cannot do oil changes and troubleshoot my car in my apartment complex (as it is against their policies), so this is definitely the next best option."
positive,"Second time to Rebel Automotive, had oil change and transmission fluid change.  Super fast.  Took my daughter and we played in the arcade, she had a blast."
positive,"Sept 17, 2016
At 4 a.m. We were leaving Las Vegas and as we were 35 minutes out our transmission blew. We called AAA and waited for 30 minutes. During our wait we called several auto places which we're closed due to the day being Sunday. Then we saw this company Busy Buggy!!!! They are open 23/7,  I have to say my heart was lifted when this gentlemen said YES! We can get the part and have the truck (1997 Chevy Tahoe) ready by Monday no later then 6 p.m. Whew what a relief to hear that. We had free shuttle from Busy Buggy to the hotel, they have complimentary Coffee, drinks, ice cream, and snacks. It made us feel like they understood what we just went through and having something to eat for free was just a way to say it will be okay. In conclusion we are on the road, the truck is running excellent, and we feel safe for the long drive home. 
As for the professional mechanics, we learned that each mechanic are well experienced and they love what they do, FIX CARS! I give this company a 5 STAR rating in the categories: Customer Service (honesty), Post performance (transmission installation), and complementary amenities (drinks, and snacks). 
Thank you Busy Buggy and the crew that worked on our 1997 Chevy Tahoe LT

The Marmon's (Tracy Ca)"
positive,"I'm so glad I found an honest and inexpensive place I can take my car to I took my car in for an oil change and a transmission drain +refill, and they finished the job within a couple of minutes. There was absolutely no waiting time because the mechanic was so quick and efficient. Not just that, they rotated my tires and checked my tire pressure for free. My car runs better than it's ever run before now. This place is the only place I will bring my car from now on. 
The tricky thing about this place is that it is located behind a few restaurants, so it's a little hard to find."
positive,Needed a piece of tube bent for a project.  turned out that the tube I had wouldn't bend right with their bender. They had the same size pipe but different type in stock that would work for my project (non exhaust related) they bent it to my specs in just a few mins and didn't cost much at all.  Ended up fitting perfect.  thank you pro muffler will be back for a flowmaster in the future.
positive,"These guys straight up rock! It's very nice to find a local shop that gives you fast honest estimates that are very detailed. They solve the problem and get the job done very quickly. Personal calls from the mechanics to let you know how the job is coming along. Everything just seems to go better at Crawfords! Job done right, fast, and all at the best prices around! I don't go anywhere else. Oil change, tune-up, brakes, muffler, tires, or any engine repair...they do it all. Check them out next time you need ANY auto service or repair."
positive,Was a little unsure as to what was needed with my car. I thought perhaps I needed a whole new muffler altogether which I was a bit apprehensive given I was almost broke but couldn't make it to my job with my vehicle dragging a broken muffler around. When I got there I was told he would try and look at it today as he was short a guy. I called during lunch to see if they'd gotten a look at the car and what it'd need and voila they had it all set to be picked up and they welded the two parts of my dual exhaust back together costing me a total of $40. I had to have him repeat the amount like 3 times because it just sounded too good to be true. I will be a returning customer for as long as I live here. I appreciate your help guys! Couldn't be happier!
positive,"So, I'm usually never really blown away by most places customer service, but Chris and his team at the Valvoline on Elkhorn and Grand Montecito nailed it. I had been having some issues with my transmission and wanted to see what was going on with the car. Chris greeted me with a smile and listened carefully as I explained what was going on. He not only offered to look at the transmission, but did checks on all fluid levels, belts, filters, brakes and tires. He took the time to explain in detail what he was checking for and what required immediate service and what didn't. I was so impressed by his ethic that I decided to get the work done. Not only did he get the work done in a timely manner, he also got me a discount on some of the work. I will be bringing my car back here frequently and highly recommend this location to anyone who values a great customer service experience!"
positive,"I brought in our Range Rover in for service because the check engine light was on.  Service agent Ana was very helpful and set me up with a loaner car for the day because I had to get to work.  Ana called me within 3 hours and my car issue was resolved!  Thank you Ana for making it a smooth service with my repair!  Hope to not be back anytime soon, but if I do, I'll be back to see Ana!"
positive,"My usually reliable vehicle decided out start acting up the day my hubs & I decided to roll out to Las Vegas for our One Year Anniversary. For some reason, it sounded like it wouldn't shift the gear (I have an automatic & I don't know much about vehicles) and wouldn't ""climb"" hills. When we pulled into Treasure Island's parking garage & the uphill driveway, my car started shaking and lights started flashing. Dude. Really. 

We waited until the next day (Today, Monday) & took it in. Edward helped us out as soon as he got off the phone & let me know he can diagnose it. Then, Gustavo pulled up & drove us back to TI - with my car so he can see what we're talking about. Nice.

About two/three hours later - Ed calls me to let me know there are damaged wires that connect to the computer that talks to my transmission & it's basically telling it it's no good. (I had just received and oil change and tire rotation Friday. Wish it was caught then) 

$260 to repair. Truthfully not THAT bad, so I called back & said go for it. 

TIMELINE: 

9:30(ish) - Took it over 

11:30 - Edward called to tell me what was wrong 

12:55 - Edward called to tell me it was done. AWESOME!!! 

1:03 - Gustavo's at our hotel. AGAIN, AWESOME! 

We didn't even have to ask to be picked up and expected to have to take a Taxi or walk. They didn't even charge for that. 

The owner - I'm assuming from reading reviews, came out to ring us out & let me know what else it needed. I was grateful.

Yelp, you did exactly what you were created to do. Busy Buggy - so did you."
positive,"I DO NOT like taking my vehicles to a shop.  But when its 6000 degrees outside, i can't stand being in the garage. Joe at Sun Auto talked to me respectfully, and gave me a diagnosis/quote of my problem early the next day. I am pretty comfortable working on vehicles old and new, and i thought i had already pinpointed the problem as a transmission issue.  If they had told me so, they could have ripped me off easily by telling me i needed a rebuild. "" Luckily"" it was brake noise, and required a front brake job.  It was not cheap, but sometimes peace of mind that a job is done right, is worth paying for.  You can probably find cheaper prices, but i will certainly give them business again if i needed help."
positive,"I haven't even had my car repaired yet, and already I want to give the Hargraves team five stars, but I'm giving them four just to be reasonable. I will update when I've completed business with them. This is the first time I've written a review before my my transaction was complete with a business, but because my treatment has been so good I'm doing a review now. I was involved in an accident (other person's fault) that totaled my car. I had it dropped off at Hargraves at the recommendation of my mechanic and every interaction has been professional and kind. The team at Hargraves (with special kudos to David and Scott) have consistently gone above and beyond to keep me informed and updated about the status of my vehicle. This has been important because the slimeball who hit me was a used car salesman from Europa Auto Sales and when the police officer took his information, he lied about who owned the car and who's insurance was responsible (it's Europa's responsibility, but they've been scumbags and won't release their information, so I'll have to get a lawyer *sigh*) Fortunately the team at Hargraves is a rare example of a business who sincerely works for their customer's best interest."
positive,"My old 320ml decided to cause me problems - it was stuck in low range and wouldn't shift out.  I took it to Sun Devil Auto who have done most of the recent maintenance on the suv (very competently I might add) and advertise that they do transmission work.  To their credit, they were unfamiliar about working on an old Mercedes and recommended going to a Mercedes speciality shop.

I've gone through a few Mercedes shops and have had little issues with each, so I decided to try European Auto Salon on 7th St.  Glad I did.

They were able to get me in the next morning.  They tried to find a simple solution, but of course few Mercedes' issues are ever simple.  But after dropping me off at work, they called an hour later with the diagnosis and estimate that proved to be right on.

After lunch, the car was ready and I drove away - a little poorer, but happy to have found a new shop I trust."
positive,"Great service. Great prices.  They were able to fix my car within the day. And even offered me a ride back to work. They are very knowledgeable about the German cars. And their prices for their service is on par with other people who do not specialize in German cars. 

So I really feel you're getting a great deal from these guys. If you want your car repaired with authentic OEM parts. Then these are your guys."
positive,"Thanks to Lamborghini of Las Vegas (this is a not accurate when they are based in Henderson!) I sold my 2010 Lamborghini 560-4 Spyder to a Lambo dealer in CA and I will never own another Lambo.  Terrible and arrogant sales manager basically laughed at me when I called him about a trade difference on a new Aventador LP-700 saying there was no market for my car and he did not have any Aventadors unless I paid him $80,000 over the already absurd list price of $400,000 range.  I own a new Ferrari California I bought from the Penske-Wynn Las Vegas dealer and Tony  the sales person and Rich the service manager are beyond awesome, opposite of these jerks.  Also the Ferrari is far superior compared to the Lambo with better dual clutch transmission, far nicer interior, vastly superior technology in the GPS, monitoring LCDS and far superior sound system plus a hard top conv for about the same price as my prior Lambo.  I will never sell or trade my Ferrari California but when I decide to buy another amazing sports car it will be a new Ferrari when they come out with a new model to blow away the Aventador!

positive,"This is the second time I have brought my car to them.  First time my check engine light was on.  They came out to check it tighten my gas cap and reset the light.  Then set me on my way no charge!  
This time my temperature gauge said it was overheating.  Drove to their shop and they even drove me down the street back to work!  I was scared it was the radiator and was going to be serious.  Got a call that it was just the gauge that was broken and everything else was fine.  They fixed it for a very reasonable price!  It is awesome to find honest mechanics.  Most shops will take advantage of people.  Will for sure be back!"
positive,"My tc light was on and with that comes the check engine light.  That Thursday on the way home my engine oil pressure light came on but then went right off.  Taking a flight that night, had to wait til I came back.  In the meantime, E's car didn't start on Monday so in his went also.  They had to keep his overnight (waiting on stupid warranty ppl).  So Tuesday I drive my car to BB and drop it off.  Marco is always so pleasant but no matter how sweet he is I'm always scared to my whits end about the cost.  They take E and I to work.  Long story short, car had no oil...wtf (I know I know, you think Im a girl and don't know any better but that's not true lol  I have a sensor that tells me when to get my oil change but apparently that isn't working).  How is that even possible and why didn't my engine oil pressure light stay on?  Anyways, not BB's problem.  Gave me an oil change (I was at 4% but clearly that tracking device isn't working lol)  Marco called and said everything is fine.  I was 99.99999% certain the TC light would come back on.  I told Marco to just go ahead and change whatever.  He said Lynette, let's just wait and see.  I was kinda adamant about just changing the sensor and he said Lynette I mean I can if you insist but let's really just wait and see.  
Welp, it's been almost 2 weeks and it's stayed off (knock on wood).  IDK if Marco was scared of my tears again lol and said just fix it so she doesn't come back lol or if the sensor was on due to the nail that was in my damn tire.  Anywho...what I thought was going to potentially be a $500+ job, turned out to be under $60 :)  And Ed's car was also back up and running and we both left w our cars on Tuesday.  I can't express enough how honest these guys are and how they do everything  possible to not make the damage so bad!
As always, with sincere thanks and gratitude, LC"
positive,"I was incredibly nervous about taking my car to a major chain as I've heard and read many mixed reviews about numerous locations. My experience at this Aamco was fantastic though!

Larry was incredibly kind and helpful in explaining what was wrong with my transmission, and when it came time to fix it, he ended up charging me the originally estimated cost even though he needed to do a little extra work. 

Can't recommend this place enough!"
positive,"Got a great deal on my new tires.  I just happened to be getting some work done over at the muffler shop in the same area.  I needed new tires too and just walked in, no appointment or call.  We went over the options i chose to put on 4 new BF Goodrich Adv. TA sports, great price and service, friendly, nice waiting area too.  Was done all in the same day as they had the tires at nearby warehouse they just had to simply get them.  Did an alignment and car is smooth and tires feel good.  Thanks again!"
positive,"I live in Los Angeles and drove out to Henderson to visit my brother who lives here. My check engine light came on, I brought my car here just by chance to get it checked out. These guys are awesome, honest and know what they are doing, I highly recommend them!"
positive,"I buy a transmission over 1,300 dlls for my mustang they shipped a wrong item after wait  7 day in the middle of the new year holidays but also i consider weather road conditions at this time of the season a lot of snow in many states the thing is mistakes happen  is not a perfect business doesn't matter what kind of business but what is matter is customer service attitude they realize  is a mistake that it has to be fix it maybe not them but it maybe a vendor mistake just because they sold the product is them the one who has to fix the issue. after they make some calls they order other transmission for another vendor they apologize and explain to me that if it was for them they will have the transmission ready in the same day but as a customer we have to understand that are limitations for every situation 
managers are employees as well and they have limitations but what really matter is the effort they put into a customer complain Paul the store manager care about his customers same as his employees i could just get my money back and go buy it some where else but it will take days also to be deliver, it maybe send the wrong or broken item as well and even worst who knows it maybe be a good or bed customer service so i just decided to let them order the other from a different vendor

i like this auto zone store"
positive,"Thanks to Yelp, I found this awesome car repair shop.  I have nothing but the absolute BEST things to say about them.  The most professional, honest and effecient that I have ever worked with.  Unfortunately, I just bought a ""lemon"" and 25th St. Automotive took some of the pain out this process.  They are just amazing....I knew that the transmission was most likely shot.  They spent the minimum amout of time and money to confirm this and were more than accomodating.  I would bring another car back here in a heartbeat. 

Overall, a it's very dismal circumstance regarding my newly purchased used car, but an absolutely fabulous experience with 25th Street Automotive."
positive,"If you visit Aamco at the Van Buren St. location, ask for Corey. Very knowledgeable and personable. If you have transmission problems this is the guy to go see!"
positive,"A while back I took my 4Runner in for a transmission estimate because the dealership said that ALL test came back and that I needed a $3640 rebuilt transmission put in. i took it to Oasis since I started doing oil changes there. They said they didn't believe the transmission was the issue but the timing belt itself. They ask if they could pull the covers and inspect inside and YES it was that. I was so PLEASED to get out for about $550 and my truck runs great. They have all of my future repairs and referrals. Thanks guys!

positive,These guys are great. I was able to get my jeep Cherokee in and out within a couple of hours. Price was reasonable for a cat back exhaust with a magnaflow muffler installed. My only gripe is they didn't have anymore stickers... My jeep could always use more stickers to hold it together and keep it from falling apart.
positive,"At first I was skeptic if I should take my car there. Being I've been scammed when I bought the car from a private seller in the first place. But what the heck! 

The office was extremely clean (and it smelled nice too!) something you might not expect from a repair shop. Refreshment bar was well stocked & I mean REALLY well stocked. Hmmm, not your typical repair shop AGAIN. and they have a CLEAN bathroom! Imagine that! AGAIN, not typical for a car repair shop. With that said, let's get down to the real deal..

Mr. Hamid (I'm guessing he's the licensed lead mechanic) was very welcoming. Received us timely & was very attentive to our concerns about the car. I was telling him the details & I guess he figured out that i was upset about the car being a junk, he told me they'll check the car out & tell me what's wrong. Offered me some refreshments & magazines while I wait. He came back saying something's off with the transmission. What?! TRANSMISSION?! I almost fainted! Man! One thing over the other, quoted me the amount me the amount I expected -- but still I was like, lemme look around..

Got a second opinion & boy!! They quoted me 4x as much for the same problem BUSY BUGGY diagnosed my car for! Long story short, took my car back to them & after 2days, whoollaaa!!! My car started running like brand new!! Plus, it included 1 year warranty!!! Damn!! One whole year!! I'm a fan!! Spreading the word over the valley. This is the to go place if you want QUALITY & HONEST service."
positive,"I took a company van, a 2005 Chevrolet Express with 300,000 miles in for transmission and brake service this week. The price was half the cost of other garages where I knew the owners, and they found solutions that for a problem no one else would have found, or cared about. I am just like all the other reviewers here, happy and satisfied with the service, communication, and pricing I received from the staff at Choice Auto Repair. I highly recommend you take any vehicle problems or regular service needs to them. They have the experience, the products, and the right attitude to help you stay on the road, for the best price possible, just like they did with me. They believe in themselves, and in your experience with them. If there was a 10 star rating, I would give it."
positive,"I love my car. Perhaps to an unhealthy level. I just have to put that out on the table immediately in attempt to add some weight to the following statements.

Since I found Goodspeed, when I am working on my car, I look to Goodspeed first. I go here for my oil and filters (They've got Motul oil. Simply the best!) I went here when I had trouble with my air intake and they helped me sort it out. When I started getting a check engine light related to my turbo, I went in here with my suspicions of the cause. I talked to Jon for a couple minutes to describe the problem, he reached under the counter, pulled out a part and said ""This is what you need right here."" And guess what? He was right!

I will continue referring my friends here, and going here for all my needs, most especially when I start doing more serious tuning of my car. I may live 30 miles away, but it's absolutely worth the trek."
positive,"This five star review goes to the service department. I took my car in earlier to run a diagnostic on a possible transmission issue. Sure enough, my car needs a new transmission, and it is totally covered by Nissan because it is under warranty. 

When I first dropped off my car in the morning, the service team set me up with a free shuttle service to work. They even went out of their way to ask a live team member to give me a ride so I wasn't late because the shuttle driver was going on the opposite end of town. During work, they called and let me know the issue, said that the car won't be fixed until Monday and they will set me up with a rental, all on Nissans dime. When I go to get the rental after work, it was ready for me within 10 minutes. 

Wonderful customer service from all members I encountered!"
positive,"This is the only place to go for exhaust work.  Three years ago I had a discount muffler shop put in a full replacement exhaust system on a Honda that had lasted 16 years, their new one was completely rusted out with holes the size of golf balls everywhere in just three years.  Turns out all these muffler places including the chain stores use crappy thin aluminized  pipe that won't survive the corrosive winters much longer than 3 years. They will all tell you the same story and that this situation is your only choice outside of outrageously priced exhaust parts from the dealer which are made of much higher quality materials.  Good for them but a complete waste of money vs the value you receive.  Steve's is the only place I found after lots of research where you can get a stainless exhaust fabricated and installed that is as durable as the factory system and is much lower cost than the highly overpriced factory dealer parts  They are super folks to deal with, they give you the straight info and regular communication on your repairs, they get the job done quickly, it is right the first time and pricing is very fair.  You can't ask for more."
positive,"I'm not a big fan of the ""big service"" shops.  I like to find my neighborhood mechanic, or that ""small shop"" that gives you an honest evaluation and fair prices.  However, I had an alignment coupon for Car X, so I brought my vehicle in there for the deal.  Part of the deal is a free 30-point inspection, which I welcomed being that we're going on a big road trip in 2 days.

The visit stopped at the inspection.  The guy at the counter (K.C.) brought me back to the van to meet the mechanic (Marshall) and show me a few things.  First, the tie rod end was loose and needed replacing.  And I thought, ""uuuuugh, here it comes...""  But they were kind enough to SHOW me how it was loose, and tell me that's an easy job that I could do myself (having talked earlier about doing my own struts, brakes, etc.).  So wow - thanks for that!  They also pointed out the serpentine belt, which I kinda knew was overdue.  

While K.C. typed up an estimate, Marshall sat down with me to talk about the vehicle (which he knows a TON about).  He gave me some good advice on the key things to do to make it last a long, long time.  Free advice - how awesome!  Additionally, he gold-starred my decisions on struts and shocks - a choice that I had fretted about, but now feel vindicated.  

So tonight I get to replace my tie rod end and bring it back to them for alignment.  And, for their hospitality, I'll throw in an overdue transmission flush job.  Great job, guys!"
positive,"I am a senior lady and I was referred to Chuck's by my to have maintenance check on my car.  I have always changed my oil, set my spark plugs for tune up on 75 chevy malibu...lets just say I love to work on cars.  Well I'm older and the newer cars are more complicated.  I'm from OH where I had a great mechanic.  I was highly recommended to Chucks and I must say I received a blessing that day.  I only needed a tune up...the price was more than fair for my 2010 chevy malibu.( yes I love my chevys) The staff Paul and Harold were exceptionally professional and kind.  The shop was very neat for a auto repair business.  I will continue to take my car to this center and will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone that needs there car repaired.  In these times it is hard to find a fair, honest business who cares about individuals, well again I thank God for Chuck's Auto Service Center and I pray there business continue to grow and grow.  Bless you, and your families.  Your parents should be proud they have raised some honest, caring, hard working individuals.  Thank you again for your great service!!!"
positive,Eddies service was awesome! He replaced my transmission fluids in no time. He did it at a great price with great service.
positive,"I've brought a few cars here and I am always impressed with their reliability and honesty 
Today they're doing a big job that had I let it go would have been a new transmission 
I'm very happy they're always able to fit me in and always get it done the same day! 
Thanks"
positive,"Today l brought my mini van with damaged muffler. These guys are The Best... Every place I took my car they wanted to replace the entire part which cost arm and a leg. These guys do it the right way . Replacing just the section with damaged. Saved me lot of $$$.. 
The price they charged me was more than reasonable. Very friendly staff. They take appointment and take you in on time. I totally recommend these guys. If you have problems with muffler on your car stop looking around and drive down here to these guys no matter where you live in Las Vegas... I assure you it worth the drive. Thank you so much guys for doing suck a great work on my car. A+++++++"
positive,"Found this shop online searching and saw the great reviews here on Yelp. Brought in my 2010 F-150 Raptor because my Flowmasters were too obnoxiously loud at highway speeds, too much cabin drone. They are installing a Magnaflow muffler and piping right now. Super happy with the service and price. Definitely will come back for future work!!"
positive,"First, when you walk in, you'll notice the place just looks and feels so much cleaner than most auto-shops. Denelle I think is her name works the front desk, she was great, and she guessed my car's issue right just from my sound impersonation, hah! They checked it out while changing my oil, sure enough, same thing my other mechanic said. I had a coupon for a $20 oil change, but that is for regular oil and mine takes synthetic. They double checked that it can't take regular, and again, I know my usual guy uses synthetic as well, but to make it up they gave me the same $10 off the usual synthetic price, $60, which is exactly what I usually pay, so total was $50...and they checked my fluids, check engine light issue, as well as confirming the noise is the power steering pump. But what put it over the top was a MAILED thank you note, signed by them. Ok, I love my mechanic, but these guys are my new go-to for routine stuff. second opinions, and possibly big jobs if I want to make sure it's done well."
positive,"I came here to buy transmission oil and had no clue what I was doing. The sales associate actually checked my transmission level and found out I didn't even need it, and then helped me pick out new windshield wipers. He even offered to put the wipers on since I think he could tell that I was clueless. 

Will definitely come back."
positive,"I recently had my car repaired at Wolbert's.  I had some deep scratches, dents and a major crunch in the front end.  They did a fantastic 'bang up' job, and my car looks brand new!  If I could give them ten stars, I would.  I highly recommend them!!"
positive,"Took our car into a different shop to get the transmission fluid flushed because they charged a decent price. We go to pick up the car and they tell us we need all new brake pads and two new front rotors. I ask how much and the guy says $650 plus tax. I had to pick my jaw up from the ground. I was recommended to Choice Auto Repair by my dad and am so thankful I was!! Kevin was able to get us in first thing the next day. He called and informed us that only the front brake pads needed to be replaced and that he could resurface the front two rotors instead of replacing them. The grand total was $150 plus tax. This shop is awesome, I will never take any of my cars anywhere else. I really do appreciate their honesty and fair prices."
positive,"I stopped in to relax a minute, after having my car repaired.  I ordered the Carmel macchiato which I thoroughly enjoyed. I really liked the long community table, I met and chatted with some very friendly people from in and out of town.  Sure, the parking is cramped and the lot sucks, but I didn't come for that, I came for the coffee  and good service, which was spot on.  Thanks Starbucks."
positive,The best hands down for all your transmission needs! We are repeat customers and will always go here first rather than waist our time anywhere else. Super customer service!
positive,"Hands down the most honest service shop. 

I have a warranty with car max and my transmission has been funky ever since I got the darn car. It's only 3 years old (18 months I've had it) and it's never running correctly. I called carmax and of course they wanted to charge me $200 just to see it and the wait was two weeks to get an appointment. What da heck?! So I asked if I could get a rental til then and they said no, not til they say somethings wrong with it. Soooo, let me get this straight.. I'm supposed to drive a car that keeps dying on me while driving with two small kids in 110 degree weather.. wow. 

Sorry, getting to the point... 
so the warranty people recommend this place and I call. The gentleman on the phone was completely sweet, understanding and got me in the next day. I left my car there at 8am and when I picked it up he said it is skipping but not enough for the warranty to replace it and for now to be careful.. it may also just be bad gasoline. I knew that they looked at it so I had to pay the $80 inspection fee (as states on my warranty) and he was sweet and told me no they were waiving it since nothing was technically wrong. 

From start to finish I cannot explain how easy, simple, sweet and efficient they were. I will always go to them first with my business."
positive,"I was referred to Tony's by a Napa Warranty agent and quickly read their reviews. After feeling comfortable, I called them up and booked an appointment for the next day. Upon arriving, I was promptly greeted and made aware upfront that I would have a long wait time based on the repair I needed done. About 45 minutes later, Tony informed me that my repair was going to be pricey. Instead of him being money hungry, he talked with me and gave me his opinion...the repair would be more expensive than my car was worth and he didn't think it would be worth it. That could've been the end, HOWEVER, he went the extra mile to escort me to a dealership and put me in trusted hands. Thanks to Tony I was able to trade in my car and get a 2016 Chevy Cruze for an amazing price and he even went on a test drive with me to ensure I was satisfied with the purchase. Tony is the definition of a stand up guy and deserves everything good that comes his way. I didn't have the pleasure of getting my car repaired by him, but I will refer him to everyone I come across and will return if I ever need anything. He's honest, charismatic, and a great business man!"
positive,"There's a reason it helps to get an appointment for service at Bell Union Auto Service -- the word is out about how great this place is! 

Ken and the staff here are the real deal, honest, friendly,and they know what to do to fix it right. I had some check engine light issues and other warnings for service and it was time for maintenance on my Liberty. With 112,000miles, I anticipated the worst but they put everything right and included it all in the usual service rate, a fraction of the cost to visit a dealer. 

What I discovered is that they do only what is necessary -- no inflated charges -- no cashing in at my expense. I've tried the ""jiffy"" coupons and ""gruupy"" deals only to find they are simply looking to up charge for added unneeded services. Recently moved to Grayhawk and have been looking for an auto service I could really trust. So glad to have found Bell Union!"
positive,"Had to take my Altima in for a recall. Service staff was super helpful and friendly. They hooked me up with an Uber to and from the place which was super easy to use. I did have to pay $225 for transmission fluid change on my CTV tranny, which seemed like a lot, but the parts guy gave me a free touch up paint for a scratch so that was cool. Car cane back nice and clean. No complaints."
positive,Super service! T&M is probably the most honest auto shop in Vegas. They do great work whether its a transmission to changing the emission controls. I can't say enough and I can say that from experience as I worked in the auto repair business years ago while going to college.
positive,"I am pleased to update the fact that Brian, the current owner of Buddy's Auto Repair, has made things right. A couple of weeks ago I received a call and email from Brian about my experience and his desire to rectify what happened. It was just in time too, as my check engine light had been coming on an off. So, I took my truck in and was given a very thorough diagnostic exam for free. I ended up needing new plugs and sparks, along with a duct valve and Buddy's replaced all of that for $100. Additionally, they made sure that the loaner car had a full tank of gas. I am very happy and will, for sure, reach out to Buddy's in the future. I appreciate Brian's actions!"
positive,Brandon was awesome! He was able to do a code check for our check engine light. Unfortunately we have to take it to a speciality mechanic. We appreciated Brandon's superb customer service & his honesty.
positive,"Excellent service. Great and honest people... Got my engine oil, manual transmission and transaxle gear lube, transfer case lubricant, brake/clutch fluid and power steering fluid done today. Great price compared to Tireworks, Sears and the over rated Auto Pro shop. Joe who is the office, made me feel welcome. Al the mechanic did a great job. Thanks a whole lot to Tiffany Bautista-Medeiros for the help. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO GO EXCEL... Great honest people, Overall Great Company... Will return for routine maintenance for my EVO 9..."
positive,"So, I'll start this off by saying that no one ever likes to get their car repaired...especially in Arizona...and certainly when that repair is associated with the AC. Knowing full well the potential cost of the repairs, I approached my search for a repair shop with caution. 

TJ and the guys at Kinkade's were super awesome. TJ shot me a quote within the hour with two possible costs depending on how bad the ac was. Come to find out, it was the dreaded compressor that had gone out. TJ gave me options, letting me know what he recommended, but not pushing needless repairs on an already expensive situation. He was straight up and forward, and I am glad he was. My wife and two boys are now riding in a nice refrigerated chariot, facing these nasty summer temps. 

I will certainly be going back if I need anything else repaired. They made a painful situation very bearable."
positive,These guys made a terrible experience bearable during my last trip through Las Vegas. My transmission on my truck went out while towing my travel trailer through Las Vegas. Chris was extremely helpful. He tried to look for cost saving options for me and the work was done extremely fast.
positive,Richards Auto Clinic was great! I dropped my Jeep off that had been having issues for several months. Previously another mechanic had said that he couldn't figure out why my check engine light was on and that it was something I would just have to live with. My car was at Richards for only 2 days before he called with great news. He fixed all the issues that I was having in a timely manner and at a reasonable price. Even better- after asking if he had a military discount he gave me 10% off! Definitely head to this place if you are in the area.
positive,"Who in the world can actually BRAG about having an amazing mechanic? I CAN. 

Bob is the real deal. My family has taken a veritable fleet of cars to him over the past decade--Hondas, Toyotas, Mazdas, and a mid-90s POS Nissan. He has helped us with everything from the mundane (window switches, antennas) to the crucial (brakes, transmissions, A/C). His work ethic is unparalleled and he has gone above and beyond for us more times than we could count.

Tip: Don't complain if you find a lone cat sleeping in your back seat when you go to pick your car. It's part of the experience!  

They don't make 'em like this anymore, folks."
positive,"We just brought our car there to be taken care of. We were told by another auto place that we needed our brakes done and the transmission fluid done. Well we didn't and thank you the T & M Automotive for being honest. Never again will we take our vehicles to ""convenience"" places for oil changes and such. It's just not worth it. Our vehicles will only be coming here from now on!!"
positive,"I just had my car repaired with I-17 Collision. I am very thankful for the repair work done on my Mazda. You can not tell there was any damage doneThe paint matches perfectly, the staff was efficient, courteous, and very skilled.  My mechanic recommended me to this shop for the body repair and I can see why. They are experts! My thanks to Xavier, Rose, and the entire staff."
positive,"Very pleased with my service.  Had a transmission leak repaired, broken Windshield replaced, oil changed, smog certed and they had a tow truck pick it up from my home and add it to my bill so I didn't have to worry about it!  Friendly, professional, reasonable, and convenient:  A rare find in automotive repair!"
positive,"Brought my car in because check engine light was on. They were honest and upfront about the issues it could be. They explained all my options and even said they'd give me references because it was outside of the scope of work that they offer. Being a woman, it's refreshing to go to a place that isn't going to try and take advantage. They were all very knowledgeable and educated me on the issue with my car."
positive,"Hamid reached out to me and his customer service skills alone deserve the five stars. He has advised that he will be retraining staff members and seeking out for qualified technicians.  

 His comment back is incorrect regarding how many times I have visited, but that is probably due to my last name changing. 

Overall I am now satisfied with their service and I trust Hamid so that is what matters. 

---------Original review was one star and comments below


This place is appealing due to their high positive reviews and free cookies, which sold me even after they messed up on my car once before. It's hard finding a good mechanic and I figured maybe they were having a off day. 

Long story short twice they have repaired the wrong thing (tail light issues) which was fine with me since I caught it and they didn't try to charge me for the piece I didn't need. But what scares me is they also did work on my engine which is not so easily visible as a tail light. And now my check engine light is on.. Eeeekkk. 

I told the mechanic ""I don't  know how you have such great reviews."" And he replied ""well I'm actually a aircraft mechanic"" .. Um is that suppose to explain why you couldn't read my dashboard to know which tail light to replace or is that your way of saying you are above being a car mechanic?! 

The gentlemen at the front desk handled the situation very well but unfortunately they can't duplicate ten more of him. 

Sorry for the bad review but you need to hire better mechanics."
positive,"These guys are INSANE.  Again I thought I needed a ton of unnecessary things done on my car... and 25th Street Auto talked me OUT of them.  I was going to do a complete tear out and screen and gasket replacement in my transmission and Bill told me it was not needed and costly.  I think we need to call in the guys with the straight jackets!

Again a great motor and transmission oil change... and then found a tiny leak in my steering fluid that I will keep an eye on."
positive,"The staff members at Audi Chandler are some of the friendliest I've interacted with, from the salespeople to the financing department. I'd been kicking around the idea of getting an Audi as we needed to trade up from my compact hatchback to a car that can transport more than 2 people comfortably. I was interested in an A4 or an A5, and knew that Audi Chandler had a manual transmission A4 on the lot. I walked in on a Friday with about 15-20 minutes of free time before dinner and worked with Jorge to take a look at the interior and exterior of the two models. Before I left, I told Jorge that I would likely be back in on Saturday or Sunday for a test drive and he didn't pressure me at all.

I came back on Sunday and worked with Adora (turns out, Jorge wasn't working that day) and she let me test drive the manual A4 as well as an automatic A4 with no problems. I wasn't expecting to walk out on Sunday with an Audi, but Adora worked with me to get the deal I was looking for and that was that.

The whole process was pretty painless and I really didn't feel pressured, cornered, intimidated, uncomfortable, etc. throughout the better part of my afternoon. Nobody likes to spend the whole day at the dealership, but if I had to choose one, this would be a good choice."
positive,"I was so pleasantly surprised by the menu at Padres after being sent there by the Volkswagon service department up the road.  I was driving cross country with my boyfriend when the check engine light came on so we had to stop and it was just in time for lunch.

We ordered guacamole and chips which came with three types of salsa.  I had the palin salmon salad, which was cooked just right and had a perfect amount of mexican seasoning for a salad dish.  My boyfriend got the obama burrito, which was extremely tasty and huge!

All I can say is, I wish Padres was near where I live now!"
positive,"hold onto your hats....Ill try not to make this too lengthy.
Soooo took my car in for check engine light.  They called, explained what the (at the time) problem was and recommended some other things.  OK how much?  Oh boy.  Oh well. Get it done!
Marco was kind enough to drop me off at work (thanks Marco) and pick me up as well.  
Get my car, things are running smoothly.  Friday got off early, was going to stop at the casino to put in a bet and BOOM....wouldn't you know it.  Check engine light is back on.  (guess I wasn't supposed to bet that day lol) I called and they said bring it in.  They ran another diagnostic.  This time the throttle body or something was bad.  They tried to clean it to save me some money but that did not work.  Actually the cleaning made it worse.  They kept my car and offered me a loaner car (thanks again).  They had my car all weekend and finally Tuesday night they called to tell me it was ready.  I had just met my family from out of town for dinner so I said I will swing by in the am.  Got my car Wednesday am.  Work is literally 6 minutes down the road so I didn't get to give it a good test run.  Thursday, car running great.  Friday (personal time taken off to be w the fam) I hop in to go and meet the fam at dad's timeshare and 10 minutes into the car ride........here we go again w the check engine.  This time....thermostat.  Lordy, I'm broke now.  Hell I was broke before but now I'm really REALLY broke lol.
Marco made sure to bring me back to show me the reading on the machine reader for the code (appreciate ya).
It's been 5 1/2 days and so far we are looking good.  Jack even called yesterday to see how everything was going.  
NOW....Let's be clear.  The check engine light repeatedly coming on had nothing to do with the work that they had performed.  Each time it was something different.  I was confused, like why won't it just give ALL the codes at once but Jack and Marco patiently explained to me that it just doesn't work that way, especially for older cars.  I've trusted this place since I first met Hamid and now dealing with Marco and Jack for what was every other day, I trust them as well.
Fellas and the mechanic that worked hard on my car, I appreciate you!  Thank you for being patient with my frustrations and my confusion and thank you so much for working with me!
Hope to NOT see you anytime soon lol."
positive,"The service department is amazing.  They came out to greet me before I had even stopped my car.  This was in the middle of summer (July 2017) and it was not pleasant outside.  They collected the information they needed from the car extremely quickly (odometer reading, etc) and I was ushered inside in under two minutes.  

The 2015 subaru WRX I brought in for a repair was having an issue with the CVT (bad choice) transmission was slipping and having rough shifting.  It was an intermittent problem.  The service manager and I went on a test drive but the problem didn't occur this time.  He sent it back to the service department regardless.  They researched the problem and found a software update for the transmission.  It took a while because they had to let the transmission cool down first before they could apply the update.  This was not a problem because their waiting room is amazing.  I swear their kitchen is nicer than most people's homes and it's really a pleasant place to wait.  Giant 75 inch TV's and leather chairs made it easy to spend an hour while they performed the update.  

Subaru of America was terrific as well, as my car was technically out of warranty by nearly 2000 miles but they performed the update for free regardless!  I was very impressed.  The software update was successful.  So far I have not encountered the issue again, but it's only been a day since the update was applied.  

I can't speak for the sales department.

The service department is terrific.  10/10 across the board.  Keep up the good work."
positive,"Friendly neighborhood car repair. I've had my brakes serviced, oil changes, and transmission service. Sometimes there are deals on groupon for car services, and it doesn't hurt to call and ask them to honor the price without purchasing the groupon! I always get my car back in a timely manner, and I appreciate the rides home! Located just north of Cactus on cave creek road, on the east side of the street, across from Home Depot."
positive,"Had the Compustar R3 2-way installed on my manual transmission Impreza. I usually do my own mechanical maintenance but electrical stuff is a bit beyond my expertise. With that said, I wanted someone experienced installing remote engine start on my brand new car. Kyle knows the product like the back of his hand and performs a ""clean"" install using soldering of wires instead of crimping where it is a less reliable connection. I'm really glad I got this installed since I just moved to the area and getting used to my first midwest winter. Will be coming back in the summer for a tint install!"
positive,"Once again, amazing service! Lee and the guys are always so friendly and welcoming there and they take the time to explain what needs to be done. I went in for a smog check and see why my check engine light was on so i can get my registration renewed. They were able to diagnose, order and fix everything in less than 2 days while keeping me updated on the process. It also came out much less than I expected :) I will refer them to anyone! Thanks again Rebel!"
positive,"Yesterday I needed my car diagnosed for a IAC issue. When I initially called I was stressed out and not very nice but they listened and told me to come over. They brought my car right back and ran a few tests. I dealt with Bill, Lorenzo, and Mike. My car needs more tests because it's not throwing a code and the check engine light isn't going on. I'm usually very good at diagnosing my car and these guys did not dismiss me. I apologized for being rude and Lorenzo asked me if I was okay. I broke down into tears and I got a hug. It was certain a bad day! I'll be back on Monday. Lorenzo listened to me and gave me a sympathetic ear. Having car problems at this point in time is the least of my troubles buts nice to know that you have good, honest, mechanics that are there to help and actually care! They will always have my business! They will drive me home when I drop my car off as they have done on the past and will update me on the progress of the tests. The plan is to hook up a computer to my vehicle and drive it to catch the issue. If you need someone who will treat you right go see these guys. I know they are like this at every location as I have had to have my tires checked at a few others. I'm in outbound sales and drive a lot. Trustworthy and transparent are the 2 most important words I can think of with this company."
positive,"My car is a 1955 Buick Special, the transmission was leaking badly that I couldn't be able to drive my car for months. The gaskets were 60 years old as worn out. The transmission works fine even with heavy leaking. I took my car to Buster, and he was very honest and reasonable price to have it fixed. Buster double check inside of transmission to ensure if it needs to be rebuild. He says it is in very good condition as don't need to rebuild. He put new gaskets to stop the leakage. I m amazed at his skills and get things done in time. I would recommend him to any classic or modern cars to be repair. He is the man!"
positive,"Let start off by saying I live at Scottsdale and Shea and drive to 32nd Street and Greenway to go to Community Tire Pros.  Ron and Mike are fantastic!.  There isn't a more honest group of guys around!  

The car's transmission was slipping so we took it in to them to take a look at it.  They did and the total come to $8,500 to fix it.  Now for the good part, Ron did some additional research on the problem.  He had scoured the internet and also called friend who worked for Volvo in town to confirm what he learned.  It was a known issue for Volvo's and the manufacturer might give us some relief on it.  

We picked up the car and took it to Volvo to get it looked at.  They came back with the same problem as Community Tire.  Same price as well.  But the service rep offered to go to Volvo to get me some help to pay for it.  Volvo offered to pay for half.  Prior to the car getting fixed I went over all the repairs Volvo said needed fixed with Ron at Community Tire to verify them and Volvo fixed the car.  Now we are back on the road.  

I just want to point out the they did the best for me, not them.  Not only was I advised on how to get a better deal, Ron also took additional time with me to make sure the fix was right.  They didn't get paid for any of this.  They did the right thing for me.  

I can't say more than this - they will continue to be my auto repair of choice and I will refer all my friends there."
positive,"James Rocks!!! had a problem with emissions, went into here as the are right by me. James told me to come in the next day and we slapped some cats on no problem. I passed emissions no problem. Prices are good, workmanship is great. This is not a huge shop, they can be busy at times, but their work is great. I've found my new muffler shop."
positive,"First time at MB Motors based upon Yelpers' recommendations.  Normally, I would go to the dealership and then cry on the way home after seeing the bill.  Gave these people a chance when my Mercedes had a noise and then showed the check engine light.  I am a cautious person so I was not driving the car with that light on without having a mechanic check it out.  Spoke to Jamie who assured me I could drive it in because it might be spark plugs or something to do with emissions.  As soon as I drove in, Bud, the mechanic/owner identified the noise as having to do with the power steering. Good hearing, experience, or both?  The problem was identified and after I picked up the next day, my car was driving beautiful with no noise and no ""check engine"" light.   I always wish my car repair bill was lower but considering that they also did some brake maintenance work as well,  I think the price would have been significantly higher at the Dealership.  
It was also a nice place to be people-wise.  Jamie, was very nice AND professional.  She also did me a big favor of driving me to a place to eat considering that the pickings are slim in their ""iffy""neighborhood.  Super cool young lady.  Thanks. Jamie."
positive,"I use their specialty (Exhaust) many times over the years.  
They were in a small complex at Dorval St, near Speedy Glass.

Later, they move to this new address and I have been there one time.  
Still, their service is very very good and reasonable too.  Very courteous, just good honest people with good management.
 
It is definitely my top go to place for mufflers.  Wish there are many more of these places these days."
positive,Great place to get your car repaired. They are very trustworthy and very thorough. Tj the owner is a great guy and will take the time to explain things to you. There are a few things I would caution people about but it's nothing too serious. They have longer then most wait times but once again they are very thorough and they will offer you a free ride home. They are not for early risers. Their doors open up between the hours of 0830 and 0945 and it could be later. Also when booking an appointment be advised that it will likely be a week out. Those are just somethings to know but overall it's a great place and I still encourage people to give em a go.
positive,"I was a referral from Decatur Mercedes-Benz auto repair so,I had these guys investigate why my 95 Tahoe work truck was dogging out so bad and I had a hunch it had to do with the exhaust,the owner thought that maybe my catalytic converter might be clogged or the muffler baffles were broken, especially since I have a quarter million miles on the truck. Anyway I just had him replace the catalytic converter and muffler and Its perfect.  The problem ended up being the baffles in the muffler were broken out and causing low flow. Anyway I have no complaints and I don't think these guys racially profile so don't worry about that review.
I also run a automotive type business and it's really nice to run across a company that's competent to do the work and confident at the same time. You guys at Performance rock, thank you, Mike"
positive,I can't believe what a true pleasure it was to actually get me car repaired. I was given a time slot that worked best with my schedule and was in and out in a shorter than anticipated time. My car was maintained in a professional manner and all service people were so friendly. This is my 2nd Maxima and their service is a main reason I'm a repeat customer.
positive,"I have a Late model Chevy Tahoe, I needed a custom Dual Exhaust  which I was quoted as much as $550 from other shops... I have paid upwards of $400 on other custom exhausts for my previous vehicles. (not done at Allstar)

I received this custom dual exhaust from the catalytic converter back for only $200!!!! ( I had my own flowmaster muffler I purchased from Summit Racing) The welds are clean, hangers fitted in the ""right"" places, 2 yr warranty (since its custom), good communication and customer service. Best Quality Best Price Hands down!

Only downside is they left a door open while they did the exhaust which killed my battery, they were quick to give me a jump and it charged back up with no problems...Hey no ones perfect, and I understand that Sh** happens!! no harm no folly!!"
positive,"I'm always nervous to go to mechanics because you always think the mechanics are going to lie to you just to take all your money. But I've been going to this blue diamond location the 2 years I've lived in Vegas because they are honest, hard working, friendly mechanics here that are willing to explain and show you whenever your car is in trouble. The first time I went here was for a simple break replacement.. I usually go shopping while I wait for my car (which is another plus about this location) so as I was browsing Ross one of the employees (I believe he was manager at the time) called me and told me while they were rotating my routers they noticed heat spots or something that was not good.. I kind of panicked and asked if I could see because I was scared of getting ripped off. So they told me to come back so they could show me before they replaced it for me.. In the end they were so helpful and nice that day I kept going back. I get my oil changed regularly here and they help me to upkeep my car for perfect running conditions.. Even when they told me my transmission fluid should be changed I wasn't sure but they were happy to dip a test strip in the transmission fluid and show me it should be changed. Also Jim the manager is so nice and understanding. I always feel like I understand more about my car everytime I visit. Thank you guys for being amazing at what you do!"
positive,"It's hard to be impressed when you go in to a place for a simple oil change but the employees at Econo Lube in Green Valley thoroughly impressed me. I took my Nissan in for a basic oil change before my road trip. I normally go to Jiffy Lube and because I have an SUV I end up paying around $50 when I walk out but at Econo Lube I paid about $30 and got the best service I've ever had. They topped everything off, looked at by brakes, rotated my tires and did a diagnostic check of a check engine light that kept popping up. I also appreciated the fact that they did not try to ""up sell"" the oil change, they kept it sweet and simple and because ""I'm just a girl"" they didn't try and tell me I needed to overhaul my engine ;-). I dealt with John who is the manager and he was super nice and helpful. The only negative thing I can say is that their lobby is TINY but then again aren't all oil service places??

Side note: When I was there a former employee went to have his car serviced simultaneously and the general consensus was this was the best place in town to have your car serviced for minor things."
positive,"I gave this place 5 stars because I can't give it 10! I first found out about this place about 13 years ago when I met Paul the manager at my place of employment.  Shortly after I had a problem with a vehicle, I knew it was going to be expensive but I didn't know who to trust.  I told Paul about the problem and he said that him and his staff could help.  My first thought was ""don't these guys just do brakes, I need transmission work?""  Ultimately my transmission was fixed in a timely manner, fixed properly and at a fair price.  

Since that time I have taken 4 of my other personal vehicles there. I have 4 co-workers who ONLY take their vehicles here. My current vehicle is a Toyota with FREE 24 month/2 year maintenance and an I still went here and PAID! I've taken my girlfriends car here and she's referred 2 of her friends.  All of these people feel they were treated properly and given a fair price.  All of them plan to return if/when they have any vehicle service needs.  I take great pride in being able to send customers and friends to an honest and fair garage. 

Paul gives you an honest assessment of what you need and tells you what can wait if your financially strapped and tells you what needs to be fixed right away.  I have stood and watched El work on my car and he's amazing! I don't even mind staying while my car is being worked on. I have even stayed and ate lunch with them twice. This place ROCKS!"
positive,"Great crew here at performance mufflers shop. They took their time to make sure it was done right. Very reasonable price. Joe was great , he was able to get me in without appointment. Definitely coming back for future customization/ repair needs."
positive,"The manager at this location, Roc, was very friendly. He took the time to explain not only what needed to be done but also functionalities of the parts that needed to be serviced. The check engine light was on and before spending thousands of dollars to get the problem fixed at their shop, they did have us check the warranty on the car first. The service was quick and honest. They looked for problems that wouldn't be the most expensive, where as most places would have just ripped me off. Roc and his team did not do this. They took our concerns very seriously and kept us updated on our vehicle. When one thing didn't work they kept moving along until the problem was found, agaim starting at what would cost the least to fix and working up. I appreciated that all the work done was in the same day and that even as more costumers came in our car wasn't put aside. 
In my visit, I saw that they were very accommodating to the needs of their costumers. Roc was very forward about costs and time of services. 
We will continue to use this location and business for all of our auto needs. I would recommend this place to my family and friends."
positive,"First time doing business with All Pro. Offered free towing to pick our car up from our home. Were very thorough in making sure it was not a transmission problem and even towed our car for free to Brake Masters so we could find the problem (which we did). They made sure to make the process as easy as possible. Very nice guy, and  although we didn't end up having any actual work done on our vehicle, the diagnostic price was more than fair. He went above and beyond to accommodate our hectic schedule."
positive,"We were traveling from Henderson, NV to southern Arizona when our check engine light came on. We were close to Casa Grande, so we took our Cadillac SUV to Auto Zone to have the code read. We found out the problem and promptly went to GMC since there wasn't a Cadillac dealer there. We explained to them that we were traveling with our 94 year-old grandfather when they told us they couldn't fit us in that day. Once they heard that, they did everything they could to try and accommodate us. They were, unfortunately, able to fit us in, but they found the repair was still covered under our power train warranty. I called Cadillac in Tucson. They were going to be closing soon (this was about 3:00pm), and said they couldn't do it that day. Since the nice service guys at GMC told us we were still warrantied, I asked Cadillac if we could get s loaner until we came back through Tucson in a couple of days. Once I asked him that, he decided to hold a service guy late so they could perform the repairs as soon as we got there! Had we not found out we were under warranty, repairs would not have happened that day!! We are very thankful!!"
positive,Needed some mufflers installed on my mustang.  They got me in and out in an hour for a great price.  Place is not much to look at but they know their stuff and I'm happy.
positive,This is the second time I have taken my trucks to busters Transmission Service and once again they did miracles long story short this is a 2001 Chevy 1500 Z 71 which the transmission decided to grenade itself it was so bad that it basically threw all of the gears except first so I decided once again I will send my truck to Dan at busters transmission well he made it happen. He not only completely rebuilt my transmission he made it better I am extremely pleased and also they didn't just fix my transmission they fix the brakes on the truck as well they locked up and broke and they replaced everything and fixed it for me again if you need a good transmission service and all-around great mechanics you need to bring your truck or car to them they will take care of you and will help you out anyway that they possibly can thank you guys at busters Transmission Service again for a great job
positive,"Perfect location on the right side of South Blvd. for my daily commute. Now you can order online, pay with PayPal and pick up in the store for a swift transaction. In addition, they seem to always have coupons and deals for 15-20% off for online orders. I highly recommend going this route.

The store is well stocked with the basics for auto repair in your own driveway. Tools including socket sets, spark plugs, new batteries, aftermarket air intakes, muffler tips. Accessories including license plate borders, sticker letters/numbers if you want to make your Camry a 4x4 or make your F150 a Camry, seat and steering wheel covers, novelty valve stem caps, etc.

Staff is friendly and helpful. You can get your battery checked and of course replaced if necessary. It doesn't seem to me that they rig their machine to give a bad reading in their favor. They'll also help you install your newly purchased windshield wipers. Good shop for all those general auto-owner needs!"
positive,"I couldn't find #1 Transmission here on Yelp but felt it was important to add it! If you look at the Google reviews you will find them at 4.9 star rating with lots of great reviews. 
My transmission went out on my 2007 Camry and with money being quite a huge issue as I'm on a fixed income (but aren't we all!) I had several options to choose from, and with a brand new transmission being quoted at $4229 on a 10+ year old car I didn't think that was the way for me to go. I got quotes from several places to rebuild, & to drop in a used tranny w/60,000 miles.. prices ranged but Mario gave me a good price w/warranty of 12mos/12,000 miles. Which was also the going ""rate"" from other places however Mario was much more helpful than the other places, he also allowed someone to call in credit card info to pay for it where other places would not do! Which was my saving grace! 

My car was done for a good price, service was above others, and car was done when they said it would be done! I'll be bringing my car here for all future repairs as they aren't just a transmission repair they do
All automotive repairs/service and for a fair price!! Mario quoted me some other things that I need to have done & it was over $50 cheaper than Purrfect Auto- which has terrible reviews and it's also where I pulled my car from originally! Their quoted price for tranny repair went up $100 every time I spoke to them! 
So THANK YOU MARIO you were wonderful & very patient with me!"
positive,"I had my 1971 Ford F250 brought in on crutches. It wouldn't start and transmission seemed to act funny prior to that. Made an appointment with Brad. Jeff who did the work was very busy but he did get to it. After the initial troubleshooting with compression tests it was brought to my attention that two cylinders were misfiring badly. The diagnosis was it might need a engine overhaul or new one with estimate north of $1500. I was very nervous and Brad must have felt this because the next call was the following day. After looking underneath the valve covers, Jeff found one bent push rod, carburetor fuel /air was out of adjustment, bad fuel pump, bad main gas tank (auxilllary OK) which explained the odd behavior of the transmission. Jeff fixed all the problems except the gas tank. It is filled with crap and I will probably have it replaced. I stress your mechanics are just people too, especially when they've been dealing with a problem child before yours. Give them some room to figure it out and you will be glad you did. I gladly, paid $460 cash for a great job. My truck passed emissions that weekend and it even runs better than it did before it stopped. The shop is kind of hidden next to another shop and needs a bigger building or sign. Thank you guys!"
positive,We went to Joes by chance. We were actually on our way to another shop when our check engine light started flashing so we immediately pulled into the closest place which was Joes. The guy who helped us was really nice and they took care of the issue. Not sure how their prices compare since we didn't really have an option to shop around but it didn't seem too bad for everything they had to do to get the truck running. Would definitely go back.
positive,"These guys are great! 

When the owner of this business left his previous location to work for himself (was working at one of the big chains previously), I happily started getting my oil changed here... And more!!

I own old vehicles. Kris is an honest guy and he actually told me to stop spending money on one of my vehicles! He knew that the new replacement truck I got would mean I'd only need him for oil changes instead of coming through every few months to fix the next thing that died on my old truck. Now that's an honest auto guy. 

I have always found them friendly and helpful, but their knowledge, expertise, honesty, and great work ethic is what really keeps me coming back and referring my friends. 

I can't believe that I had never left them a review and that no one else had (other than 1 person who apparently found them on their lunch break?)

From oil changes to transmission repair, you will not regret checking these guys out! Really!

Can you tell I'm impressed!?"
positive,"I read the reviews on here and decided that it was time to give Ron's a shot.  I stopped in on Veteran's Day to get my oil changed. Met Jasen was very impressed by his professional attitude.  After my oil change was complete, Jasen took me out to my car and explained that it might be time to do the transmission fluid change.  I agreed to the $150 service and waited for it to be done.  I paid a total of around $180 and went home satisfied.  I noticed a drop of oil in my driveway when I got home but thought it was just residual oil from the service.  Friday evening, I notice that my car has left a puddle of oil\fluid in my garage.  I immediately went inside, scheduled an appointment online for Saturday morning and intended on going in at 8.  Jasen got my appointment request and called me Friday night to confirm the issue and have me bring it in.  Saturday morning I arrive at 8 and am greeted by staff who take my car right back.  Moments later, I meet Ron (Owner) who was very friendly and explained what happened - the tech accidently overfilled my transmission fluid and it was leaking.  Ron and his tech installed the proper amount of transmission fluid, power washed the bottom of my car and provided me with a coupon for a free car wash.  The big surprise was when Ron handed me a check for the original $180 I had paid - I was shocked.  Ron even offered to come to my house and power wash my driveway because of the mistake.  Couldn't help but to be impressed by the service I received and though a mistake was made, the staff went above and beyond to make it right.  I have every intention of taking my vehicle back to Ron's and suggesting them to friends\family.  I fully expected to have to haggle them on the repair but that never happened - Ron stated that ""This isn't the way we do business"" and I certainly believe it.  Thanks Ron, Jasen and staff for making it right and earning a customer for life."
positive,"MUNICH MOTORS is the best. Top quality work, Good prices and ZERO BS!  They have done work on my e30 and e36 m3. These guys know what they are doing, they have saved me time and money because of their expert level of knowledge. If you're buying a used bmw take it to them for a pre purchase inspection...for a small fee they take just about all of the risk out of buying privately owned BMW and MERCEDES BENZS. Plus they have a pre owned lot of really clean cars. Now they are working on a 5 speed manual transmission swap for me and I have no doubt that it is gonna be perfect. I'll update when I get the car back,  I wouldn't even attempt a job like this with any other shops. But MUNICH MOTORS has my full trust and respect. And I don't trust anyone without out them earning it. I've been a German car enthusiast for over 15 years. I've worked in the industry as Starmark lot manager, and a gopher for several MB, BMW DEALERSHIPS. I'm thoroughly impressed and will continue to give them top notch reviews because they have earned that respect. Give them a chance and I can damn near guarantee you will be satisfied and then some. BEST BMW/BENZ SHOP IN PHOENIX."
positive,"My check engine light was on, so I brought it in to see what was going on. Turns out, since my car is from CA, it was on because it would have failed the smog test. Since Arizona has no smog test, which they told me, I didn't need to get it fixed. It would have required replacing the parts responsible for the smog test, about $750 each, but since I'm not going to California, they said I didn't have to do the repair if I didn't want to. They only billed me for the labor costs, and that was very cheap at just $50. I highly recommend you go to this place for repairs or even to just see what's up with your car."
positive,"I have so many good things to say about my experiences here I don't know where to begin.  I bought my Sportwagen TDI from Camelback VW because that dealership was affiliated with Costco.  I got a good price, but the experience was unpleasant and my first service experience there was catastrophically bad, causing me to seek out another dealership.  

To date, VW North Scottsdale has performed the 10k, 20k, 30k, 40k, and DSG service on my car, as well as some warranty work.  Each experience has been phenomenal.  Tom Radtke is my service rep, and he is AWESOME.  There's no other way to say it.  He is super pleasant to speak with, has great follow through and communication, and actually listens to what I tell him about my car.  You will never be disappointed with Tom.

To give a little context to my review:  I had an Audi and a Mercedes before my VW, and the level of service offered by Tom and VW North Scottsdale eclipses that of the nearby Audi and Mercedes dealerships.  I consider myself car enthusiast and I historically do most of the work on my cars myself (timing belt changes, control arm replacements, brake jobs, transmission services, etc.).  I know my way around a car and I know when something is not working correctly.  

The typical experience when you present a car problem to a dealer or independent is dismissal, unless it is something completely obvious, like a front end collision.  If it is a complaint that the service provider is not familiar with, you are dismissed as paranoid or irrational.  For example, I had an issue with my car shortly after purchase and had it towed to Camelback VW.  I was subsequently treated with condescension and mockery, and charged nearly $300 to fix the problem.  Recently, Tom and his crew diagnosed this very same problem as a warranty issue and fixed it, at no cost to me.  It was a completely different experience.

I initially brought my car to the VW dealership because the first three services are free.  I continue to take my car to Tom at VW North Scottsdale and pay for it because they do such a fantastic job.  VW North Scottsdale presents such good value and makes the service experience so pleasant I would now prefer to pay them to service my car rather than do the work myself.

Tom has always been my contact at VW North Scottsdale and I cannot say enough good things about him, but I also want to say his crew who does the actual work on the car is awesome too.  Collectively, they make a great team."
positive,"Amazing!!! This muffler shop is very good. They are clean, friendly and professional. I had some custom piping done and added a resonator to a bolt on exhaust that was just too loud.  When they were done it looked like I bought it that way. I found this place because a neighbor recommended them to me. Now I am recommending them to all. They get very busy though so I recommend calling for an appointment."
positive,"We hit a hunk of metal something-or-other on an Interstate exit ramp that left the car sounding like the muffler had been punctured. The fellow at this Meineke location squeezed us in without an appointment, called soon after to report a couple of broken clamps, and for about $170, we were on our way again. Our fears of them ""sticking it"" to a couple of out-of-owners were completely unfounded. If they do such good work this fairly for strangers, I would have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone lucky enough to live in their neighborhood."
positive,"We've been to Buddys twice now. Once for an engine replacement. We called several places, and we got quotes for double what Buddys quoted us. We did get a used engine but we discussed this in length with Jason and decided it was the best option for us. The car ran great for months until the check engine light went off. We took it in again, and found out it was the temp gauge (which we had suspected). The price was reasonable and they turned around the fix within hours. We even took the car to Vegas after and it drove smoothly. Very happy so far with Jason and Buddys!"
positive,"Cliff and Craig took very good care of me and my 2008 Honda Civic and made a long-time customer out of me.

After having my oil changed at a shop down the street that quoted me in excess of $400 for a myriad of recommended repairs, I asked Brake Masters for a second opinion. 

First and foremost, the customer service was phenomenal. The wait wasn't long to inspect and clean my brakes, flush the transmission fluid, and replace my air filters. The team communicated often concerning their findings and the cost was much less than the first shop. They saved me a brake job, power steering flush, money, and more importantly, time. I felt as though they valued my patronage and sought to provide the best service possible -- an invaluable yield for any service provider."
positive,"These guys were honest!  

I had issues with the 2nd gear grinding, so I took it to Crawford Transmission.  I was expecting a bill of around $2,000.  That seems to be the average for transmission replacement and repair.  They guy from Crawford's took it for a test drive, and then showed me a part that had simply come loose.  He re-fastened it for Free!

It's hard to find such honest people in the car repair business."
positive,"As most VW/Audi drivers know, these are awesome cars until a check engine light comes on.  Having only driven VW/Audi's my whole life I'm used to this and accept it because when they are running great they are fantastic cars to drive.  You also learn very early that it takes a special mechanic with the skills and knowledge to accurately work on these vehicles.  Well, look no further because this shop can fix anything.

About a year ago I let a friend who hadn't driven stick in a while drive my car home from the bar and it was a HUGE MISTAKE.  He somehow managed to stall the car extremely violently, but the car restarted and it wasn't until the next day that I saw the dreaded CEL.  I noticed a considerable loss of power and torque and was scared something catastrophic had happened to the engine.  I took it to a shop in Cleveland where I had just got transferred to for work and the guy said he loved to work on audi's and that it shouldn't be a problem.  Well, almost $2,000 dollars later the car was still not running right.  I was so frustrated that I just dealt with it until I was transferred back to Pittsburgh and couldn't take it anymore.

I read the reviews for this shop and decided I'd give it a shot.  Immediately after walking in you know this shop specializes in VW/Audi, which was a relief for me.  They say if you can fix those cars you can probably fix anything.  I talked to Greg when I dropped my car off and felt a lot better about the situation knowing these guys could handle it.  Greg was able to diagnose the problem that the other guy couldn't and make a great suggestion to save me more money down the road.  Well, I picked my car up last night and couldn't believe my eyes when the check engine light was off and the car drove amazing on the way home, it felt like a brand new car.  I'm so thankful that they finally fixed it and really took the time to explain (Greg and Rock) and answer any questions even though they are super busy.

As long as I'm in the area they have a customer for life.  Hopefully, my car isn't going back anytime soon though."
positive,"I had my Lexus only 1 week when I was hit in the side by a truck in a parking lot.  Needless to say, I was very skeptical as to how it would look after it was repaired, especially matching the paint.  I was reassured by Caliber that it would look as good as new.  We were updated by text at every step.  And, when we picked it up, we were pleasantly surprised, because it did look as good as new.  Even my husband, who used to paint vehicles, said they did a great job matching the paint.  Hopefully, I won't need their services again, but if I ever need a car repaired, I will definitely use Caliber Collision on WT Harris Blvd."
positive,"Amazing customer service in the service department! Drove from Cali at 4am and check engine light came on at 7am. They took my car in without appt at 9am and got it back the same day. Since I'm from out of state and had no appt, I had been denied any service at other Chevy dealer in Vegas. Henderson Chevy was nothing but helpful and quick. Andy, you are awesome! Thank you Henderson Chevy for making my business to Nevada successful and as stress free as possible. :)"
positive,"Have purchased two vehicles through AutoNation Scion Tempe, and have always been treated great by Eddie and his great team down there. Scheduling appointments is extremely easy, and any issues that have arisen with my vehicle under warranty were always honored. In fact, when the throwout bearing (under powertrain warranty) went out on my car and resulted in significant smoke/burn damage to my clutch (manual transmission), AutoNation ensured that I would have a new clutch replaced on my vehicle as well. This was a class act on their part, and I respect the service reps at this location along with the management. 

Will always use AutoNation, and I have had no significant issues with any appointments at this dealership. Would recommend to a friend, as I believe they are very trustworthy."
positive,"Had my car towed to Bell Lexus after the engine caught on fire.

When I took it home, the check engine light came back on.

They gave me a loaner car for $10.00 and discovered the VVT valve was bad NOT related to the fire.

Replace the Oil Control Valve and sent me on my way.

Would NEVER go anywhere else for service on my Lex, these guys rock!"
positive,"My dreaded check engine light was on and I was told at auto zone that it could be a number of issues. I was referred by a friend to check out Mello Motives, Tim and his crew were able to get my vehicle in assess the problem. They could have really taken me to the cleaner but I was in and out with a new temperature check gauge and my car is running beautifully again! To say that I'm highly satisfied is an understatement, don't hesitate to trust this team for your next car needs."
positive,Just want to say a big thank you to everybody at ultimate collision.. Dennis was amazing and helped me tremendously the work was flawless and I could not be more happy with my car! and the work that they did made it look just like the day I bought it which is only two months ago! They take pride in their customer service and their work if you're going to go get your car repaired anywhere please go here and contact Dennis! Five stars from me and I will refer everybody to this establishment!
positive,"I decided to go here bc of the great yelp reviews. found out for myself they are excellent. Very nice and professional. they replaced my needed part and my check engine light came on again right after (frustrating, but it happens), so I was able to bring it right back and they replaced a couple hoses to that part and it took care of the problem. it is working great now. highly recommend."
positive,"These guys were fast, friendly, and efficient. Brandon topped off the washer fluid, balanced the tire pressure, and checked the transmission fluid, coolant, and battery, all before the oil change was complete. As I was being rung up, I got an apology for them being ""backed up"". I waited maybe 15 minutes, and the oil change only took 15 minutes! Not only is this team faster than Terrible Herbst, they're less expensive, much friendlier, and work with a sense of urgency. I got there around 8:30 AM, so my assumption is, the earlier you get there the better, because by the time I left they had 2 lines each 3 cars deep. Again, big thanks to this team on restoring my faith; I've had nothing but bad experiences w/service stations AND dealerships, but these guys were great."
positive,"I have been taking all of my vehicles to Desert Car Care for a couple of years now and have always been pleased with the results.  They have performed fluid changes, brakes, transmission services, and other repairs.  They are prompt and I have never had any charges that were not reasonable.  I recommend them to anyone that needs auto repair and maintenance."
positive,"The staff there are friendly. The damage was minor but it took two weeks to get the car repaired because every time we were told it was ""ready"" it wasn't.  We had color matching issues. Our claims rep, Erin, was great though!"
positive,"Rolf and Chris of framers workshop provide a transcendental service:   They
transform and elevate art into finished and focused pieces to be treasured as a legacy.   The
technique, expertise, and discernment exhibited by their matting and framework
Never ceases to astonish the eye.   I just
Had a complex pastel on paper framed
With extraordinary results.   Rolf even
Framed a painted car muffler for me on
Oak plinth with plexiglass a few years ago.   If you would like to experience
the pinnacle of the art of framing, come
to Framer's Workshop!"
positive,"I took my son there to have a performance muffler to put on his car. Jonny and Scott were the 2 guys that helped us out and they were really knowledgeable about what they do and very informative. 

They offered some suggestions as to which muffler is the best fit for what my son wants for look and sound.

They wasted no time ordering the muffler and within 2 hours my son had exactly what he wanted on his car. I highly recommend this place and either of these guys to do the work.

Its kind of funny because Jonny sounds exactly like the character Seth from the movie Superbad! Just a little side note but back on track I go...Check them out if you need a muffler, they will do a great job!"
positive,"In reading the previous reviews, people either seem to love this place or hate it -- put me in the first group. My car  -- suddenly and without notice -- started sounding like a 1970's hooptie Datsun with a bad muffler. I took it in, they put it off on the lift, and showed me how the pipe holding the muffler to the catalytic converter was corroded and probably just jarred loose while going over a bump. They dropped me off at Chinook Center to kill time (only about an hour and a half) and boom -- it was done, and for about $300 (which is exactly what I expected.) No up-selling, no replacing anything which didn't need replacing. Straight-up guys; respectful, and great at what they do."
positive,"I was very impressed by the professionalism and expertise of the whole team at AAMCO Transmissions.  Not only they treat their customers very well but they are highly skilled.

I went to see AAMCO Transmissions after visiting three other car mechanics about one problem with my car; a loud vibrating noise starting at speeds above 50mph.  The results from the visits at other automotive shops ranged from offering to charge me for standard safety checks that may or may not be related to the actual problem, to actually proceeding to unnecessary part replacement, to complete misdiagnosis of the problem at the transmission level.  In sharp contrast, AAMCO offered to diagnose the car for free, including the transmission, found the actual problem - a part under the hood was slightly loose and would start flapping when too much air would get under - and fixed it for free.  When this was done, one of the franchise owners - Brian - drove the car with me to make sure the problem was solved.

In addition to fixing your problems, these guys are also very friendly and professional.  I only wish all car mechanics would have this type of work ethics."
positive,"This is the best mechanic experience I have had in years. Tim is honest, knowledgable and plesant to work with. I had dialed Mr. Mechanic thinking I was calling another muffler shop. Awesome mistake! I drove 23 miles at the last minute for him to put on a catalytic converter and  a thermostat. 2 hours later it was done and the price was 50% lower than a quote I had. I was ready to donate my vehicle until then.  I will be going back for him to fix my cvs axle and boot. I would give this mechanic 10 stars."
positive,"My husband,and i helped a little bit, used the self service at u fix it. i can say that we are extremly happy with how it turned out. shop was clean, organized and customercare was outstanding.
I know we saved about 300$ by bleeding the breakes and changing the transmission fluid ourself.instead of 80-120$ an hour we payed 20$ for the lift and 10$ for specialty tools...this includes good adwise from realy good tecs.
So if you know what you do and dont have a problem to get dirty yourself this is the place to be."
positive,"Highly recommend. I have taken my Jeep in for: oil changes, spark plug replacement, coolant and transmission flushes/exchanges. John Jay has been straightforward, honest, and prices his services very reasonably. John Jay has earned the right to be my new mechanic and I trust anyone who takes their vehicle to his shop will be equally satisfied."
positive,"I just took my Z4 to these guys after getting ripped off at the dealer over and over.  I can't believe how much cheaper the prices were than my previous repairs were from the BMW dealer.  Bryan was the mechanic and he fixed my check engine light.  As a woman you have to be very careful when going to some random mechanic.  Suzette was amazing, she explained to me the whole process and the prices were very fair.  i would recommend this shop to anyone who has a BMW or MINI!!!"
positive,"My 2003 F150 could not have gotten better care! I took my truck to Rebel Automotive on the recommendation of a friend. Another shop had diagnosed my truck as in need of ball joints but balked when I gave them my extended warrantee information so I decided to get another opinion. Lee at Rebel took my short list of complaints , some noise and vibration issues, and went with me for a test drive asking me to indicate the sounds and vibrations as I noticed them. Not some around the block test drive , we drove about 10 miles before Lee was fully satisfied. I left Lee my warrantee information and my truck. Four hours later Lee called me to let me know that he had rotated my tires and rebalanced one of the rears and the vibration was gone. He went on to tell me that I needed to replace my transmission mount ( one of my complaints ) and both engine mounts were badly rotted. Lee had already called and gotten approval for the repairs and we set up a time for me to return for the repairs. Incidentally, Lee assured me that there was nothing wrong with my ball joints. 

After setting up a tentative date to perform the repairs, lee and I discussed an air conditioning problem I was having. Lee promised to check that for me when next my truck was in. 

When the chassis issues were rectified, ( in a very prompt ) fashion, Lee called me with a time estimate for the A/C repairs, he also told me that he had received authorization from my warrantee to proceed with that repair as well. I was thrilled and authorized the repairs. 

I left Rebel automotive a very happy customer having had all my issues resolved, a fraudulent claim avoided and only having to make two trips and pay two $50 deductibles and a very reasonable fee for the tire work and an oil change. I figure if this keeps up I'll keep my truck another 10 years with Lee and Rebel Automotive's help. Five Stars!"
positive,"These guys were extremely accommodating. We were towing through town when we started having some problems with our truck. Mike answered my call and made my vehicle his priority. Unfortunately the problem wasn't an easy fix and I ultimately needed a new transmission. Within an hour of leaving Sun, I was having my truck towed to the dealership. This was hard to stomach after spending over $700 at Sun Auto.  When I asked at the dealership, the employees there stated that Sun Auto is extremely reputable. Based on their customer service I would return."
positive,"5 STARS PLUS!!! Munich Motors is a top level, masterful mechanic shop. They have just completed an automatic to manual transmission swap on my e36 m3. If you don't already know, this is a major project to take on. This is not the kind of thing that  just any shop will, or CAN do. The finished project is flawless, not to say that there wasn't any hiccups during the process but,  the extremely diligent manner in which they handled the issues was just more reassurance of how capable and honest they are. The whole project took a little more than 4 weeks, it was drivable after 3 weeks, there  was just a few small ""buttoning up"" type of return trips to Munich Motors. To be clear that was part of the plan from the beginning so there were almost no suprises. Grant kept in touch with me regularly because he knew that this project was a big deal to me , so he gave me updates several times a week or whenever a major part of the project was completed then informed me as to what was next. I greatly appreciated that courtesy especially because they are a busy garage yet still gave me a lot of personal attention, taking the time to explain all the technical processes in a way that a non-mechanic could understand. Although this was an expensive undertaking it wasn't because  of Munich Motors . 
The Boss, Grant,  actually made  sure that he and his master tech, Graham, did everything they could to keep costs down. Mostly by being extremely generous with the man hours. The cost for parts was also low. On a lot of the parts they made no profit and I simply paid what it cost them. They also did a lug stud conversion, spacers, and got me new tires for less then I would have paid anywhere else.  Bottom line, they took excellent care of me and my car. Grant even gifted me an $80 shift knob, which I would have bought anyway but that's how much they value their customers.  Mechanics of this caliber are rare. I will literally NEVER take my M3 anywhere else. DON'T HESITATE TO TAKE YOUR BMW OR MERCEDES BENZ TO MUNICH MOTORS THEY WILL DO THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE. other shops MAY be able to do what Munich Motors does but I wouldn't even consider it personally. If you want your  German car taken care of properly just go to MUNICH MOTORS. you will not be disappointed."
positive,"Don't let the fact that it is a part of a 'chain' put you off. They are as close to a neighbor business as it gets. The manager Todd, seemed to know (many by name) more than half the customers that came in while I was waiting, and you could tell they were happy customers, coming back for regular service.

I have been here in the past for an alignment and was pleased and went back for a few  30,000 mile service items that I do not do myself (I am old school and still do my own oil/rotate tires/wipers, etc). They were among the cheapest of the non dealers I called after you check for coupons on the web. AND, they ended up being slightly less than they quoted me on the phone as the Trans flush required slightly less fluid than standard. 

Service was even done slightly ahead of schedule! (PS - Several eating establishments in the same parking lot if you decide to wait)"
positive,"I recently had a tensioner replaced on my Audi A5, the car was in and out within an hour and the parts and labor were reasonably priced. This is the second service I had on this car, my previous service was a transmission flush and SS brake line install each time the service has been timely and of high quality. 

In addition to the service they performed, they have also loaded an APR stage 2+ file on the A5. Unless there is a absolute need to take my car to an Audi dealership, AZ Euros will be my first stop to service the three Audi's in my stable."
positive,"I called a lot of different places cause my transmission needed some maintenance! All quoted me $2,500 to $3,500! I called this place they did less then $2,000. Plus fix my oil leak! And was still less then $2,000. Very helpful friendly and won't rip u off! Recommend this place to any one!"
positive,Geico referred me to Caliber as a preferred repair shop. The attention to detail and consistent communication keeping me posted about repair status was exemplary. Brought car home and noted the auto lock on drivers door with FOB in my pocket no longer worked. Called and spoke with the manager and we arranged to have it looked at this morning. Less than 30 minutes later the door works fine and they even installed a new headlamp housing I had purchased on my own. Bottom line is that the customer service and expert technical service have been wonderful through the stressful process of having my car repaired back to the rythym of my life. Thanks you guys.
positive,Amazing service!! The flange from my exhaust was missing and Nissan wanted to charge me $280 plus labor for a REPLACEMENT muffler! The team here took me in quickly and fixed my car within 30 mins for a fraction of what I might've paid. My brother is in the automotive industry and he and a few of my friends recommended JPG Exhaust- SO happy I came here!
positive,"I am so thrilled with my new exhaust setup installed this afternoon.  Joe really knows his stuff and they are an extremely busy muffler shop.  Clean, honest and dependable mechanics very capable of doing custom muffler work to your everyday solutions to pass smog.

I originally came to see them because I used them about 10 years ago when I had another modified vehicle that I did custom work on.  They were professional then and I knew in the back of my mind I was going to see if they were still in business.  Luckily they were and Joe suggested I buy the pre packaged Bassani X Pipe online and they would install it for only $140!  Extremely reasonable, especially for the simple fact I don't have a lift in my garage.  I dropped it off at 8AM this morning and it was done just after 1PM.  When I came to pick up my stang I knew immediately they got the right look I was looking for.  He also hooked me up with two chrome tips for only $100!

Extremely reasonable shop and nice employees.  They're very busy, so be patient if you're looking for quality work.  Would use again."
positive,"We originally took our 1998 Jeep Cherokee to a transmission shop close to our home. I had warned my husband about how some shops will try to tell you right off the bat that you need a rebuild done (have experienced this many times in the past). The first shop gave us some crazy number of $1500 plus and that may not even solve the problem. So we decided to take it to AAMCO for a second opinion. Ricardo called and told us that they would require a few hours of labor to dive into the transmission and try to solve the problem for us. No matter how long it took, he would only charge us for two hours. That was cool with us. We heard from him the next day and he informed us that they couldn't diagnose the issue and most likely it had to do with the Electronic Control Module and that we should take it to a place that could look further into that. He also decided to not charge us anything for the time spent looking for the transmission issues. We ended up fixing the issue ourselves by cleaning the plugs on the ECM. If it weren't for Ricardo's honesty and idea to check the ECM, we would have most likely spent a fortune on fixing an issue that didn't exist- like what the first transmission shop wanted to charge for. In a world of repair shops that insist on raking people over the coals, it's nice to have a place like this AAMCO and someone like Ricardo who tells the truth and gives you great advice on top of it. Thank  you Ricardo!"
positive,"I have an 8 year old Mercedes C280 with 90,000 miles on it and the transmission started giving problems. I wouldn't consider taking it to a dealer and instead took it to one place that was highly recommended - and got an estimate for $2,200. But I didn't feel confident in them. So I brought it to M.B. Motors and was immediately impressed with their knowledge and professionalism. They pinpointed the problem very quickly and repaired it within a couple of days. The final bill was $1,500 and they did a super job. From now on I'll use them exclusively for all my servicing needs."
positive,"I have been taking my car here for a few months now for oil changes and other services. I am really happy with their efficiency, customer service and honesty. As a woman, I know I have been lied to in the past when having my car worked on. Fortunately, I know a fair amount about cars as my dad taught me, and am able to tell when mechanics are trying to make a sale for the most part. I have NEVER had that experience here. They have earned my business for more that just tires and oil changes- I recently had my brakes and rotors replaced and will have my transmission fluid changed very soon. Their prices are fair- I am sure on some services you could find slightly cheaper prices ($5-20 maybe), but overall I think they are competitively priced, and you're paying for quality work."
positive,"Sun Auto Service is a life saver! My fiancé and I were traveling from Southern California to Utah when we had unexpected car problems. I called and spoke to Jimmy on the phone and he told me to head in and he would immediately diagnose the issue and get everything fixed. We arrived at 4pm and Jimmy was able to diagnose the issue, get in contact with my warranty company, get the repairs approved and order the parts before 6pm. Turns out I needed to have my water pump and alternator replaced.

They were friendly, informative and well equipped to help. They had our car repaired by 10am the next morning and we were back on the road with no further issues. I highly recommend any of the Sun Auto locations in the Las Vegas area, they will go the extra mile to help you. All things considered they helped turn what could have been a horrible road trip experience into a pleasant and speedy bump in the 'road'. The guys here couldn't have been nicer."
positive,Awesome place.  We went to see if we needed a new muffler.  Most business would have said yes and charged accordingly.  He took a look and said a seal was blown.  Promply replaced it while we were out shopping and now our son's truck sounds quiet as a mouse.  Highly recommend this place.  :)
positive,"I have been to this shop several times having my car repaired over the last couple of years, and have NEVER had a problem with any of the work performed.  Every single time that I have been in, they have diagnosed, ordered parts for, and repaired my car in a timely manner.  Prices are VERY reasonable in comparison to other shops around town.  This is a ""mom and pop"" shop with a staff that is very knowledgeable in the repair field.  I wouldn't take my car anywhere else to be repaired.  The owner, John, is super friendly, listens to what your problem is and makes sure that everything is repaired the first time through.  I have had such services as A/C compressor replacement, emissions system work, water pump replacement as well as general maintenance.  Don't trust your car to just anyone, make the drive to Glendale Repairs and you won't be disappointed."
positive,"I first had my transmission rebuilt by Cottman's in February. Through a series of unfortunate events, I ended having to go back to them several times over the next few months. I have to say that initially I was skeptical that they would be able to resolve my issues to my satisfaction, but the GM, Bard, made sure I was satisfied, even extending my warranty because of the delay. Although things did not go perfectly, Bard and his staff were committed to making sure I was happy. That means a lot in today's environment of indifferent customer service. I have returned twice since for minor problems unrelated to the original repairs, and was extremely pleased with the service. I would absolutely recommend this company based on my personal experience."
positive,"Great Service - Great Prices!

The people who work here know what they're talking about and won't fix something that isn't broken. In fact, if you're doing something wrong, they'll show you how to do it right.

While I was waiting for my oil change; I wandered around the show room and spotted some really cool new syles available from really good Taiwanese Brands. If you want something that's not on the floor they'll order it for you, same day.

[If you don't know, Chinese brands are TERRIBLE and super cheap; BUT TAIWANESE brands are great -all the best manufacturing in the world occurs in Taiwan and Japan; semi-conductors/computer chips/engines/scooters -FYI]

When I got my scooter back, it ran better than ever! 
-It cost $30 for an engine oil change, transmission oil change and break check.

....now I want the laid-back Cali. touring scooter for cruising Tempe this summer (brand new it's under $2K for a 125cc!!!!!wow!!!)"
positive,check engine light came back on. Stopped in immediately....will update review when I get my car back. Don't want to give lower stars to mess up their rating if handled properly. Keep ya posted
positive,"These guys (along with my brother's extensive tool collection) have kept my 1995 E320 wagon going for over 211,000 miles. They are amazing. Great prices and free shipping on orders over $50. I ordered two flex disks and a transmission mount yesterday late morning and they were just delivered today at 9:30 am.  Can't beat that."
positive,"Before finding the guys at Huntersville Auto Tech I'd never been to the same shop twice to have my car repaired.  Since I found them, I haven't been to anyone else.  

You'll be treated fairly, if your car doesn't need to be fixed, they'll tell you.  If your car does need to be fixed, you'll get the most fair price you've ever gotten, and the work will be done right.  They also don't take a week to do a one or two day job.  If they had 6 stars they would get it."
positive,"I took my old 2002 Rav 4 to Firestone for an oil
change and I was told it needed 2 rear shocks, 2 front bushings, 2 arms, a transmission mount, and all 4 tires. Imagine my horror when they told me how much it would cost. I thought about getting rid of the car for good, despite its 3-yo transmission, because everytime I go to Firestone, they seem to find something that's wrong with it, costing me a lot of money. I mean it's an old car but I maintained it. I'm so glad I used Yelp and found H Tech Auto. I called them up and took the car there. Bernard was very helpful. Norman did the diagnostics, and he showed and explained to me what needed to be done. I was shocked that it only needed 2 rear shocks and a transmission mount as opposed to everything  Firestone wanted to do to that would've costed me a lot, just for the labor alone. Norman also found that Firestone over tightened the cap when they did my oil change, causing the washer to crack and the oil to leak out. They quoted me with a significantly lower price (parts and labor), only for the necessary things to be done and nothing more. I was very happy! Bernard even offered to take me to and pick me up from work when I drop off my car, since they had to order the parts. I dropped off my car 2 days later and they finished the job before the day was over. I met Pete, who did the job himself. He was super nice and very reassuring. I trust his expertise. Alex was also very helpful and accommodating. The whole team deserves more than 5 stars, in my opinion. They have great customer service, honest-to-goodness dealings, lower pricing, and they're trustworthy. I recommend this place to everyone who needs their car serviced or repaired. I'll never go back to Firestone."
positive,"After getting a brake job this afternoon (thanks, Rusty!), I was reminded that I have been getting great service from Bob and his gang for over 17 years. This is a great shop for getting oil changes, tire rotations, mufflers, brakes, and numerous other basic services. The prices have always been fair, the information great, and the services excellent. I always recommend this Meineke as a place you can trust."
positive,"On a trip from So. Cal. to Vegas my car overheated.  AAA towed the car to Tonys.
The service was excellent- Had an estimate to us within 2 hours and car repaired within then next 4 hours!.  I needed a new radiator, hoses, fan and thermostat-- First thing to ever be repaired on my 2005 Aviator -  The cost was surprisingly reasonable!  It would have easily been 60% higher in California for the same repairs.  
I would highly recommend."
positive,"I had originally installed a bolt on cat back system on my truck and was pretty happy with the results. I later decided I wanted to go more aggressive (louder) and picked up a new muffler and y pipe. The y pipe I had purchased wasn't quite the right size so they swapped it with one they had no problem. In and out with the new muffler and y pipe in less than an hour. Service was top notch and I am extremely happy with my new setup. Price was outstanding to boot, I will definitely return with any further exhaust work. Highly recommend!"
positive,"I brought my 1987 Corvette into this shop after it had spent a few years in a body shop for a full restoration. I had diagnostic issues with a check engine light and Ken the mechanic confirmed the codes I found and fixed my car right the first time. I asked him to do a rear differential service on my car since it had been sitting for years at the previous shop and when I returned to pick up my car he said, ""someone at the bodyshop must have already done this service as the fluids are clean and look new"". He could have easily have just done the service and I would have never known, Now that's an honest mechanic. I have met the owner Sung and I must say both Ken and Sung are very knowledgeable. I will be back to this shop. They will be working on my 1966 Cadillac this weekend as they work on both modern and classic cars. I have added this shop to my conacts list!"
positive,When I brought my car in to get my flat tire repaired in my oil change they found an oil leak that was that happened when my car was built they fixed it but then when I drove it away the check engine light came on and they said it was either when I took it back to him the next day they said it was either the oxygen sensor or the catalytic converter so they ordered the oxygen sensor they put it in today the check engine light went away but my car is still making a noise so I'm going to take it back to him tomorrow but they were very nice to me today they brought me home and when my car was ready they called me and I just want to say that there was a problem with my car they they came in they pick me up to bring me back to my car so I do want to thank them for that and I will I know they will take good care of me and fix this problem I'm having with my car much thanks to Nationwide Buick GMC and Denise
positive,"I've lived in Las Vegas for 2 years now and the first time I got my oil changed here I went to Jiffy Lube. I thought it was all good but as soon as I left, my car started smoking and my check engine light came on. I went back to them and they wiped it off so it stopped smoking however my light never went off and my car started running weird. I was looking for a reliable place that actually cares about their customers but is also affordable. I found this place and it was great. The staff, especially Joe, was welcoming and friendly. They had a cool waiting room, And when I got my car back it didn't smoke or have a light on. (How it should be) Definitely going back to them for any work I need done in the future."
positive,"Incredibly happy I found this place.   Although getting your car repaired is never fun or convenient, Tracy definitely makes the process painless and worry-free.

I am always impressed with the quality of their work, their customer service, and their honest, reasonable pricing. 

I wouldn't (and don't) go anywhere else for auto body repairs."
positive,"I brought my new (to me) '07 Toyota 4Runner to Mike and Mark after it started shifting strangely.  Mike and Mark assuaged my fears of a completely blown transmission.  They also clarified some misunderstandings I had about my vehicle, as well as brought me into the garage to show me my car on the lift.  They showed me the cause of my problems and carefully explained the service that my vehicle did (and did not) need.  

I was given a ride home, and was called in the afternoon (as promised) when my car was ready for pickup.

I am so glad to have found a local, trustworthy mechanic for my car."
positive,"We've had so many bad experiences with auto shops, I never thought we'd find someone we could actually trust. The guys at Rebel actually changed our minds about this. They are awesome....great at what they do, competitive prices and HONEST. If you take your vehicle there and ask them for something and you don't need it they'll actually tell you instead of ripping you off. They changed the transmission in our Lincoln truck and let us know that it was probably still under warranty, which I didn't even think to check. We ended up getting everything covered by the transmission company since it was a defect and we were so thankful! They've also worked on our other car and they always do the best job. Told us our brakes were fine when we came to get them changed (most places would just change them to get the money). I'm so thankful we found them and will recommend them to everyone we know."
positive,I got a cat back exhaust system installed from performance muffler about 6 years back using all the parts they had in house. Never had any issues since. The did a great job and would recommend them to others
positive,This is the best place to get your car repaired in town. I have taken my car elsewhere and spent a lot of money and it was not repaired correctly. These guys are very honest and fair with their prices and they get the job done quickly and correctly. Very nice people to do business with. I highly recommend them
positive,"They rotate tires for free even if you don't buy your tires there. Yeah, that's definitely their sales pitch, but I will definitely go back to a Discount Tire in the future for my tire needs. 

I was in and out in 20 minutes and didn't pay a dime. So much win."
positive,"I recently moved to AZ from CA.  I noticed some transmission fluid leaking and needed to take my GMC truck to a trustworthy shop to get fixed.  I asked a co-worker of mine if he knew of anyone local and he recommended Good Works.  So I took my truck in and Elsie, the shop lady, was super nice.  They ended up putting my truck on a lift and had me come in to review.  Standing underneath my truck Glenn and the crew pointed out what was wrong and showed me exactly what was leaking and made suggestions to fix.  I thought that approach was so cool as usually your left in some waiting room taking some guys suggestion for repair without even seeing what the issues are. Needless to say they fixed my truck and stood by their work.  I've taken my wife's Yukon in for repairs as well.  They are not the cheapest place in town but they do a great job and stand by their work.  Without a doubt I have had the best experience for car repairs with Good Works Auto Repair!  Highly recommended!!"
positive,"I can't say enough good things about this shop. First, disclaimer, I was ASE certified *many* years ago, before most cars had computer controlled systems. So I like to think I know enough to not be deceived by auto shops.

I have frequented Marshall's Service Center for years, and been perfectly happy with them, except for one small issue. They are 10 miles from my house. So any lengthy service that requires dropping the vehicle off (they don't have shuttle service) can be a pain. So the only reason I tried Community was initially because they are close, and because ABC 15 news did a ""smart shopper"" segment on them so I thought, ""How bad could they be?""

I started off with a simple oil change, tire rotation, and ""could you please check some kind of fluid leak behind the left rear tire?"" I elected to hang out in the lobby, and within 15 minutes the tech came in and asked me to come look at the vehicle on the rack. He found my left rear shock was ""shot"" and leaking fluid. It was clear to me that was causing the stain on my garage floor, so I went ahead with replacement of that.

I had also mentioned an odd shifting problem with the auto transmission. They found my transmission pan gasket leaking which *might* be causing the transmission to slip due to low fluid levels. I opted to hold off on that for a few weeks and come back for a full transmission system flush and gasket replacement.

As the repair went on, I listened to a conversation with another customer in the lobby with Lorenzo, the service manager. The customer had been told by a Chevrolet dealership that his PCV valve was bad, which was causing a performance problem with his vehicle but that ""the valve and the valve cover for the head is one piece"" and must be replaced together, all told costing $700. Myself, and Lorenzo, thought that sounded suspicious so Lorenzo (free of charge) made some phone calls for the customer to find that the PCV valve was SEPARATE from the valve cover, and cost a mere $5 for the PCV valve. The customer could swap that out themselves rather than paying the tech to do it or let Community do it for a small charge.

All that said, it's clear to me that Community treats customer's well, and they don't try to pull a fast one and make you spend money you don't need to. Further, I've had a nagging ""clanking"" noise in the front end of my vehicle for 2 years that no one has been able to isolate. The tech at Community took my vehicle for a test drive after replacing shocks and changing the oil, and relayed that he heard the sound I had complained about. He took another look at the vehicle and said, ""Oh, it's your stabilizer, the bushing is worn and every time I drove over a bump in the road, it made that noise."" Now that said, the repair is 10+ hours which means about $1000 to fix, but the tech made it clear this isn't a safety issue, just an annoyance. Until, of course, it gets really worn and then could be a safety issue but I was just impressed after ONE drive of the vehicle, he knew what the problem was (and again, he SHOWED me).

I can't say enough about the integrity of this shop. I'll be coming back again with all of my vehicles. Not withstanding my love of Marshall's Service Center, these guys are only 5 miles from my house and they're awesome :)"
positive,"Anything exhaust related on my car, I come here to get it fixed. I been referred here to get my exhaust work done here. I came here a total of 4 times, 2 times to get my muffler fixed, ! time to get my exhaust manifold fixed, and 1 time to get a exhaust leak fixed. Every time they called to explain what needed fixed and gave me a price. Everything my car was fixed in a timely manner. I usual dealt with Mark who was friendly and did profession work. Prices do seem kind of high but that's my only complaint. I will continue to come here but hopefully something doesn't go wrong with my car in awhile."
positive,"I recently needed some work done on my 2004 Passat. I have been to this location a few times before for a assortment of repairs but over the past week they truly helped me. First my battery died and I took it to Volkswagen North Scottsdale and Tom Radtke was the Service representative that took care of me. I expressed my need to have my car asap and even though they were fully booked for that day Tom made sure to squeeze my car in and had it back to me in a matter of hours. Later that week my check engine light or MIL light came on, I made an appointment Monday morning to see Tom again for the new issue. He was extremely helpful and made sure to get back to me as soon as possible to keep me informed about what needed to be done on my car. I have received extremely consistent customer service at this location in the Service Department. I truly appreciated the high level of service I received from Tom, and while I hopefully won't be back too soon for more repairs I now have a trusted person and location I can go to! Thank you Tom Radtke!"
positive,"Bruce is amazing! He helped my Mom get her car repaired after a collision and we couldn't be happier with the results. It's like she has a new car! It handles better than it did before the accident and looks amazing. Even the interior was detailed! The insurance was going to total the car and that would have been a problem for my mom. Bruce stepped in. I don't know what he did if anything, but the insurance company decided it was worth fixing and now she has a ""like new"" car again. It was pretty fast turnaround too. I would give Bruce 10 stars if Yelp would let me! Thanks, Bruce, for taking such great care of my Mom and her car."
positive,"I took in my Toyota Tundra pickup because of a check engine light. There were two bad sensors causing issues. Avi the owner/mechanic took good care of my truck. He showed me both the old parts and the diagnostic reports which means a lot. I do my own routine maintenance and have done larger repairs in the past, so I know my way around an engine. I didn't feel ripped off once everything was done and I know my truck will be on the road for years to come. I would recommend Courtesy Auto Repair."
positive,"After my car being at Chevy dealer an entire day and they never even looked at it, I called here and then drove right over after talking to Liz. In 5 minutes they told me I did NOT have a transmission problem, unlike the dealer. It turned out I needed new spark plugs. I had brakes replaced and they found a few other minor things that needed fixing and got it all done in a few hours and at a reasonable price. Liz even got me a rental car for the day so I didn't have to miss anymore time from work.  I can't say enough good thing about this place!! I will be getting all my service and repairs done here from now on."
positive,Had a couple mufflers replace at Performance Muffler on my 1962 Chevy ll. Russ the owner is a knowledgeable and very good at what he does. The quality of the work is excellent I highly recommend using Performance Muffler. Thanks Russ keep up the hard work.
positive,"Honest employees did a great job.I was weary of going to an AAMCO. I have been to other AAMCOs and have had unbelievably bad experiences. Yet, this AAMCO had a coupon on their website for a transmission fluid flush for $60 bucks, nearly half off! The staff was very courteous and prompt. I called in the evening and they got me an appointment the next morning on a SAT! They were respectful, quick, and didn't feed me any bull about something wrong with my vehicle like every other shady mechanic in AZ. They did exactly what I paid AAMCO to do and they did it well. After the flush my transmission is running brand new and was an amazing deal to help further the lifetime of my transmission. These guys are honest and will make me a repeat customer for my future transmission needs! Thanks guys!"
positive,"I had originally gotten an oil chain at one of their competitors when I found out that my transmission was leaking, but the original place I got my oil change did not fix  transmission leaks. I have only lived in the area a couple years and didn't know where to go but was told to go to Good Works. They offered to look at my transmission free of charge. They took me back and showed me what was wrong and explained it in terms I understood since I don't know that much about vehicles. They told me it wasn't an issue now but will be in the future they said to come back every few months or so and will check it out. I plan to get all of my car needs repaired by Good Works from now on!"
positive,"While visiting family in AJ for Thanksgiving, I needed to find a shop to do an oil change on my 35-foot Class A motor-home.  I called to see if they could accommodate an RV of this size and if they could do the work that day, without an appointment.  They told me it would be no problem and quoted me right around $55.00.  I was in and out in right around an hour.  They did the routine inspection, lubed the chassis and added a quart of transmission fluid.  I had them use synthetic oil (about 4x the cost @ $5.00-6.00/qt)  My total bill was right around $80.00 +tax.  I can't complain!"
positive,Had to go here 3x to get what i wanted and they always worked out on the time I wanted. I was gonna go to the muffler shop near me and got quoted $139 on the same thing they did to me for 40$. So the 15 min drive is worth the low price they quote you and the quality of work they put into. Definitely the way to go in terms of muffler/exhaust problem/customization.
positive,"This was by far the best experience I have ever had with an auto shop. 

My girlfriend and I were traveling across the country from Boston to San Francisco, and Vegas was one of our stops on the trip. Everyone's biggest nightmare when driving cross country is having mechanical problems, and breaking down. We started to have acceleration problems and the check engine light was on, so we decided to get it looked at in Vegas.

I called early in the morning, when the shop opened, in order to make an appointment and make sure that I had enough time for the car to be fixed. When I called I was told that no appointment was needed and that I could just bring the car in... needless to say I was stunned and amazed.

When I brought it in Hamid took my keys, informed me that they had a great selection of coffee, sodas, and cookies that I could enjoy while I waited - I was pretty happy at this point. After a short time, my car was brought into the garaged and diagnosed. Not only did Hamid give me a diagnosis for what could potentially be wrong with my car, he also gave me a diagnosis of everything else that was wrong with my car, with great descriptions and prices!!!

I ended up getting a couple of things fixed, one the could have been related to my problem, and the other that was completed unrelated, a cracked coolant reservoir,  which Hamid suggested I should absolutely get fixed due to the fact that we were driving across the country and going through some hot areas. The entire experience was amazing!

I don't know how other auto shops are around Vegas, but there is no need to go anywhere else, Hamid and his mechanics are amazing and very friendly."
positive,"I first read through all Tony's Yelp reviews. Had to laugh at the couple 1 stars reviews.  Sounded like more a language barrier between the front desk and client. Oh well we can't make everyone happy all the time.

Here's my review in a nut shell.  My Mercedes check engine light came on and the engine stalled out on are way into Vegas.  We were lucky enough to be within 30 miles of town when it happen. The AAA tow company came out and referred us to Tony's.    After arriving Tony warned us that he was busy but would fit us in asap. He called the next day and explained We  needed a fuel pump. Gave us a verbal estimate which we authorized.  The car was fixed that same day with what I considered a very reasonable price.  The car runs great and I'm very happy with the results of his repairs. 

I'm very thankful for the referral the tow truck campany gave me to Tony's. I'm also in the auto repair business and have to admit that it was very hard for me to trust another shop to work on my Benz. But Tony and his crew did a great job. 

 So I write this review with great confidence that he treats all his old and new clients with the same respect and also prices his repair job correctly. 

Great job Tony

Thanks again 

Alan"
positive,"I just had my transmission rebuilt here. Jack is polite, has great follow-up, and went above and beyond for me.  I highly recommend this location and especially Jack."
positive,"My wife and I were visiting our son in Henderson and it was time for an oil change. Called Rebel and Joe worked me in. Infact, I think he did the service himself. Joe & Lee have also serviced our son's car transmission & brakes. Top shelf kind of guys. I feel they're shop can be trusted with any service needed."
positive,"I was Shopping around for a muffler and not really sure of what I was looking for but Russ helped me out! This company is knowledgeable, gave me a quote over the phone and that's exactly what I paid.  I even left my truck over night because of my schedule and when I picked it up there were no issues and the work and parts they installed are working great! My truck sounds awesome.  Thx!"
positive,"Great place for general car repairs, tires, etc. We have gotten excellent service through the years. We first started going to the West Side Car-X because my cousin works there but we have generally been impressed with everyone, the quality and speed of the work, etc. Our experience in other states (e.g. NY) has not been good with muffler shops, but we very much recommend this place."
positive,"I got check engine light on and had some rattling noise from the left exhaust. I found this shop online and decided to give it a try. I was somewhat suspicious about all the five-star reviews before I went there but guess what, they definitely deserve more than that! I explained to Bud, the owner, what happened to my car and the things I did. I can tell that he is a great listener and honest man. He said:"" I will tell you if I don't know but I will find it out."" I very much admire his honesty. In addition, he explained very thing to me in great detail and he shared his knowledge with me generously. Personally, I am a DIYer and have done several projects on my cars. I asked him about a few difficulties I have encountered, and he shared with me what he would do and what tools I will need. Bud is such a great mechanic! This is the shop I will bring my car in for as long as I own a MB."
positive,"This is my favorite place to get an oil change. Always fast, great prices with the Groupon deal, really not a better place in town for full synthetic oil changes. This time I had my transmission serviced and power steering fluid changed. Only added about 30 mins to my trip."
positive,Have car repaired here two times without any problem. I feel they are trustworthy honest reliable and friendly.
positive,"Not only have I purchased my Toyota from Erin Park, but I've had it serviced here for 9 of the 12years that I've owned my Toyota.  I'll try and focus on my recent trips for the sake of this review

Pros
- my Sales rep remembers me by name, and I haven't bought a car from her in 12 years
- they go above and beyond for their customers -- when a check engine light came on, they were able to see me the next day, and were clear upfront that they may not be able to get to it. (Meadowvale Toyota wanted me to come back a week later)
- most of the service advisors are very pro-active providing me with updates 

Cons
- service can be slow, if you're waiting or on a time crunch you need to communicate that to them when you book your appointment AND when you bring in your car"
positive,"Well... there goes my Christmas money. I took my car in because of a oil leak today. I walked in at 12pm left at 1:50pm. Fair time. I was expecting it to be a lot longer, but they had at least 5 auto technicians on the job and had at least 4 more cars before mine. I was surprised, well not really, that the customer service personnel at the counter were so nice on the phone and in person. The young man that helped me out today was very patient and nice. I was not helped by the woman, wish I got both of their names, was real cool too. Anyway it took that time and I was told that I was going to need to take off the oil pan to get to the leak and I also asked for an overall maintenance check out. Had that done.

  I was pissed tho. I was pissed at the work my previous auto shops sloppy job that did my transmission on my car and how it was coming back to haunt me with this oil leak problem. I had my transmission rebuild by someone else and when they had that done they sealed off my oil pan so hard that it had three layers of a gasket on it. I am guessing so in the future it wont ever drip. But it was sealed poorly and I am guessing that the liquid nails, Not what is supposed to be sealed with, was not allowed to cool off in time to have it permanently sealed so it was still leaking. 

  long story short I had to pay for another new one because this one was so tite the tech had to use a prie bar to take it off. Now that I am thinking about it... that way of taking it off could have damaged something else, but thats the risk I took and it came out fine. Anyway I did an oil change with a new filter, fixed an issue i did not know with my e break that was not looking all that properly, and that oil issue. Oh, also adjust and clean my breaks, air filter, remove & replace windshield washer fluid reservoir. It all came out to $696.20.

  I think the lesson I took away is to not look to cut corners on MAJOR repairs. Biggest payments were the maintenance on the Oil Pan Gasket and the windshield washer reservoir. It was all done at 5:30ish. Man I am still blown away by this mistake of taking it to these other guys... Thank goodness I found this place so close to my house. I will be coming here again later this year for more the final things to be done. Oh one more thing I had no idea I needed to do my smog check by next week!!! I didn't receive anything in the mail. Although I should keep track of it but still... (Car that was worked on was a 2001 Nissan Sentra GXE)"
positive,"I have to say, the General Manager, Jody has taken control of my problems. They had a new builder re-build my transmission completely. They took the time to communicate and assisted me with understanding every step. I am very happy with the outcome and my car is finally driving as it should! 
Thank you for taking the customer concern serious and doing the right thing!"
positive,Stopped by for a quick check engine light diagnosis. Quick and Efficient. Customer Service was great and stepped out with satisfaction. That's all I would care for.
positive,"So we rolled into Vegas at about 3pm on Thursday afternoon and my check engine light had been on since half way through the ride from San Diego.  We had to stop at the gas station down the street on Flamingo Rd. to wash up and change in a very gypsy like fashion.

Trying to keep it cool and on the safe side(and mainly on a budget) I decided it was best to have my SUV diagnosed, did a google search and I came across R&R Auto on Ogden St.
When we rolled up I was amazed to see that these guys had a huge shop with over six ports and all of them were full, which lead me to believe they have their shit together....sure nuff, in no time I told the lady at the counter what the problem was and I hadn't waited more than 5 minutes when one of the Tech's came out with a high-end scanner that was able to tell me exactly why my check engine light was on.

In the meanwhile my wife and 4 yo daugter were able to cool off inside of the office with soda and water while they watched TV on the couch.

Apparently a vacuum plug had fallen off and my manifold needed some cleaning, needless to say these guys took care of it within the hour and also performed a leak test on my vacuum system. Their prices are waaaay below dealer cost and I was more than happy to pay for their expedient service, it's like they were conscious that were tourists and didn't want to spend our vacation time in a shop

The day before we left we stopped to get an oil change and they even gave us a lift to the old strip and picked us up so we wouldn't have to wait around while our car was serviced.  Keep up the good work guys!!!  Highly recommend it.

Pros:
Clean shop
Fast service
Honest family owned business.

Cons:

positive,"I went to get my tire fixed, they got me in & out which was perfect!!  I needed my car looked at because it was bouncing all over the place!  So, I bought my car in they took it for a spin  and said I,  My 2008 Blue mustang needed struts & shocks.  So I bought my car in the next day to have my car repaired - after they got through working on  my car, low & behold, My ""Pearl Blue"" mustang was "" purring"" down the highway once again!!  Evidently!  They know what thier doing & know how to work on my particular car and it truly shows.  My mustang shines inside & out!!  You know why,  because the LOVE shows through thier repair work on your car and the customer service is FANTASTIC!!!  THANKS DIMAGGIOS again!!"
positive,"So here I am AGAIN.

For the third time too. This time it was just a ""get rid of the credit union"" mission. I financed my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu through America First Credit Union based in Utah. So everything was fine until they started sending me requests for proof of insurance on my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu LTZ that I had purchased from AutoNation Buick GMC West Sahara. As soon as I got the windows tinted on my Malibu, I picked it up and drove it home and called my insurance agent with State Farm. I sent them the forms that America First Credit Union had sent me. They wanted to named lien holder of the Malibu so if it was wrecked, they got the loan paid off from my insurance company. No problem with that. They also wanted proof of coverage on my Malibu from the first day I bought it, which was March 16th, and according to my insurance agent with State Farm, I had a 15 day grace period to add the Malibu to my policy with my Lexus at the time being full coverage. So I did this as soon as I possibly could. I got this same request from America First Credit Union twice, and twice I sent the forms to my insurance agent through fax. Then America First Credit Union hit me with a $3400 insurance policy against my 2011 Malibu, because the information my insurance agent was not to ""their liking"". So now they really upset me, so I decided on either refinancing the Malibu or possibly getting another car because I was ""DONE"" with America First Credit Union. They also bumped my payments up from $346 a month to $402 a month, but didn't extend my loan term.

So I went to AutoNation Buick GMC West Sahara where I bought the Malibu in the first place. I asked for my salesman Devon Harger to be there when I got there at 8am. He's the only person I will do business with besides Denzell Williams because these two men have earned my trust completely. So I drove two 2015 Chevrolet Impalas that were fully loaded. One was an LTZ, the other was a 2LT, but all in all, nice cars. I was hoping to break even on the trade by putting down a little money, and by cancelling the extended warranties and other add ons I got for the Malibu. I wasn't expecting to have to go through another car purchase to dump America First Credit Union. So after doing a ""trade appraisal"" I knew I had negative equity and I realized that doing a refinance on my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu wasn't feasible. Banks won't finance a car for more than what it's worth when attempting to do a refinance. So this led me to the last two options: I could keep my Malibu which I loved and still love, or I could look at other vehicles that were 20% off including Buick Regal, and GMC Acadia. I chose to drive a 2016 Buick Regal, and decided to run the numbers on this particular car to see where I would be at payment wise. I was now already paying $402 a month for my Malibu thanks to America First Credit Union, and the payments on a 2016 Regal were just $54 more a month. Why so high? We were able to wipe out all of the negative equity by cancelling everything we could with the 2011 Malibu, we used the 20% off on the Buick Regal to take care of the rest of it along with 1k from me, which under the circumstances was not too much to ask. I'm even getting a free window tint on this Regal. 

Features that I will miss from my Malibu:
Bose Audio system, Dark Red paint job, Bigger than the Regal, and the V6 3.6 engine (very sporty performance for a mid size sedan). 
How ever, I got a few bonus's from buying the Regal:
V4 Turbo charged engine which acts like a V6 but won't eat much gas, a modern built in Navigation System with Pandora and Apple Car Play built in, Cream Colored White paint job, and a nice Buick Interior. Both vehicles had remote start, ambient lighting, window tints, dual exhaust, and nice 18 alloy wheels. 

So I thought to myself, it's a trade off on a few things, and a gain on a few things. What's more important to me right now? Doing business in my vehicles for Real Estate, and banking with a trusted credit union out here in Nevada, keeping the money local to our economy. And, The Buick Regal's engine and transmission are built here in the United States of America. Its final point of assembly is in Canada though, but considering that Canada is a huge trading partner of the United States, I can live with it. The vital componants of the car are made here at least. So overall, I am happy with the car, and I'm sure in time I will come to love it, but again, I'm happy with the performance of Devon Harger, Doug (the finance guy in the office) who didn't pressure me into anything,  and Steve (Finance Guy behind the computer screen) because I was given a much fairer deal here on my trade and on the purchase of the 2016 Regal than I would have been given at Fairway Chevrolet on the purchase on a 2016 Chevrolet Impala LTZ or 2LT (which they didn't have any 2Lts). To top it off, again thanks to everyone at AutoNation Buick GMC West Sahara! I won't go anywhere else to buy a car!"
positive,"I've rented a bay there whenever one of my cars needed work. Prior to my first rental, I had to watch a video and sign a release. they drove my car in and put it up on the lift. Understand, this establishment only rents you a lift and tools. It's not meant to be an ordinary mechanic's  garage.

As the owner of a couple of foreign cars, including a diesel Mercedes, it's hard to find places that won't take you for an arm-and-a-leg just to change the oil. I bring my own oil, filters and tools. I'm usually in-and-out in an hour. 

There are entire tool chests for rent (with air tools) for an additional $10/hr. They can order whatever parts you need, from oil and filters all the way to crate motors/transmissions. There is access to online Mitchell Manuals if you need a reference materials. I just wish they had a parts cleaner. 

If you get in over your head (I have), ask for Rick. He will help you or take over the job for a reasonable price. I've seen him working on Ferraris, Porsches and Mercedes. 

There has been some confusion. I've seen other ""professional"" mechanics in there. Remember, they rent a bay just like you. I've seen some pretty cheesy activity by some of these guys (Hello, Don). If Rick works on your car (at your request) you will get a U-Fix-It receipt. He stands behind his work. He did on one of my cars."
positive,"These guys are great. I was having some problems with my Audi A4 (oil pressure, and check engine light on) and they took a look at my car right away. Eventually they had determined that I needed a new oil pump and called me with an estimate. When I told them I was going to check with the Audi dealership to see if my car was still under warranty to take care of the repairs (which it was), they gave me no trouble at all and accommodated my needs by allowing me to pick up my vehicle after hours to drive it to the dealership. By the time they had found out what was wrong, they had spent two hours on it for which I was charged roughly $160 ($79/hour for labor).
Not only that, Rock went out of his way to unlock my girlfriend's running car when she accidentally locked herself out right outside their shop. Cannot give these guys enough credit! Very reliable, understanding, and friendly service. 
Will be back without a doubt!"
positive,"I started having trouble with my Pontiac Grand Prix about fifty miles south of flagstaff, and when I finally got it down to Tempe we took it right over to Good Works. Deeanna recalled off the top of her head how much a check engine light inspection would be and made me feel very welcome. As it was late in the day, I received my inspection link early the next morning and realized there was A LOT wrong with my high mileage baby. The breakdown of the bill was SO HELPFUL and helped us pinpoint how much it was going to cost to get it back home to Farmington, New Mexico to get to our family mechanic. They covered the minor repair to clear the limp mode on the car in the inspection charge. Brian was wonderful over the phone and super helpful. Going to pick up my baby in a couple hours to get her home."
positive,"I needed my car repaired quickly and at a fair price. I got exactly that with Mike and his guys. Good, quick mechanics that won't upsell you or try to do unnecessary repairs. Mike explained to me exactly what the issue was and even showed me the old part after it was replaced. You get honest, reliable service at Car Guyz. I will be bringing my car back whenever I need service!"
positive,"Need a good auto repair place, this is it. 

I have been using Terry's for over 8 years. I was introduced to Terry's Auto by a friend.  Since that time, I have used this place exclusively for my cars. 

It is very tough to find an auto mechanic that you can trust.  With Terry's, I drop my car off, tell them what I need and walk out. I come back, usually by the end of the day, and he is done.  Fair price without a worry. 

Have been taking my wifes 1997 Chrysler there for years. Have had new transmission, new sets of tires, and multiple other basic maintenance.  A vehicle that probably would not have lasted more than 100k miles is still running well at 150k plus miles. 

Terry has even been kind enough to work with me on payments when I had transmission installed. 

Can't promise he will do the same with you, but then, I have been going to him for 8 years. 

Need a good mechanic, look no further..."
positive,"Thank you Tobias for you recent service on my HHR. Within a week you got my transmission replaced!! I am back on the road. Big Kudos to Chuck over at the Cave Creek location. 

To all of my Yelp friends, if you need a referral for a great automotive repair shop and servicing center go to Tobias Automotive Specialists"
positive,"Was referred to Performance Muffler by Cars Complete Auto Care, performance Muffler did a great job for a very reasonable price. Instead of ""selling me"" a new muffler, they quickly repaired the one I had. Great to find an honest repair shop."
positive,"These guys are able to diagnose the check engine lights and give you solutions to the problems your car may have.  They have always had the parts I needed and the staff has been courteous and knowledgeable regarding the issues I have had. 

They offer a lot of free services from battery installations, testing alternators to even windshield wiper installations.

They just helped me fix my dreaded check engine light at a fraction of the costs of other places."
positive,"I drove in from California and out of nowhere my car started to act funny and my check engine light came on. I called several places and I just kept getting astronomical quotes or people saying it will take a few days to get it fixed. Not only was Marco able to see me right away, he was very helpful and made me feel at ease. This hands down was the most pleasant experience I've had at an auto repair shop. Thank you so much!"
positive,"I've been getting my 'ole changed here for 'bout 14 years now.  Yes, I meant to say ""'ole"" and not ""oil"".

It costs about $35 for the 'ole change, but if you're a repeat customer, you will receive a $3.00 coupon, bringing the total, along with the tax that we owe our blessed governor to $33.

It may seem like a pricey 'ole change, but they don't just change your 'ole.  They also check and adjust your tire pressure, vacuum your floorboard, top off your windshield washer fluid, brake fluid and power steering fluid (if applicable), inspect your air filter, and lubricate your axles (if applicable).  I buy my own air filters at Wal-Mart for like $8.00.  They offer other services like automatic transmission fluid replacement with T-Tech.

While you're waiting for you 'ole change, you get to listen to music, breathe some exhaust-filled air, and read Popular Mechanics.  What fun!  Two of the mechanics have been working here for quite some time and they are friendly and excellent at what they do."
positive,"Hamid the owner really caters to his customers. I first walked in and pleasantly surprised to find that it was comparable to the Lexus dealership waiting room, on a smaller scale. The waiting area is comfortable with a variety of beverages and even a small freezer for ice cream that is provided to the customers. The bathrooms and lobby was very clean and comfortable. For service, I only got an oil change but they were fast, VERY reasonable, and professional. I have gone to 4 other automotive shops for a quote on my transmission and was told that it would cost anywhere from $3400-$4000. Hamid gave me a quote of $2800. I will definately come back and recommend that anyone looking  for automotive work, come here!!"
positive,"Not only is this my go-to place for muffler work, I have also had my brakes done here, as well as a tire rod. I went to the old Chevy dealer in N. Olmsted and they told me I needed a whole new exhaust ($700), went here and they replaced my muffler for $50. Since then I have been a loyal customer, recommending all I can to them to save money.

Be there before they open in the AM. so your car will be first to get worked on. You should have your car back in a few hours. By far, the most affordable (down right cheap) muffler work in the city. And, NO ladies, this place will tell you the truth about what is wrong with your car (if your completely clueless, like me). Great job All Star!"
positive,"I'm not one to do reviews on yelp but I had to for this shop.  WOW!! Is all I have to say about John Jay Automotive.  I have a 2000 Honda Civic Si, it HAD a check engine light on for running rich and a couple other issues that stemmed from that.  I took my vehicle to two different shops that only work on Honda and Acura vehicles.  They couldn't figure out the issue after having my vehicle for 3-4 days at each shop, I was very lost on what to do, I felt I was in trouble. Upon further digging for shops and reading reviews I found John Jay Automotive.  As soon as I walked into John Jay Automotive I was greeted by the son of Jay.  Not only was he professional but Jay immediately walked out and started talking to me about my vehicle.  Not only did I feel at ease but I was talked to like a human and not just a dollar sign.  Upon leaving my vehicle I was always updated daily regarding repairs and what they found and what the cause was and how they were going to repair it.  John Jay Automotive is like no other repair shop I've ever been too.  They went above and beyond my expectations and even did little extra things that no other shop would have done.  Once my vehicle was finished I was called and given my pricing for repairs completed and I was so surprised and relieved, not only did they make the repairs and find the issues but no more check engine light.  John Jay Automotive is an HONEST, RELIABLE, and FAIRLY priced repair shop that I couldn't be more happy with.  They don't try to overcharge you or charge your for things you don't need.  I will from now on take ALL my vehicles back here and I will be referring as many people as I can here, and I highly recommend them to anyone reading this."
positive,"Bell Union is the most honest mechanical shop I have ever been too. I took my truck to 2 other places, both gave me a different estimate and service recommendation for fixing my transmission. I took it to Sung and Ken and they walked me through every part, fluid and piece so I could understand it. It turns out that it didn't even need any servicing yet! They saved me from throwing away hundreds of dollars! If you want the truth, go check these guys out!"
positive,"Amazing service by Jimmy and Sean G. Super friendly and fast service.
The price was so much lower compared to other places and the job was done better than it would have been at a dealership. 
I heavily recommend coming here for any maintenance, service or transmission issues. 
Their lounge is also really comfy compared to most places. Normally I leave to go to a Starbucks but I was given coffee and comfy seat. 
If you go anywhere else, you're missing out."
positive,"My check engine light was on so I took my car to them in order to pass smog. They took care of the problem, and helped me pass within a couple days. Very knowledgeable,  very informative and helpful. Both Joe and Lee always give me accurate info, price and time estimates. A week later my fuel injection went out so I had it towed to them. Luckily nothing else was damaged so I had them do a tune up while it was there. Car is running great and I highly recommend them.  I will keep coming back."
positive,"I called WW Williams, an authorized Allison Dealer, in Phoenix about a delay shift problem on my Allison transmission installed in my Tiffin Phaeton motorhome from Pahrump, NV. Jim, the Service Manager, invited me to bring it in for a diagnostic check. Upon arrival several days later after completing my stay in Pahrump, Javier Carrara was assigned as my Service Advisor. A work order was written up for my specific problem. I mentioned to Javier that we live in our motorhome full time and I was assured that a service tech would be assigned asap. We left to have lunch somewhere close by. A few hours later, Javier contacted me to inform me that a software update was applied to the TCM  (transmission control module) and that the service tech had driven it for about 7 miles and could not duplicate my problem. Since it was already in the shop, I requested a fluid and filter change, which was eventually performed. I was contacted by the evening shift service advisor, Jason, who indicated that our coach was ready. I requested a test drive with a service tech (Josh) to ensure the delay shift problem was resolved. Sure enough, shifted like butter now!! All it required was that software update to fix my shifting problem. Josh took the time during my test drive to explain the functions of the transmission and the shifting process which was a great help in understanding it from an owner's perspective.

This is a rather lengthy review but, to net it out, WW Williams resolved my shifting problem in a day allowing me to take possession of my home and continue my journey without requiring an over night stay in a hotel!! My thanks to all of the staff at WW Williams for the care, expertise and professionalism displayed and exhibited during my maintenance and repair procedures.

I would certainly not hesitate to have future work required on my Allison performed at WW Williams and would highly recommend them to others needing Allison transmission repair or maintenance."
positive,"I came to Findlay's service department after being treated horribly at Henderson Chevy. My 2010 Malibu had been having issues since I bought it September 16, 2014.  This past weekend was horrible and I decided I needed to have another dealership look at her. I took her in on 1/7/2015 Wayne was my service adviser. He was amazing!!!!! He listened to me and actually seemed like he cared and really wanted to get my car fixed. I have had an issue with my car running rough that Henderson Chevy made me feel like I was crazy, but Wayne started my car and said ""Your car has a rough idle"". All I could think was I knew I wasn't crazy! Well a really long story short my transmission needs to be flushed because the fluid in there is overheating and dirty. I'm not thrilled I have to pay for a service Henderson Chevrolet should of done months ago, but i am happy that my car will be better. I will continue to come to Findlay Chevy for all my car service needs.  Thank you so much!!!!"
positive,"Yelp did not disappoint. This was 1 of 3 my wife narrowed down for a transmission service & general diagnostics. First stop was really expensive & quoted a 3 hour wait. My wife directed me to Hamid & team at Busy Buggy. Not only was the transmission service less expensive than CARS on Valley View, it was also completed in 1 hour. Hamid also made recommendations to repair in the future without pressure & upselling. Other mechanics have used fear tactics if the upsell is rejected & remark ""be careful out there,"" with an obviously sarcastic tone. Not the experience here. Great complementary Keurig coffee, ice cream and cookies...as far as auto shops go, who else does that in Vegas? Thanks Busy Buggy for your great service when your competitors were only concerned about closing up shop to start their New Years Eve parties. Hat's off to you!"
positive,"I have been to this shop multiple times and have always received great service from Joe and his team. This shop was highly recommended to me and I would highly recommend this shop to anyone in need of  exhaust work or install. They offer quality work and great pricing. 

My fourth time using the shop I was in a pinch and needed work done to my Audi....ASAP. Although they were slammed, Joe made me feel like a priority and got the work done on his own time. My mechanic at Audi came with me to the shop and was blown away by the quality of work that Joe did on my car. 

****Regarding the review by Ken F, I too am a minority and have never once felt this way about Joe or anyone on his team. I am sorry that you felt this way about your experience. I know that this was a misunderstanding and  hope that you will give these guys another shot. I know that your perception is your reality, but in this case your perception of this shop is wrong and they deserve another chance. Thanks for listening.**** 

Thanks again Joe. I will continue to refer people to you and you are the only muffler shop I will use."
positive,"Great honest work. I had another shop do transmission work, and I had nothing but troubles afterwards. I found el jesse's shop online and brought my Jeep in. They repaired it at a good price, and when something else sprang up after the initial repair they fixed it at only the cost of parts. I'll definitely return if I need any more transmission work."
positive,"This is my favorite car service shop on the entire planet! Every time I've ever brought in a vehicle I feel I've been treated fairly and squarely by first-rate professionals, who bend over backwards to take care of you; giving you the straight scoop on your vehicle; and they don't try to sell you anything that isn't truly ready to be replaced. Let's face it, taking a vehicle in for service isn't typically anyone's idea of a barrel of fun.  

And, who hasn't at some point in their lives had a vehicle in for something simple, such as an oil change, only to get handed an estimate of $1,759 (or a lot more) for supposed repairs your vehicle may not truly need? Not to mention that if you object to any of the estimate, particularly the most farfetched part of it, you may be told something to the effect that your vehicle ""could blow up,"" or ""the wheels will fall off, "" or ""you could be left stranded on the freeway,"" etc. If you're like me, you've been told this sort of thing many, many times. 

That doesn't ever happen at Kelly Clark, as they don't suggest replacing something unless you actually need the repair. In my mind, their integrity is as immaculate as the squeaky-clean waiting room. Customers just want honesty, and you'll get it at Kelly Clark. And they also do a better job of explaining exactly what is going on with your car than any place I have ever had a vehicle in for service. 

One if my favorite experiences here was when I brought a car brought a car in here, extemporaneously, that I was thinking of buying and asked them to do a complete inspection of the vehicle (as the owner had no documented maintenance records); and I was a little leery of taking a stranger's word for how well the car had been maintained.  Naturally, the owner of the vehicle was not too thrilled we were there (since the car was pristine in his mind), but he agreed to have the inspection as a condition of selling the car.

Fortunately, as I anticipated, Kelly Clark immediately jumped to attention and whipped the car in and out in a very timely fashion, replete with an assessment (either ""pass"" or ""fail"" for everything they checked).  And the final price ($57) was not only extremely reasonable, but it was also below the quote!  

I ended buying the car, with peace of mind, thanks to Kelly Clark and their excellent service.

UPDATE: 18 months - and 29k miles later - this car has not had a single repair, other than regular maintenance which was recommended by Kelly Clark at the time of the inspection (and corroborated by other facilities that subsequently arrived at the same conclusion): flushing the transmission fluid, brake pads, and flushing the power steering fluid. Kelly Clark was spot on!

UPDATE 2: 26 months - and 48k miles later - this car has only had one repair: a stuck lug nut. Meaning, that Kelly Clark's recommendation to buy the car turned out to be right on the money! Thank you, Kelly Clark, you're the best!"
positive,"My husband and I had used another repair facility adjacent to.AAA, for 15 years, for all our car care needs. After increasing labor charges and too many mistakes we decided to try AAA. We have never regretted the switch! We just had major (over $7800) work done on a 2000 vehicle and all-encompassing services were nothing short of stellar! David B. advised us along the way of every issue, kept us up to date on the work, worked within our budget and came in before the promise date. When your car is like your child you need to have total trust and faith in the people taking care of her. We do with this garage. From the service advisors to mechanics to courtesy drivers, this AAA garage exemplifies what any repair shop should be-a place of excellence.  Oh, and by the way... I had taken my car to (sounds like Spank Mo) to check my transmission. They of all people should know this part of the car, right? Wrong! They told me I needed a total rebuild to the tune of over $3800. AAA found it was only the speed sensors which was picked up by good old-fashioned computer codes.  $500.00 of the bill above was for this repair. Transmission is good as gold.
After the work,  David reviewed all warranties, when to come back for rechecks etc and it was extensively road-tested before it was returned to me. She drives fabulously!
The garage is clean, waiting area spacious, is near Starbucks and some local eateries, they have very friendly shuttle service, and there is a discount on labor costs for AAA members. 
Thanks to this garage I have my baby back and I have a trusted garage I can rely on without any BS. Love you, David!!"
positive,"Good, reliable, trustworthy, and cheap mechanics are hard to find. Heck, finding a mechanic that just fits one of the aforementioned categories is hard to find! 

Well, hidden away on Scranton Road on the western edge of Tremont, there's a little shop that fits within all of the categories in spades.

My wife has a 2003 Acura. Our check engine light went on, so we headed off to AutoZone to have them scan the codes and see what was up. Based on what was written in the owner's manual, we thought it may have been the transmission. I was afraid that the transmission needed to be replaced (ouch!) but since it had just been replaced in 2009, there was no way that was what was wrong. AutoZone said the spark plugs just needed to be replaced (whew!), and when we asked for a good local mechanic, they recommended Tu Casa. 

I didn't know what to expect, but when they checked out our car and told us that we could save money if we went and picked up the parts ourselves, I was sold. Many places will jack up the prices on parts to make a profit, and for them to suggest that we could save money by buying our own parts was a great sign of honesty in my opinion. A return trip to AutoZone saved us some cash, and an hour or so later, we had new plugs. They discovered that an ignition coil needed to be replaced too, so we told them we'd be back. When we asked for a labor quote on that, he told us that there'd be no charge since it only takes 5 minutes to replace, and it did.

I'm beyond pleased with our experience here--the labor prices were reasonable, the service was fast, and best of all, I don't feel ripped off. I'm never excited about having to visit a mechanic, but at least I know that the next time I need car repair done, I'll be taking my car to a good place and I won't be getting fleeced."
positive,"Unbelievably well run shop. They take SUCH great care of their customers. They get me in quickly, and out quickly and always leave me with excellent work and a CLEAN car when I drive out. 

I never stick around while they are servicing my car because I need to get back to work; but they make it hard to leave. There is abundant GOOD food, coffee, beverages, comfortable seating, televisions, an enclosed play area for children with great games and movies.

Who wants to waste time getting their car repaired? pretty much no one, but Earnhardt takes the sting out of the time investment with the great atmosphere and top notch customer service.
Thanks, Norm!!! You did it again!"
positive,Shawn in the service department was extremely helpful! I had a very weird issue with my Murano on a recent road trip and found out I need a new transmission :/ ! Nissan replaced it and gave me a rental car for a couple days! Happy with my experience there!
positive,A repair shop to trust and what could be better than that.  I took my car in with a difficult to determine problem.  My dealer told me it was a transmission fix for more than $1900.  Buddys was recommended by a friend.  They were honest and fair with a quick computer diagnosis and I was out the door for 100 bucks and extremely relieved that I found a trustworthy repair shop.
positive,"I had a check engine light come on, I have to tell you from the time I got someone on the phone I felt a relief EACH AND EVERY EMPLOYEE WAS JUST WONDERFUL. I will NEVER visit or recommend any other shop than this one. You guys rock!"
positive,My check engine light had come in on my car. Firestone said it was going to cost about $300 to do a complete diagnostic on it.  A friend told me about Ron's.  Got it checked and the problem fixed for less than what the diagnostic would have cost me at Firestone.  Great service.
positive,"Great customer service...Thought my tailpipe/muffler was bent because it was off the hanger due to backing into a rock. Took it in an the manager/worker put it on the lift, put the tailpipe back on the hanger and it wasn't bent as bad as I thought....Manager didn't charge me a dime. Next time I need work done, that's the place to go. Thanks"
positive,"Fantastic work done on my Honda Civic. I went in for a transmission fluid change, they took care of me fast and paid a super reasonable price. Highly recommended."
positive,"I have been there twice. The first time,  I got my car repaired after seating in my garage for almost 5 years. Everything was rightly done to my car, and prices were fair and very reasonable -for having original parts being installed to my car. The second time, I went to do minor interior repairs, and again, I found that prices for parts and labor were very reasonable for a Volkswagen dealership. I have to note too that I received knowledgeable and professional service from Tom Radtke, that I found their facilities very comfortable while I waited, and that I received my car in the time promised, and paid very close to the original quote agreed upon. Remember, this car was almost abandoned for five years, so, few things came up on the road to have it back to drivable conditions once again."
positive,"Often, it's as though most service relationships are adversarial...you vs them, as though there must be a winner and a loser.  It's uncommon to come across a business that treats you fairly and genuinely cares about your experience throughout the business interaction.  What is even more exceptional is finding a business that is able to leave an impression on you not just once, but one that consistently exceeds your expectations.  We discovered Stamps when my wife's car was in need of tires.  Our first experience brought us back, and every experience since has reaffirmed my opinion that Tim and his team are truly a rare find in the service industry.  
    Most recently, I brought my F250 in for servicing.  Of course, it was a weekday morning, trying to get kids to school before heading to work, and the truck won't start.  Based on the input of a roadside assistance team, I was expecting to walk out with two new batteries and at least one, if not two alternators (dual alternator vehicle), and a hefty unexpected bill.  Once the roadside assistance team got me running, I immediately called Tim and explained the situation.  Tim, understanding my need to find a solution before it was time to pick up kids, worked with his schedule and told me that if I came right in, he'd have me ready by that afternoon.  When I dropped off the truck, Tim had me in and out, he even drove me back to the house so that I could make arrangements to get to work as quickly as possible.  Around lunch Tim called me to let me know that he had checked the entire system (batteries, alternators, starter, wiring, etc) and the good news was that everything checked out except the batteries.  Regarding the batteries, I asked his opinion on several brands I'd researched, including some of the top-tier batteries on the market.  Tim had every opportunity to up-sell me but that's not how Stamps does business.  Instead, he considered my typical vehicle use, and recommended a set of batteries that should last me much longer without breaking the bank.  When I picked up the truck that afternoon, Tim was again there to meet me.  He explained exactly how they tested the system, what they found, and asked if I had questions....what you typically expect from a good service provider.  Tim then told me to check-in with him and let him know if I saw anything out of the ordinary.  He specifically told me what conditions to be aware of that might be indicative of another issue and reiterated to call him if there were any other difficulties.  This is what, in my opinion, makes Stamps a great service provider.  
   As I was getting ready to leave, Tim understood that this was an unanticipated expense and let me know that he was going to help me out on the final invoice.  He applied a generous discount and wished me a Happy Thanksgiving.  I walked out feeling as though I had someone looking out for my interests and I hope the Stamps team takes pride in knowing that they have absolutely earned my loyalty...a win-win situation, which should be the goal of any service provider."
positive,"I called Dan with a question concerning my 1970 C6 transmission. He took the time to research online and gave me my answer, knowing that my project is in Idaho."
positive,"I reached out to Joe a month before I wanted my exhaust put on. He was helpful, made some suggestions, then made the appointment. When the day came to get the work done, it was done prompt and the quality was great. Joe made sure that I was happy with everything prior to my leaving town. 

I will go to the shop should I need anything with my muffler in the future."
positive,"This review is for the service department. I brought my car here yesterday to have some warranty work done on my transmission. I called ahead for an appointment and Dave Burkhardt was able to set me up for that afternoon to assess the work that needed to be done. Dave explained that the actual repairs could take a few days, which I was prepared for. 

When I arrived for my appointment, Dave greeted me and checked me in quickly. I only had to wait 30 minutes for them to assess the issue and give me an update which I thought was fantastic! Parts had to be ordered. Dave explained it could take a week to arrive due to demand. I asked if it was ok to drive and Dave set my mind at ease and explained that I couldn't hurt it by driving which was a relief. 

Overall I had a very pleasant experience."
positive,"When I first moved to AZ from MN I had a check engine light on my VW Jetta.  Finding out I would fail my emissions test with that might on I took it to Tech 1 Auto.  In MN, I had taken it to two different car repair shops as well as 2 VW dealerships--no one could figure it out!  Tech 1 Auto fixed it! Great customer service! 

Had a bad battery recently, so I took it back to Tech 1 Auto.  Another very good experience.  Fred is a great guy, always feel I can trust this place!"
positive,These guys know exhausts. I needed to get my car modified with straight pipes and get the resonators cut. Performance muffler did it no problem. It was quick. In and out in like 20 mins. I actually called around to get some price quotes and this shop has the cheapest one. First time to get my car serviced here and they left a good impression no doubt. Highly recommended.
positive,"Let me start by saying that I grew up with a father who was a mechanic, and now that he is retired I have had to find other mechanics for my car needs.  I was getting an oil change and the young man asked me if I knew why my engine light was on, and I said that it was my transmission and I was scheduled to take her in to Aamco the following day.....he said nooooooo, don't take your car there unless you want to pay an arm & leg!  He referred me to All-Pro Transmission where he had his transmission worked recently and loved the work he had done and the customer service.  I called All-Pro and this very friendly man named Jim answered....I let him know my situation and he put me at ease by telling me that he wouldn't charge me a penny to look into the issue and I was surprised since Aamco was gong to charge me over $400 just to look into the transmission.  I got a rebuilt transmission within 4 days and I can't express the communication from Jim the owner was the best I've ever had from any company.  He called me every day to let me know how things were going and I didn't even have to call them once!  I truly believe that this company is like a hidden treasure.....some of the best places are hard to find, but when you find them...you want to share the news with everyone!"
positive,"Earns five stars because, 1) speed: they rebuilt my dead transmission in less than 24 hours, 2) honesty: saved me $900 by checking the TCM (Transmission Control Module) and noticing it was still in good condition before replacing it and 3) reliability; giving their work a two year, 24,000 mile warranty and 4) more honesty: letting me know up front what their estimate included.  The work is done in-house by a tight knit crew of experts.  Go here!"
positive,I called Shane Whitted and told him I had a potential seal leak in either transmission or axle.  He said bring it in to check and they found it was an axle seal leak that Shane said was covered under warranty. We found a time I could come back for service and he arranged a loaner car while my car was fixed.  Great service and having the loaner car was key to great satisfaction while my car was repaired. Thanks Shane and the Findlay team.
positive,"My car broke done at state line and I had to have it towed to Tony's. I couldn't have asked for a better place to have my car repaired. Tony and his staff, especially Jennifer, were courteous, efficient and quickly repaired my car. Their customer service was excellent, they called me to tell me what was wrong and 3 hours later the car was ready. The cost for repair was very reasonable.My car drives better than ever. I would highly recommend Tony's to anyone in need of repairs. Thank you Tony and staff, Chris"
positive,Just had some work done for my transmission which went defective after so many complaints to the dealer about it. The car was slamming a lot and turned out the transmission was bad. Worked with Brian and Trinity from Phoenix Bimmer and was able to get a new one on my extended warranty. I gotta say I love these ppl they are very professional and communicated with me every step of the way. Brian did a great job and my car feels like new again. No more slamming. Forget the dealership I'm glad I found these guys.
positive,Came in to do a simple muffler delete on my Mercedes. Quality welding and they price reasonably for the job. Highly recommend them!
positive,"I had a phenomenal experience with E & N Auto and Accessories! I took my van to Nathan, told him the symptoms, and he started right away with determining the problem and viable solutions. I felt valued as a customer knowing that my input was considered in determining the problem. Additionally, I appreciated being informed of every step in the process in a timely manner. I had my vehicle towed in on Thursday, and the work was completed by Friday. Not only was the work and customer service high-quality, Nathan exceeded my expectations by vacuuming my van and addressing an issue with my check engine light. If you want reasonable labor and parts with a company you can trust, put your faith-and vehicle-in the hands of E & N. They will not steer you wrong."
positive,"Recently had my older vehicle into the Wilson-Niblett repair centre for an oil change and diagnosis of some transmission noise. I was able to drop in with no appointment and they found a space for me right away. Debbie Oliver greeted me promptly and listened to my concerns and gave me a solid timeline. The oil change was done on schedule and she ensured very discount available was applied. When the diagnosis became more complicated, she insured I had a loaner car so I could continue with my day. Due poor weather conditions the technicians could not properly diagnose the problem as a test drive was needed and the slippery conditions would hide possible problems. Rather than proceed with unnecessary repairs and saving me money, the technician and Debbie recommended a return on another day to ensure a proper diagnosis was completed.
I returned a week later and Debbie was ready for me with a loaner car waiting. I left my vehicle overnight and once again the repair schedule that Debbie promised was adhered to with every discount available applied. Though Debbie was not working on the day I picked up my vehicle, she still ensured that I was taken care of. Todd Delmore was there bright and early at 7:30am on a Saturday with all my paperwork ready and the car prepared to drive away. 
Overall, the service I received from all the staff including Todd, the technician, but especially Debbie Oliver, was outstanding. I was never left uninformed, all schedules were strictly adhered to, and I was provided with alternate transportation both times insuring as little inconvenience as possible. While I may have saved a dollar or two by shopping around, I highly doubt I would ever have received anything close to the level of service that Debbie and the rest of the staff provided. Well done Debbie and Wilson-Niblett."
positive,My family and I were on our way to Vegas when our engine mounts broke. Mark at Major Auto Service helped right away to get the car repaired quickly and at a great price. He got us back on the road and in great shape! A great repair shop in Vegas at great prices!!
positive,"I went here to get my serpentine belt replaced and a transmission flushed and these guys were friendly and efficient.  They took the time to explain things to me and I felt comfortable that they were making the appropriate recommendations without trying to charge me for things I didn't need.  It was ready in just a few hours as promised so I was able to pick it up same day.  Only complaint is that they left my transmission fluid dipstick out of place under the hood so it was just laying on top, but fortunately it didn't fall down and screw up anything since it was laying flat on the top, but if it had that could've been a more serious problem.  So I subtracted a star for that since it seemed a bit careless."
positive,"Went in to get a oil change and transmission I had coupons and saved a couple hundred I'm sure. The assistant manager Tim I think was thorough and helpful when some places want to get you in and out I've never had someone lift my car and show me with my own eyes the issues I had going on I'm not trusting of allot of these places, but that showed me my issues were real and honest. Definitely recommend."
positive,"I was driving a used car (new to me) from Palm Springs to Denver. The check engine light came on before Vegas. I thought ""oh s@$&"". Brought it into Tony's and immediately I knew I was at the right place. They gave me an honest assessment of the diagnostic report, and though there was potential for a bigger problem they were able to assure me that I'd be fine all the way through the mountains. Saved me from all that stress that I was so worked up about. I felt like family at this place and I'm sure you will too!"
positive,"Update :  Jeremy the manager called and offered to do the remaining repairs for free. I appreciate their effort to correct this. Thanks Sun Devil.

*While I appreciate the quick and friendly service I always get from Sun Devil, my last experience was not so good. I brought my car in because I had a check engine light going on and off and the car was running rough. I was told new spark plugs and a fuel system treatment would fix it. I paid the $650 for the repair and went on my way. The next day my engine light came on and the same problem persisted. I brought it back in and they explained that now I needed oxygen sensors and that it would be another $700. I do not know if my car needed the prior repairs but something is wrong and maybe they didn't diagnose it correctly."
positive,"This review is long overdue. I had worked many years for a competitor. However, I left I wanted to purchase a fun and dependable car so I purchased a new 2009 SCION xB from Earnhardt with assistance from accessories Subject Matter Expert with Gary Childress. My plan was to gift my son slightly used xB when he received his DL within two years. Much to my dismay my son although very athletic and master dance moves crank dat Lion King/Superman etc., however could NOT master manual transmission (new clutch installed during lessons). 

My (LOL) xB now has over 189K miles with numerous trips to Tucson (work 5 days a week for 8 months), Disneyland, San Diego and my hometown of Seattle it has never failed due to Vanessa Villalobos the BEST Service Advisor in the world. Whenever I've had an issue she has solution with the usual GREAT price and service. I will continue going to Earnhardt until the death of my xB. 

And they offer free shuttle service in addition to free coffee, water, POPCORN, and donuts while you wait. Can't beat that with a baseball bat,"
positive,"I own two 2012 Sorentos and recently had the transmission fluid replaced on both. I waited on-site for the work to be completed while enjoying fresh coffee (at 2:30pm, very nice). Jose, my service advisor, was professional and did not push additional parts or services. Very nice. 

I used discount coupons to offset the BS 10% ""shop supplies"" charges most shops like to tack on to the bill these days to mask the real cost of the service you authorize. Get on their mail/email list to receive coupons. If it wasn't for the shop supplies charge, I would have awarded 5 stars."
positive,"This was my first time using 5 Star Auto and they now have a new customer.  Not only did they treat me right, they took care of my truck which I had to bring back a few times for a mischievous vacuum leak.  They charged me for the 1st fix and then after having another check engine light come on, they diagnosed and fixed without adding to my charges.   They got the tenacious issue fixed even though due to my schedule- months later, they still honored the fix and made sure they got it right!  

Some things are not so cut and dry and instead of going all in and charging a huge repair..they started with the little things that could have been causing the issue, or were in fact causing a portion of the issue.  Along the way, another issue came about and they repaired that as well and not once did I feel nervous about having my truck there or how I would be taken care of.

Bobby was great and is VERY knowledgeable about what he does and his staff is as well.  Mike at the front was on point and I always felt that no matter what, the issue would be fixed.  

This was my first time at 5 Star which came highly recommended by friends on Facebook and I felt like a long time customer and part of the family so to speak.  

They know what they're doing their, they think outside the box and with respect to my old truck (98 Ford Expedition), they fixed the issue but never pressured me for a major fix that would out cost the value of the truck.  They do smart and good business there and they now have a new customer.

I live in Henderson, not close to them at all but because they do good biz, I'll be returning for my future repair needs.

Thanks Bobby and Mikey!  5 Star Auto is deserving of 5 Stars!"
positive,"Great Service!!!
We took our '94 Cadillac here on the recommendation of a friend.  We had tried to get our car repaired at Ted Wiens Firestone on Rainbow twice without success and at the cost of over $500.  When we took it into 5 Star Auto Repair,  Bobby diagnosed the problem within 2 minutes.  He had to have a hose assembly made special to replace the old one that had a huge tear in it (they must have blind mechanics at Ted Wiens).  We took it back in when the part came in and Bobby had it fixed in no time at a reasonable price and we were treated with respect.  Wish we had known about 5 Star Auto Repair earlier.  We are thankful to have finally found a business we can feel safe taking our cars to for repair.  Thanks Bobby!"
positive,"I purchased new tires and brakes from this location 17 years ago, and now that I'm living in the area again, they were my first go to.
I called and spoke with James on the phone. He was very kind and personable and took the time to look up my vehicle's requirements and provided me quotes and all of the information necessary regarding the warranties. Often when I call auto shops the individuals on the phone are not personable and act like I'm bothering them. This is not what I got from James.
When I arrived Gina helped me out. She was very fun and polite and we had some good conversations. She really took the time to talk with me and made me feel like I could really trust Big O. 
I ended up getting new tires, a warranty, alignment plan, and they flushed the brakes and transmission. The vehicle is 6 years old, so it wasn't shocking that this needed to be done. She kept me up to date on the status of my car and called me when it was ready.
I felt the pricing was fair. I can't say anything bad about the experience."
positive,"I needed an oil change and general safety inspection, but I was having trouble finding a place with decent reviews that took appointments and had weekend hours. I called this AAMCO and the guy said that they usually only do transmission work on the weekend, so their mechanics/general tech guys aren't in. However, he offered to schedule me for a Saturday morning appointment as he was going to be in that weekend anyway. I was happy to accept his offer and the actual appointment went very well. The man I spoke with and who worked on my car is very personable and accommodating, and the maintenance he performed on my car was done well and priced fairly. I don't know if they will always be able to accommodate my schedule, but my experience thus far is that they are at least willing to try."
positive,"Just left with a 6.2l Yukon sounding like a v8 is supposed to. Did a highway run at 75mph.  The Magnaflow they recommended put the perfect amount of growl into wide open throttle with little to no noticeable drone at low rpm in 4 or 8 cylinder mode. This is the 4th or 7th time in 20 years these guys listened to what I asked for and nailed it on the first go. 

Need muffler/exhaust work?  Go here everytime."
positive,"Found about All-Tranz by word of mouth, I have been in the automotive business a long time and they have done multiple transmission's for me in a timely manner at a fair price!  Sully and Joe do a nice job."
positive,"Twice these guys have helped us with great customer service. We blew our transmission and while they couldn't rebuild a transmission on a Suzuki, they knew who could and got us in right away. Fixed at a fair price. The second time we had a muffler issue. We dropped in, they took it into the shop and had it fixed in 45 minutes at an extremely fair price. We will always use them from now on.  Great service and very knowledgeable."
positive,"I was very pleased with my service this time. This particular Wilhelm Garage has a new manager (as far as I can tell). Chris has moved to corporate, and while I liked him and thought he was a good guy, there's no doubt that we had a few issues with Wilhelm's service when he was there, and after the last debacle with our overheating issue, we considered not returning. However, since that time I have taken this particular vehicle back a few times, and each experience has been positive. We had Wilhelm take the wheel locks off the car, and while doing so, they broke the cap on the rim. They could have easily failed to inform us, but they took responsibility and ordered a new cap. Chris was also very helpful in referring us to someone who could do transmission work that they couldn't do at the shop. Our last visit was just as positive. We had a leak in the transmission, and it was a seal that Wilhelms could fix. I was very grateful for the quick service and reasonable price--two luxuries not often experienced while servicing a car in general. Most important, however, is that while I was waiting for the car, some apparent ""big whigs"" in the company visited the store and were talking to the new manager (can't recall his name). I overheard him say that he isn't in business to gouge his customers...that he is just trying to make a living and provide his customers with the best service possible at the best price. I have to say, I didn't think anyone in the auto repair industry possessed that degree of integrity. My experience has ALWAYS been being gouged and taken advantage of. That comment from him alone will ensure that I continue taking my vehicle to Wilhelms for the foreseeable future."
positive,"I have a 25 year old car I love.  In fact, prior to writing this review I was filling out the forms to get my classic plates!

After a bad experience with what used to be a good mechanic I took my car in for Chris to check out.  It was refreshing to have someone immediately know what I was talking about not just blow smoke up my skirt. 

One of the repairs was major and since I have owned this vehicle for a couple of decades, I knew what was wrong with rear suspension and how much it would cost. The other issue really just proved how bad the last mechanics were because what should have been done in a major tune up hadn't been done.

To cut to the chase I dropped bank but I'm OK with that.  It was still a lot less than what the dealer would have charged me and I got a couple things fixed that the dealer wouldn't do anyway... including a paint to match passenger side mirror where I broke off the outer portion of it years ago and replacing the automatic lock on the passenger side. 

I still have the issue with the brakes being grabby but forgot to ask Chris to look at them.  (FYI: I went to Palladin because I dropped bank for new tires and brakes at another place and the car went in working fine and came out with alleged transmission problems.  Old brakes, find.  New brakes super grabby and the place blamed it on the transmission.  Funny how I didn't have an alleged transmission problem when I brought the car in.  That's almost as funny as the dealer telling me I needed a new ""U-Joint"" when I actually had a bubble in a front tire that was causing the car to wobble!)"
positive,"While in Vegas I contacted Tony's and went there to have my check engine light diagnosed. Fast, no bs, straight talk, took a look, concluded I was good to go, and didn't charge me when they could have...guess who is in my cellphone now when I or a friend needs a mechanic in Vegas?"
positive,"Frick Park Automotive has some mixed reviews floating around. But because they're conveniently located for me (and because some of their negative reviews had nothing to do with their service), I decided to give them a shot.  I've taken my car there three times now, all for routine service.

First, I simply needed to have a flat fixed in January. They turned it around quickly. When I went to pick it up, the owner simply handed me the keys and said ""Have a nice day."" ""What do I owe you?"" ""Don't worry about it."" True, for these folks fixing a flat is a simple task, but I expected to pay a few bucks, as is common. 

Purely based on that gesture and my interactions with the owner (and knowing how much I hate taking the car to the dealership), I went to FPA for my inspection and oil change. There was no hassle, no hidden fees, no pressure to purchase unnecessary parts or services. Solid.

Shortly after my inspection, my windshield cracked nearly the whole way across thanks to a rock being kicked up on the highway. After having it replaced elsewhere, I had to go back to FPA to get the stickers replaced. Again, simple, friendly, no hassle.

The folks at FPA quickly earned my trust. Not only are they more convenient and less of a hassle than the dealership, their prices are reasonable, and I'd much rather support a local business than a corporate one. So far, I've nothing but good experiences with Frick Park Automotive."
positive,"Best service knowledge ever. Would recommend this above all auto shops. Just walked in Waited under an hour to fix check engine light, they ordered the parts and had them there within 24 hours fixed and gone no issues customer service at top quality. This place goes the extra mile to help find what is the problem with the car , without a sales pitch. By far the best recommend to all anthem and 7 hills residents. Go Mike you rock."
positive,"Masterworks is awesome! Extremely honest, Boruch and the guys do great work and are trustworthy. Ive had work done at Masterworks in the past. I recently had to take my car to their shop for a check engine light. They took a look at it, spent considerable time coming up with a plan that made sense for me. They didn't charge me a diagnostic fee, even when I ultimately did not get the work done due to personal reasons. My go-to mechanic in Cleveland!"
positive,"On July 7th of 2016, I had just moved to Las Vegas and was in the search of a better life for my 3 children, 10, 9 and 7, and I. We were living in Montana without a lot of opportunity to have a better life. I was in search of a home, and my children were staying with my mother in Montana until I had everything figured out. I was driving a 2003 Mitsubishi eclipse and decided that it wasn't the best vehicle for 3 kids, especially with the crazy drivers in Las Vegas, so I went to DRIVETIME. I knew I didn't have the best credit due to the situation with their father 5 years prior and I was working 3 jobs so I didn't have a lot of time to truly shop around. I came across this 2012 Hyundai Sonata and just fell in love with it. THAT WAS THE CAR FOR ME. I talked with Detroy Love and the paperwork was signed. I got all the coverage they offered thinking that I would be covered if anything should happen, that was the whole reason for getting a new car from a dealership anyway.

Within the first 5 days of the sale, I took the car down to one of their approved specialist. A Midas company located on Maryland Blvd. I noticed some hesitation when Idling, almost like a faint purr vibration. I talked with the guys at Midas and they told me the car was in perfect condition but if anything did happen, in the notes there would be in writing the vibration when idling so they could go back to it if needed. Cool I could deal with that, I got the warranty anyway and if there was an issue, at least it was documented.

I found a house and my kids were brought down from Montana from the help of my dad on August 4. We finally had the space we needed, and car big enough and my family was back together and we were doing better than ever. I was elated. This was everything I was working so hard for, little that I knew it would be short lived. On August 13th my check engine light came on. I called Averex and told them hey, yo, I've had the car for just over a month and the check engine light is on. They told me to take it down to American Auto and Tire, one of their approved specialist. They ran the diagnosis and came up with an error code P2191. This error code could have been anything from electrical, to fuel to anything. They told me that they needed at least a day to go through the vehicle to diagnosis it specifically.

I didn't have the availability to just leave my car and still be able to get to all my jobs and take care of my kids, so I called Averex to see if a rental vehicle could be provided under warranty. They told me I was more than welcome to get a rental vehicle but they would not provide it for me. If it was approved, I would be reimbursed accordingly. Well first of all, you can only get a rental car if you have a credit card, and I did not. I've never had a credit card and never even thought of applying for one with my credit being the way it is (the reason I went to DRIVETIME in the first place). Second of all, I could not afford to rent a vehicle and have it reimbursed whenever. Hey yo guys, single mom, 3 kids, all starting school, new house, new city, and doing it all myself, above anything I had done before, budgeting on the high side to make sure that the kids are in a safe area and in good school district, we're not on state aid in ANY WAY and not even child support from the kid's dad who started over, never looked back, and working under the table. I just couldn't take on more than I already was.

Well I ended up just hoping nothing would happen, that it could be fixed before the kids and I ended up stranded somewhere. About a week later, I was filling up gas and for some reason when I got in the car the check engine light was off. So I again was hopeful and thought it could have just been the gas cap, knowing they need a check engine light to run the gadget again anyway I just hoped I would be in a better situation when the light came back on.

On October 31st, My little sister came down to Vegas to help me. Things were hectic and I hadn't found a steady babysitter yet being new to the area and not knowing many people. That Friday, November 4th, the car hesitated starting as I was coming home from work. I came straight home and parked it. The next morning as I was getting ready to head to the store, the car wouldn't start at all. I tried to call Averex but they only are open Monday- Friday 8-5pm. I then proceeded to call DRIVETIME and talk to Detroy, who sold me the car and told him the situation, and then talked to about 3 different managers that said there was nothing they could do and to call Averex first thing Monday morning. Thankfully I got a hold of one of my co workers who was able to get me to and from work until then.

First thing Monday morning I called Averex and got the car towed to American Auto and Tire, and it was ready by Wednesday morning, I woke up around 7 and started walking to pick up the car, it took me 2 hours to get there from my house, but being as I am from Montana I have never taken a b"
positive,Nick and the rest of the group are amazing! Last time I got my car repaired they came back with a quote 1/3 of anyone else and when I went to pay  it was even cheaper than that.  As a female I usually get screwed with car stuff but not these guys! Recommend to everyone!
positive,"After being ripped off by a previous person (not from this company) to fix what I was 99.9% sure was wrong...Sun devil auto saved my sanity and car! I realize I am a female in a mans world walking into an auto place but I grew up around men who worked on cars. I don't know it all but I sure know enough! My car would loose power and make a rattling noise when I would try to speed up fairly fast or just enough to get up to speed on a highway. My check engine light was on which gave a misfire and catalytic converter code. Apparently the other guy said it was my spark plugs. Ok, that's fair because I hadn't changed them in 4-5 yrs. same problem happened a day later! Go back...mass airflow thing. Hmmmm ok. Changed that and a day later same issue. So you can imagine my frustration which I tried to contain walking into this company. I'm human though so I'm sure some of it spilled on them when I first arrived. Sorry if it did :-/ I was done being told guesses and my money being spent with no results. I was firm when I walked in here and explained why. The front desk guy (can't remember his name sorry but he has brown hair/beard w/glasses) and Bob were EXTREMELY patient with me and professional. I appreciated them being confident that they could fix the problem with no charges that weren't needed. It was the very thing I was 99.9% sure of. These guys found it and fixed it all in the same day!!! Bob also confirmed that if I drove off and had the issue again I could come back for no charge! The car has been running beautifully and I choose to be so happy with this company. I work across the street and bragged about my experience."
positive,"They don't just supply tires they handle all auto repairs.  They  repaired my transmission and replaced the air conditioner compressor for me.  They were very fast, fair priced, and very nice.  I like George he's a good guy.
I should have taken my car to him long before now.
You'd like George."
positive,"We have been Jiffy Lube customers for 15 years.  They are quick, convenient and they do a great job.  Why mess with a good thing, right?  Recently, we had some difficulty with our Suburban.  We thought it was just electrical problems relating to our 4x4 switch.  When we took it to our mechanic they said there could be a possibility that our transfer casing was tampered with.  There are only two shops that touch our cars: Jiffy Lube and Gruelichs.  We called Jiffy Lube and spoke to the manager on duty, Gus.  He was very open to listen and actually came over to the mechanics to inspect the vehicle.  Gus notified his supervisor and sent us to the Jiffy Lube Customer Service representative, as per their policy.  We thought we were going to get the run around.  Mind you, it was during 4th of July holiday, so it did take some time.  We eventually were contacted by the rep who was going to send out the District Service Manager to OUR mechanic to inspect the problem with us!  They did not try to attempt to deny responsibility.  They, in our eyes, were taking as many steps as they could towards accountability.  Just to be sure that there was no bias, Gruelichs asked a third party to open the transfer casing and inspect it.  If it was tampered with we would know immediately.  This morning, we all stood around at State to State transmissions as they opened the casing.  What we found was that JIFFY LUBE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE!  It showed normal wear and tear.  As hard as it was for us to swallow that we would have to pay for what is a common repair to older GM 4x4 vehicles, we were glad that the establishment that we had trusted for 15 years with our three vehicles was still reputable in our eyes.  They did everything right.  From the local manager, Gus, to Judy the Customer Service rep, to Darren the District Service Manager, they all listened to the customer.  They came to us, even with the possibility they may have to pay the bill.  They were kind and considerate.  I have to say thank you to Jiffy Lube for not dismissing us.  Thank you for years of good service to our vehicles and our family.  Thank you for putting the customer first.  Good job guys!"
positive,"I was a victim of a parking lot hit and run. My Ford Explorer suffered a large dent on the rear tailgate. Dave and his team were great. They gave me the number of a car rental place near his business. Once I arrived, he called to get me picked up. I was in and out for the drop off in less than 30 minutes. His team was able to get my car repaired (I needed a new tailgate) in a week. I got my car back and the work was great and the car was nice and clean. I would highly recommend."
positive,"If you need a simple exhaust or muffler fix, they got it here for cheap. For the low so to speak. If you need a repair that requires extensive labor requiring the engine to be removed or if the exhaust leak is close to the manifold, they will not be able to do it. You cannot make an appointment and need to wait in the waiting room. It reminds me of The Walking Dead. Pretty weird but life is weird."
positive,It might be the last good honest muffler shop in town.   The guys were straight forward and never trys to upsell me on anything.
positive,"Took my truck to a local Chevy dealership for a check engine light their quote for repairs was $8000. 

Not wanting to just fork over 8k I wanted a second opinion. 
I brought it to Nick at T&M, had them look it over and what a pleasant surprise $200 for repairs not the $8000 Chevy recommended . 

I have done business with T&M on numerous occasions they always do stellar work and as a female I have never felt they have ever tried to take advantage of my situation. 
Work is always done quickly and at a fair price. 

Thanks guys, keep up the great work"
positive,"Made an appointment.   Staff greeted me and was ready to work on my van.  Service was speedy.  Oil change, filter, engine flush, transmission fluid change, tires rotated, alignment - all finished within 90 minutes.  Solon did wonderful and additionally had free popcorn and free drinks.  Thanks Dan and Terrence and the tech too!"
positive,"I own an older Toyota vehicle and I needed the catalytic converter replaced in order to pass the emissions test, something that due to a new family addition, I discovered only days before my registration expired. 

I called Performance and they quoted me a replacement at just under $300 - on Toyotas such as mine the CC (as the experts call it*) is bolted on and no welding is required so it is a quick and typical job - I should have had it replaced at 150K mi, but that's the exact type of thing I don't know.

I dropped my car off that afternoon and picked it up the next morning, ready to go, with a few days left to pass the test and re-register the car - nothing special in the appearance of the shop, but these guys prioritize the customer and the work, even for a boring, non-custom, old-Toyota CC* replacement, and by the looks of the shop they do plenty of custom muffler work that I don't understand but clearly some people get very excited about. Very pleased all-around. 

*I have no idea what experts call it, I just didn't want to type 'catalytic converter' agai-- dang it now I wasted any saved space gained via that abbreviation, plus even more talking about it! So much regret."
positive,"Justin was so great! Supper knowledgeable and does not push /try to tell you your car needs any extra work!

They did FREE oil chabges for all vets on veterans day:)! 

Both me &my bf came in. His check engine light was on &they figured out that it was just because he didn't scew on the gas cap after gassing up hard enough so that was good bewa. 
I got an oil change there for a good price and they changed out my oil plug which was apparently the wrong one put on @a crappier place(i only paid $5for the new one), but its a good thing they did b4 it caused any damage:)

Great place, good service,  pleasant experience! :)"
positive,"When I was a teenager, our family took our cars to ""Nick"" the mechanic. He was in business for decades because he did good work and he was honest. These days, with most of your options being dealerships or corporate chains it seems this is becoming very hard to find. Matthews Exxon harkens back to the day when people took pride in their work and charged a fair price. Let me repeat that: the mechanics at Matthews Exxon take pride in their work. If you own a car that is out of warranty and you are looking for a mechanic that won't deceive you to steal your hard earned money, this is the place to find HONESTY. For those interested, here are a few cases:
1. I had a strange braking noise that was only there sometimes. They kept my car and used it until the noise popped up enough times to figure it out. It turned out to be a small part. If I had gone to a dealer, they would have replaced the whole brake system after bringing it in 10 times because they just don't make the effort most of the time to diagnose. They just replace things until they find the part that was bad. That's fine if you are under warranty but if not, its a horribly expensive way to fix cars. The whole thing cost less than two hundred bucks and Scott even had my car washed while he had it.
2. My truck had a check engine light come on. Scott sent it to another independent shop that had a more expensive computer system to make sure the codes he was pulling were correct. What? A shop that works with other shops to solve a problem? Incredible. Considering how hard manufacturers are working to make everything proprietary, it is great to see shops working together to make sure they do a good job.
3. I have Takata airbags and have gotten cards about the airbag recall. I had a coupon from the stealership for an oil change so I asked my teenage son to bring it there so I could finally get in writing whether or not they had a solution for the airbags (they didn't). They told him (thinking it was his truck) that he needed an oil pan gasket, transmission gasket and rear main seal ""right away before he has serious engine damage"" to the tune of $3,800. I brought it to Exxon who usually services it. They said everything was fine. Just a drip from the dipstick tube. That was two years ago. Nothing has blown up. Could he have said ""sure, I'll do it for $2,000""? Yeah, but remember that thing I said about being honest? Imagine - the dealer would have taken almost four thousand dollars from my kid because they thought they could get away with it!
4. Today, I brought my truck over to a national tire chain in Matthews with a small nail and slow leak. Right from the start, I knew they were going to try to bullsh*t me into a new tire when they made me sign off that I understand the tire might not be fixable. Instead, they said I might need FOUR new tires because they said the tire was not fixable and they could not order a matching one! I drove over to Matthews Exxon mad that I didn't go there in the first place. It took about 6 minutes and cost $16.05 with tax.

There is a reason some small shops are around forever and never need to advertise while many chains and dealers need to churn as many customers as they can because they can't keep repeat business. It's a lesson that corporate gigs in many fields just can't seem (or don't want) to learn. Thanks for taking care of my cars for many years. We appreciate you!"
positive,"Came here the other day for a check engine light and the person at the front desk named Mike fixed it for me. 

The place seemed very reliable and professional so I came back today to get a car I just purchased inspected and they explained what was wrong with my car and what my options were to fix it. The whole experience was very easy and made me feel better about driving my used car. I highly recommend going!"
positive,"Just needed to get my check engine light diagnostic and Ryan M. helped me out and helped me understand what needed to be replaced, didn't have the part in store but offered to special order it. Excellent customer service even at 1 am!"
positive,"I have not been able to find a trustworthy mechanic until I found this place! I usually come here for my oil changes but when my check engine light came on a few weeks before my registration was due and I needed a smog check, I panicked. I took it in and Joe took care of it right away. I was worried because I would have to do whatever repairs was necessary in order to pass smog.  A few hours later, they let me know that they found nothing wrong, they reset the PCM, did a drive cycle, and even took it in for a smog for me.  When I picked up my car, I had a passing smog certificate waiting for me. I didn't even ask for that.  They truly go out of their way to make your experience as pleasant as possible. They could have easily told me something was wrong and charged me a ton of money to fix  it and I would never know because my check engine light was on and I needed it fixed.  This place is honest, trustworthy, and reliable. Literally the best place ever. I would recommend it to anyone."
positive,Wow these guys are awesome! I've never had such a good experience at car places. But these guys are different. Super friendly and go out of their way to help you. Owner got me in the same day and was done the next. They did an awesome job. I will recommend to anyone that needs muffler work. Pricing is very affordable. Cant say enough good things. Thank you!
positive,"I am sorry to see some poor reviews at this location.  Chris, Mike and Sandy saved my pocket over $800.00 a few days ago.  I had been using Community Tire Pros on 32nd St. & took it in for diagnostics on check engine light.  Community Tire told me it would be 1K plus & then no guarantee it would pass emissions (due @ end of this mo).  I told them no & left.  On a whim I stopped at this location of C & R & Chris said he would diagnose @ no charge (Community chgd me 90.00 less 20.00 cpn).  They found leaky hose & gasket, fixed it all for under 300.00 & better yet told me I would pass emissions which I did today.  They will get my business in the future."
positive,"UPDATE: I've been here multiple times since and have nothing but great things to say about Joe's Auto! Great customer service and they do a great job explaining exactly what needs to be done and why.

So I had never been to this place but my dealership said I needed all this work done on my car and I was looking at getting it done someplace else that was a little less expensive.  

I called Joe's because I got a flier from them in the mail. I asked th e man who answered about pricing for a transmission flush (my dealership said I needed it at 30,000 miles). He put me on hold for a few then came back and asked how many miles my car had and for more info on the car. He looked it up and told me that I actually didn't need this service for a long time, and that the dealership was probably trying to get more $$. He told me to check the manufacturer's book but said according to them I didn't need this service until a lot later. He also gave me some great advice about what I would probably need to get done in the next year so I would be aware.

This man could have told me to come in,  done the service and taken my $, as I didn't ask if I needed it, I just asked for a price. Instead he went out of his way to not only make sure I needed it but also was honest with me that I didn't. 

It is rare to find someone in this industry that would give up money in the interest of honesty and they have just gained a loyal customer, when I actually do need service on my car :)"
positive,If your looking for a reliable transmission shop forget about all others locations busters transmissions is the only place you should take you vehicle here are some reasons 1 I you love your car and you want someone who gives a damn about your car there the guys 2 they make sure your happy with the work your car needs 3 they don't ever try to up sell you into fixing crap that's not broken 4 their mechanic is top notch he knows what he's doing and my truck for example had a leak in the transfer case in the rear of the transmission at first we thought it was the rear of the transmission it's self they said they're call me and sure enough they cleaned my entire motor and transmission and told me exactly what was wrong and what needed to be done and with no time at all my truck was done and it drove like a dream 5 and of course the most important thing to everyone they do warranty the work they do and you won't believe how fair the prices for the type of work they do and the service they provide I recommend you look no further and take you car straight to them and have them do a wonderful job and have your car or truck driving like a dream again with no worries in the world
positive,"After just 2 weeks of being in Arizona, I had another incident added to my string of bad luck. I was trying to register my car after having been pulled over and, luckily, let of with a warning, when my transmission lines blew all the way across town. I called my insurance for a tow and then a brand new Amazonian friend recommended Virginia Auto to bring my car to. I could kiss this new friend. Pascal answered when I called to let him know I was coming on a tow and he couldn't have been nicer. When I arrived, he got me checked in and offered me options to get home, since they couldn't look at my car until the next day. Luckily, though, I had a ride on the way. 

Via text the morning, he let me know what the problem was and the cost. Once I ok'd , he was on it and I had my car back at 5 pm. Not once did these guys try to upsell me on anything I didn't need or ask for. In fact, they washed my car before giving it back to me!! Who does that? These guys, apparently. 

I've never had such a good experience with a shop in the years I've owned cars. I will definitely go back to Virginia Auto if I have further issues with this or any future vehicle."
positive,"I'm their customer for almost two years - 3027 St Rose Pkwy, Henderson -(regular oil change & car maintenance service), the staff is ALWAYS so friendly, & their prices are pretty fair if not cheaper than the market actually (when I first dealt with them I used to shop around for the best price, before I decided to just call them directly if anything came up & set an appointment!) I never had a problem.
But what really made a huge impression, was when one of my friends who live in SF bought a car from here LV, he had an emergency & couldn't come to pickup his car so I offered to drive it to him to SF. The car had a break malfunction light,  some noise, plus for sure I wanted to check if it is ready for a 500 miles trip (oil, transmission oil, tires & its pressure ...etc), I called and set an appointment, and this is what happened:
- They checked all the oils & liquids in the car!
- They checked the tires & tire pressure!
- They checked the break levels!
- They did the diagnostics for the breaks light & he told me it is not an urgent thing it can safely wait till I deliver it to my friend in SF! (I'm their customer they knew it is not my car, I just told them what is going on)
- They checked the source of the noise & told me it is also safe to wait till it got delivered to my friend in SF.
Notice that for the last two he could easy tell me it is important to fix those & just charge me whatever he wants, & I would never know! but they ARE HONEST!
The surprise was after he finished, & when I gave him my CC to charge me, he told me I'm their customer & he didn't do anything really & he will not charge me anything!!!! (it took them at least 20 min to check my car!!)
I insisted to charge me at least the labor & his time, he insisted NO, because I'm their customer & this the least they can do!!! I swear I didn't know what to say!!! (I wish I know his name, despite they all are the same in the way they treat their customers)
When I told my wife back home she didn't believe there is still good people like this anymore, neither did my friend who didn't believe what happened too!
Really thank you so much guys for everything, for the warm friendly treatment, great prices, your coffee , and just everything.............."
positive,"Had to take my truck in for a transmission rebuild. Larry, who was the owner was very helpful and down to earth. They did an awesome job on my GMC Sierra and I also have a 24,000 mile warranty. Will definitely be back future fixes. Thank you guys!"
positive,"Let me start out by saying my review is all on my customer service experience at the time of my first visit. After seeing all the negative reviews, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical coming here. My husband's 2015 370z's check engine light came on so I decided to give them a try. I was disappointed to hear that one of the catalytic converters needs to be replaced and we're just outside the 80K warranty (car is at 84K) so it's going to cost just over $1400, (was sure wishing they had some sort of grace period but guess not).  I did not have time to leave our car, so my follow up appointment is this Friday. 
So let me share why I gave them 5 stars - when I called and made the appointment, I let them know I'd be coming there but will be waiting and need a place to be able to set up my laptop and work. Upon my arrival, Stu (Stewart Amrhein) greeted me, found a quiet place for me with a table & outlet for me to set up my laptop and plug in. He was very communicative and super considerate when I was on a phone call so as not to interrupt. I can't express enough how wonderful his customer service skills were - actually quite amazing and something very rare these days. I'll be returning this Friday, but this time to drop our car off for the service, *fingers crossed* it goes as well as the first customer service went and I don't have any other service surprises like some have posted."
positive,One day I intended to get a transmission fluid change. There was some miscommunication with the staff and me and it took longer than it should. A simple 2 hour or less job turned into at 5 hour job. The management listened to me and compensated with a free service. Never in my entire life have i seen ANY bussiness try to please their customers like this. I will definetly be going back.
positive,"Just left the shop and very satisfied. I was pretty worried about finding a shop that won't try to rip me off being a new resident without my soCal connections I once had.  After spending an hour calling around for pricing, I found performance muffler.  I just wanted my direct fit catalytic converters i bought from Canada installed.  I was quoted as high as $760 just for the install something that's a direct fit at some other ""reputable"" muffler shops.  I call Performance Mufflers and not only did he quote me the best price in town and he said I'll try to get you out of here as fast as I can do you spend only the low end quote.  My Infiniti was definitely a little more complex because of the tight space allowed for the mechanic to get to.  After what seems like no time compared to the task at hand, I was ready to go.  Asked me what price I quoted them and let me go with the lowest quoted price.  Amazing! Being a guy who is in the auto industry and a car enthusiast, why wouldn't I tell my friends and family to go here? Great work and even better customer service.  If you go somewhere else, you're losing out big time!"
positive,"Brian and crew were polite and went out of their way to make sure my truck got ready for emissions with a new muffler.  Second time I've been in, will go back.  Quite pleased with my experience."
positive,"BBS accredited since 2003! Great place with reasonable pricing. The labor they charged me at $80/hr which seemed fair, they explained what was wrong with the van and walked me through the repairs that were needed.  Got a transmission rebuilt with an after market transmission cooler added on to help out with my stop and go driving. They also paid for the tow to get it to them which came out to being about $70 savings.

I highly recommend this place. I will return to have a followup check."
positive,"The service here was amazing. They were super fast and very friendly. They won't charge for unnecessary work like some other mechanics or dears ships. I had a check engine light on for my airflow sensor and it was checked for free. They even showed me how to change it if I wanted to do it myself and cleaned my filter to see if the check engine light will go off. Amazing service, will come back again."
positive,"My husband had a minor accident and had to take his Xterra in for some TLC.
His family has had a great body shop in the Glendale CA area for 50 years and he knows the business and customer service very well.
He was hesitant to get his car repaired anywhere else, but since moving to Las Vegas he had to seek help locally.
When they repaired the Xterra he did not know what to expect but was completely satisfied with ABC's repair process.
They completely informed him of what to expect throughout the repair of his car and advises that he highly recommends this group if you should need auto auto body repair.
I am looking at the car myself this morning for the first time and it is pristeen and washed so beautifully!"
positive,"Gabe came out in the evening to look at our washer. It was making a weird noise. I initially thought it was a belt, but because of the age of the washer, it didn't have a belt. It was the transmission. This man ROCKS. He's easy to chat with, SUPER NICE, and very knowledgeable about appliances. Didn't try to take us, gave us a good deal on the repair, fixed it and was on his way...Thank you Gabe for fixing our problem washer. I absolutely recommend One Shot Installation for all your needs..Give them a call...We will call him again when we have another issue for sure..Thank you Gabe"
positive,"Great, honest estimate and repair. $120 while I wait, where speedy wanted $650 to replace entire muffler for a small whole in the pipe before the muffler because the stainless steel muffler was ""probably"" rusting from the inside. When pushed for a repair estimate speedy wanted $400."
positive,"UPDATE: Wilhem did call me today and went out of their way to help me and make this right! Their customer service was excellent, and I was very happy with the way things ended. Thank you Wilhelm for following through!

The car work may actually be good (that remains to be seen), but they are extremely underhanded and dishonest. I just got back from trying unsuccessfully to be reimbursed by Chevy since the work Wilhelm did on my car was under warranty, and I wasn't informed until after the fact. My check engine light had come on so I googled the nearest repair shop which happened to be Wilhelm on Indian School/Litchfield and was fooled by the reviews. They ran a diagnostic on my car and informed me it was the ""cam shaft and actuators"" and that the bill would be $738. This was the first time I had dealt with a car dealership as a single lady and maybe that played into this I don't know. I clearly  didn't know much about car repair and didn't get a second opinion- my bad!  I went to pick up my car and that is when I found out if I had taken it to the dealer it would have been covered under warranty. I was then told to go ""talk to Chevy"" as I had already paid Wilhelm. Not surprisingly Chevy told me they couldn't reimburse me as they didn't do the work, but that it WAS under warranty, and the shop ""would have definitely realized these were warrantable parts, but they chose to take advantage of me instead"". If you are looking for an honest mechanic this it NOT the place for you, and I learned a very expensive lesson!"
positive,My mother was taking an emergency trip to Flagstaff when her check engine light went on just outside of Boulder City. She pulled into the Big O Tire for some help to insure she would make the trip. And the staff went above and beyond to make sure she would be safe. Their thoughtfulness and concern for her safety went above and beyond!
positive,"Five stars and a bravo to Wolbert's! I came here for an estimate recommended by insurance and they seemed nice so I decided to have my car repaired here as well. I called and set up an appointment. When I came in to drop off, at 9am Thursday, they called the rental car place for me to pick me up. (Little story)As we waited for the rental we were surprised and amused by their electric powered train set and pond. My son dropped a couple toy cars in the pond and I went and retrieved them. Well upon doing so I brushed up on a turtle! They have 6 turtles I believe! Anyway... The next day (Friday) at 4pm we got a call that the car was done! Well the repair looks flawless and not only that, but they washed my car! And not just the outside, but the inside as well! My back window hasn't looked so clear in a long time! Very nice and friendly employees and great auto repair! Thank you Wolbert's!"
positive,"What a great help J.D was , such great customer service and great work on my car ! 10/10 recommendation . 

Took my car back to Sun auto needed some minor repairs with the transmission . What would I say , who needs a dealership when I have found friendly and trustworthy mechanics at Sun Auto . These men are servicing me in my best interest and not worried about filling their pockets ! The master mechanic Jerry was very knowledgeable about all makes and models of vehicles. Also Patrick was a pleasure to work with !"
positive,"Leo is seriously the best. He got us out of quite the pickle today.

It was our last day vacationing in Vegas when the key got stuck in my 2014 Jetta. Couldn't get the car to shut off. Shortly after, my check engine light came on, the transmission was clunking, and I couldn't accelerate past 50mph without the car buzzing and making all sorts of sounds. It looked like we were gonna break down. We knew there was no way we'd make it back to LA. I quickly searched for a mechanic nearby and all the ones in this plaza either wouldn't help us, or gave us some sort of schtick. 

On a last ditch effort, I walked in to Auto Xperts asking if there was anything they could do for us. Leo was courteous, compassionate, and willing to help. He got my car in without an appointment and they started trying to diagnose the issues within 10 minutes of me being there. He also offered us sodas, charging cables, and cut on a movie for us to watch.

He started out by giving me an estimate for the diagnostics and quickly got to work. He and his techs did not do any work without first asking my permission. Leo was honest with me when he said he could not fix the key ignition issue, which I figured. The parts would have to be ordered and he recommended I take it to my dealership to get that fixed because it is still under warranty. 

After they checked my car from top to bottom, they were able to fix my transmission issue in an hour flat and I paid a lot less than what he originally quoted me. Awesome! He then explained everything they did, bit by bit, and even explained some in-depth info on the car's internal computer codes. After a quick test drive, we were good to go, safe to make the 400 mile trip back home. 

Leo never once tried to haggle me and never talked down to me like I was stupid. He treated me and my boyfriend with respect. He runs his business with honesty and integrity, and I would recommend him to any of my friends in a heartbeat."
positive,"I did not know a lot about smogs since previous to coming here, I had never failed a smog.  So when I took my car there and before the diagnostic was done-- my car failed the smog, and I was really upset.  I had no idea that having a check engine light on was an automatic fail.  And my light was on when I smogged the car.  I was upset that the technician did not warn me so I did not waste my money and could return once the light was turned off.  So I called the manager and asked why the guy could not warn me so that I could have saved my money, and he explained that it is against the law for them to coach me.  That the DMV checks by sending people who try to break the law to ensure that the garage is compliant.  That I could call the DMV to verify this.  (And I did; it is true.) However, I explained that I did not understand this and was upset that the money for the smog was wasted when all my car needed was a $15 dollar part.  So the manager agreed that he would let me resmog my car at no extra charge once the car was repaired.  I went in resmogged my car and passed, and it was all done in under 15 minutes.  I gave this location 5 stars, because they went out of their way to make a new customer.  I appreciate that the manager allowed me to resmog my car for free due to my previous lack of knowlege of how smogs work.  I believe that 5 star businesses give you the excellent service you expect.  I believe that some businesses deserve a 6 star rating when they go above and beyond excellent service to earn your business.  So the main point of this review is this: 1) never smog your car with the check engine light on and 2) this is an excellent business with an superb manager.  I gave them 5 stars, but if Yelp allowed a 6th star for extra credit I would.  Great Job! Many thanks, Colleen"
positive,"my engine light was on in my car and someone told me it was my transmission. i looked aamco up on line and even though it was a saturday and they were closed. they let me bring my car in to check it .he told me what was wrong and when i asked if he could do it for me today he did without hesitation!!! they saved me from having to call off work for 2 days!!! very friendly!!! will definitely go to them for any more work for my car and ask for jim to do the work!!! kudos to you jim, april, and aamco!!!! def 5 stars!!! joann"
positive,My Elantra had lots of needed work and I chose Royalty. Had taken my cars there for other minor work and was happy with the service and prices. This time around I needed timing chain water pump and several seals replaced on motor and transmission. After talking to Armondo we nailed down a great price to have all the work completed. That price exceeded a savings of over 20% versus other estimates. My car is now running fine without issues. Beats buying a new car. See you soon with my van.
positive,"First of all I wanted to thank Leo for the respect and service he provided for me and my girlfriend. 

I would highly recommend all my friends, family and anyone who are traveling to Vegas with car problems to Leo. He was honest, fair, and communicated with us the entire time. Here is why:

We came in with something wrong with our transmission, it made funny sounds when we accelerated, buckled when we shifted and our check engine light came on. 

We pulled into this lot full of different types of shops. No one had time for us that day and one shop had real bad reviews. 

 We were greeted by Leo the manager himself. He listened to our situation and told us what he can do for us. Leo said he would try his best to get us back on the road. 

He gave us an estimated quote and said that it would go towards the total cost of the repairs if it came to it. He mentioned that one person was ahead of us and we would be next. Keeping us in the loop. 

Leo also said he would make sure we would know what was going on before doing anything and would want our permission FIRST.

As we waited, Leo offered us sodas, electric outlets, and turned on Amazon video while we waited. The bathroom and waiting room was clean. Leo refilled the water dispenser with bottled water.  

Leo would actually come close, literally sit down on a chair next to us and take the time to listen to us whenever we were making conversation. He always made eye contact with us and informed and explained everything to us about everything. 

We waited for a little over a hour and Leo and his team fixed our problem to where we were able to get back on the road. 

We paid in cash and Leo gave us a receipt. He even wrote down the computer codes that the car gave for our information to keep. Leo never kept anything to himself and communicated everything with us. ""A honest man has nothing to hide or be afraid of.""

His main mission was to get us back on the road and he did. The check engine light was still on but we did not have trouble with the transmission accelerating anymore. No buckling, sounds, or trouble. We could finally go back home!

Luckily our car was covered by warranty and Leo highly suggested we took it back to our dealership. He did not over charge us nor pushed us for more repairs. We could not take it to our dealership due to our time constraint, location from the nearest dealer, and us being tourist. 

Thank you Leo and his team at Auto Xperts."
positive,"The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the poor condition of the vehicle we rented. We had some mechanical problems on the road and the car itself was old and run down. However, they were great at taking care of us, making everything as easy and smooth as possible in getting the car repaired (they arranged everything, told us where to go, and paid for it over the phone). Even the repair shops mentioned how easy they were to work with.
And once we returned they refunded us a nice chunk of our rental fee, for the days lost and general inconvenience. 
We will definitely rent from them again, especially knowing that the model that gave us trouble is being phased out. 
Great concept and nice people. These vans make road tripping so easy."
positive,"Service Department:

I took my car in because the transmission had been slipping in lower gears and I was getting several warning lights on my dashboard.  Most mechanics in the area refused to even look at it, save for the overpriced transmission shops. I was a little wary of taking it to the dealership because they are known for higher labor rates and I didn't want to be solicited by salespeople.

I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only was my transmission issue a cheap fix, but they also noticed a leak in my power steering pump (once again, I was wary at first but they turned out to be right about that, too).

Elisha was extremely helpful.  I dropped off my car on a Friday morning and asked if I could receive updates during the repair.  I let Elisha know that my job is mostly over the phone, so we may have to play phone tag, but she was more than happy to text me the updates.  She also arranged a loaner car that I could drive over the weekend (which was an extremely nice late model Honda CRV).

All in all, it was more expensive than going to a typical auto shop; but the warranties, as well as the convenience, the welcoming atmosphere and the friendliness of all employees was well worth it.

I would consider it a great experience."
positive,"I have been to many many unreliable car shops in the valley and after the reviews and how close Crawfords was to my house I thought I would try it out. I was having problems with my transmission slipping for almost a year. It was not  super noticeable to everyone, but growing up with a father who restored cars and would have me help with with transmissions I knew there was a problem. I would have shop after shop turn me away and say ""we only notice it a little"" or ""I wouldn't worry about it"". I was shocked! My transmission fluid was burnt and I was determined to get to the bottom of this. I had a warranty that other shops said wasn't good anymore...I couldn't read the paper work well and I trusted them. I was about to trade my car in and spent weekend after weekend at dealers. Something wasn't sitting right with me, so I took it here. I told them I had a warranty but wasn't sure on the status. After they did some work they called to tell me the warranty was still good! I did need a new transmission and I needed my drive train replaced. They worked with the warranty company and got me a brand spanking new Acura transmission and the warranty paid for it. I was relieved and knew that I did the right thing by taking it here for one last opinion. It ended up costing about $7,300 something. I would most definitely recommend this shop and will be taking my baby here from now on."
positive,"Great place to great your car or truck worked on. 

I was referred to Ventrice by a friend that has been taking his Lexus there for years. Rocky and his son Greg are outstanding. They specialize in Volkswagens and Audis. 

Ventrice also specializes in diesel engines, transmissions, electronics, bottom and top end engine work as well as drivetrains with VW factory certified training and knowledge. 

In addition to their foreign expertise, Ventrice also services domestic models as well, and is a licensed Pennsylvania inspection station. They even do collision and body work. 

My car needed a complete suspension over haul to pass PA inspection. (springs, upper control arms, ball joints, outer tie rods, front and rear rotors and a front and rear alignment. Greg got all of that done in less than a week! 

If you are looking for reliable, friendly, and personal service Ventrice Auto is your shop."
positive,Took my car transmission rebuilt got it back In two days  very satisfied with the work and did everything they said they would do will return for any future work thanks
positive,"I won't ever take my car anywhere else. Ever since my previous repair shop shut down I asked around with my friends and they mentioned this place. They are extremely fairly priced and won't nickel and dime you for everything. They are also the kind of shop that will tell you if something needs to be replaced that's easy (I.e. air filters) instead of trying to get you to pay a premium for them to do it. Extremely honest shop and great work done! I've gotten my transmission fluid changed, oil changed and tires rotated multiple times and the prices are great. I've also gotten my blinker bulbs replaced twice and this shop was kind enough to do it for free both times, not often that you find a shop honest enough to do that! This is truly the place to go!!"
positive,"Have gone here a few times for an oil change, today went for an oil change and a transmission fluid change.  The guys working here seem to truly enjoy their work, could hear them joking around quite a  bit, which is cool with me as long as they get the job done.  Which they did.  I think happy employees are a good thing!  They got me in and out in about 45 minutes.  I expected to be there an hour.  So that's another bonus.

The prices are a bit highish, but I know that those prices are set by corporate and they have no control over that....so it is what it is."
positive,"Excellent service! This team is amazing. I recently had an oil change completed and am very satisfied. Have done a few mods (APR stage 1, transmission, and cold air intake) for my GTI and trust this team with all my needs.  Looking forward to more and will always bring my GTI here for mods and oil changes."
positive,When my new car needed a new bumper this place was recommended by Avondal Toyota. They replaced my bumper and soon after I was in a rear end collision which brought me back to have my car repaired. The quality of work is excellent and they stand begins their work. Another incident happened when I was caught in a dust storm and my car was damaged so I took it back for the paint and repairs. I have become a frequent customer and truly do appreciate all the hard work and excellent customer service. One benefit of using this body shop is they have rental cars so you don't have to deal with another vendor to rent a car while your car is being repaired. I highly recommend this place for any body work or paint job you need for your vehicle.
positive,"Best muffler shop I've ever been to. Fast, efficient, great price. My 1967 Mustang turned out perfectly. Would highly recommend"
positive,"I'm completely shocked and amazed at the level of service that I just received at this repair shop. Our 04 Jeep Wrangler out of no where was making a lot of clanking noises and was looking what looked like to be oil or possibly transmission fluid. I'm not car saavy whatsoever so I really am at the mercy of mechanic shops when it comes to the recommendations and repairs of my car. I had to have the vehicle to one auto shop in town (Sun Auto off of Stephanie Street in Henderson) upon arriving I waited almost five hours and had to call them to find out what was going on with my Jeep. At first estimate the mechanic Vince stated that my jeep was going to need completely new brakes/rotors in the front, knuckle that holds the steering column, and a brake fluid flush. I requested to not get a flush as I heard that type of thing is completely unnecessary. He didn't like to hear that I didn't want that service and proceeded to tell me that the entire cost of the repair was going to be $667. I couldn't believe that price as I have had bad experiences at other Sun Auto locations. I reached out to my Dad who recommended Bob and Dale over at Specialized Auto Care. He mentioned that when every other shop was giving him the run around and trying to overcharge that they would always give him a straight answer with what was going on with his vehicle. I then had my car towed over to this shop and the tow truck company was over an hour late. Dale stayed an hour and 15 minutes after closing to receive my vehicle, mind you, it was the one rainy day in Vegas. lol 
The next morning at 10 am Dale gave me a ring and let me know that there were a few bolts that had been stripped and they replaced those with one other part. He let me know the noise was gone and everything was working great! Magically, the Jeep was fixed and not for $667... but it only cost less than $200!! I'm still taken aback from the amount of great customer service I have received from Specialized Auto Care (specifically Dale) and am so thankful to not have to spend any more money on a car that we have spent thousands on already. Dale, thank you! You have a longtime customer in me!"
positive,"Mark, Dale and the entire crew at ADS are true professionals. ADS is not the least expensive, in fact, I went to another shop first and had a bad experience (After interviewing multiple shops). Gregs Japanese Auto (STAY AWAY) came highly recommended, after leaving a differential plug loose (leaked fluid all over my garage) and not putting the oil cap back on (LUCKILY, found it after I saw the gear oil on the floor) and drilling a hole in the fuel filter hose (ADS discovered this), I decided NOT to go back. 
Thus, began my experience with ADS. (Found them on the internet, read good reviews.)
I purchased a used 'Seahawk Blue!' 2002 Jeep Wrangler Sport in 2011 because I do not like the crappy new JK (Dodge - BLAH!) engines and wanted to build up a trail rig for Arizona, to my specifications...
Work to date ADS has performed:
- Replaced clutch kit. (Throwout bearing, pilot bearing, resurfaced flywheel.)
- Re geared from 3:73 to 4:88 to accommodate 35"" tires. (A MAJOR job, no problems - runs great now. Mechanic told me I could 'do wheelies' now. LOL.)
- Welded in a new Flowmaster Superflow Delta 40 muffler. (Talked me out of wasting money on a catback system/new catalytic converter. Thank you, actually sounds like a V8 and gets better pick up.)
- Added an electronic locker to the rear Dana 44. Recommended NOT adding to the front 35s, added limited slip instead. (YEAH, EASY BUTTON for tough hills/ruts/rocks!)
- Diagnosed and replaced leak detection pump. (Check engine light wouldn't turn off.)
- Installed aftermarket beefed up (Rubicon Express) upper control arms, adjusted lower control arms and added upper ball joints to adjust camber for alignment.
- Fixed towing electronics Greg's jacked up.
- Installed speedometer calibrator.
- Replaced fuel filter hose. (Greg's drilled a hole into it when doing shoddy work prior.)
- Replaced rear main seal and rear pinion seal.
- Replaced oil pan gasket. 
- Replaced serpentine belt.
While the Jeep's transformation is nearly complete. (Adding body armor, new wheels/tires, lowering body lift...) my Jeep will only go to ADS from now on.
I also recommended a good friend and they fixed up his Infinity G20 - he LOVED the work.
Again, you can probably skimp and pinch pennies and go to another shop, like I did initially. But you could pay for it in shoddy labor, lack confidence on quality of work and if you are doing MAJOR upgrades/projects like re gearing and clutch work, consider ADS. I often take my Jeep off road, I do NOT want to have to worry about breaking down because of crappy work.
I recommend ADS to all my friends, I have NO affiliation with them - but have gotten to know some of the guys over the last couple years and highly recommend them. They are very knowledgeable and spent extra time going over some of my detailed questions...
I know a lot about my Jeep, and double check any recommendations.(Paranoid) In fact, the previous owner left behind paperwork I keep in a file at my house. A couple items were pointed out to her previously and there was a quote - the ADS mechanics made the same recommendations and the quote was actually less. (Consistent, honest - not really impressive they outbid a MOPAR/Jeep shop from Colorado, but honesty and consistency are worth the price.)
ADS gets a rare five stars from me, when my daily driver comes off warranty it will go to ADS too.

positive,"I've been coming here for almost two years now, I had a bad experience at the Pep Boys near by and decided to venture here. They have been doing my oil changes every time I need one, they have fixed radiator hose, and my check engine light came on and they fixed my car for $80 which was a shockingly good deal compared to other research I had looked up prior. Will be back this week for my oil change"
positive,I have been to this shop for a muffler delete and a new muffler thrown on after a month. The shop has not let me down and has done good to my BMW. Very nice seating area along with a clean shop. Will be returning in the future for my exhaust needs.
positive,"I made the mistake of trusting a friend to replace the tranny on my Chevy Silverado. He got a tranny he said was rebuilt, but we could never get the truck working with the new one. So long story short, I spent over $2,000 and a month's worth of time to try letting my friend do it. -- I'm not sure if they just felt bad for me after hearing this story, but advanced transmission gave me a better price to rebuild the tranny than my friend cost me. They finished it within 3 business days, it now works great, and I trust that they'll be there should something go wrong. Was great working with them!"
positive,"After having an issue at another Midas store and wrote a review on Google, I was immediately contacted by the owner of This Midas and was asked to bring my car to the Summerlin (W. Charleston) location to have it looked at and repaired...I went in and was met with the nicest bunch of guys! They took no time getting under the hood and realizing what the issue was and scheduling me for the next day, as they had to order the parts. The owner Bob and the manager Ronnie(sp) went above and beyond to get my car repaired properly. There were a couple of minor issues that made the job time consuming, but the guy ( didn't get his name) working on my car got it done and did a wonderful job! Left my car in great condition ( no grease or dirty hand prints or shoe marks) I will definitely make this my Midas from now on!  Thanks for everything!!! Shawn Cancelli"
positive,"I had a great experience at this location. Sandra took care of me, got an oil change, transmission fluid change, radiator flush, ac service, cabin air filer replacement and overall inspection and fluid check. All good at reasonable prices given the quick service. Even got a discounted car wash. I will be definitely coming back for oil changes."
positive,"I have been coming to this dealership for my service needs since it was located on Hayden 8 years ago.   I recommend Hyundai to all my friends and family.   The service area never does me wrong, no matter if it is for a simple oil change or a check engine light, they are all top notch.  My service advisor for years recently left and so I was recently fortune it to start working with Mike when I had to have my car towed in.   He was amazing, kept me informed on what was happening with my car, and when it would be ready.  Thank you Hyundai and everyone for taking care of me and my car.   Hyundai customer for life!"
positive,"Brought in a Toyota with damage to the muffler, exhaust tip and pipe, in four hours the pipe and exhaust tip are repaired and the muffler had no damage as I had thought. WOW. Honest, fast, economical and it looks brand new. 

Should have reviewed a couple of years ago because Performance Muffler installed a flowmaster exhaust on my 2007 Tundra and I'm really happy with that, even five years later. Can't recommend enough."
positive,"I want to personally thank Ken for helping my husband and I out today. Coulter Nissan has told us multiple times that our car needed a transmission fluid flush. He explained that since our car has a CVT transmission, that it is not necessary and could be costly. He recommended us to AAMCO to have it inspected. We took our previous Sentra here. These guys are the most amazingly honest mechanics I have ever met. We will continue to come here. Highly recommended. 5 stars all the way."
positive,"As a woman I'm always skeptical about having my car repaired, however I was referred to Certified Collision by my insurance company and was pleasantly surprised.  First, the facility looks nothing like what you would expect, it was clean and new.  The manager and staff were professional and the repair that was done looked great.  I will definitely refer this business to my friends and family."
positive,"Because of the heat, my windshield cracked. So I called clear quality auto glass and they came to my house and fixed it. My original window had window tint on it and I was worried that the new window wouldn't match my car, but it came out amazing! They did not only do great on replacing my window but the tint was incredible. It's great to be able to have both my window fixed and get my window tint installed all at once. I definitely recommend as you will not be disappointed!"
positive,"Huge mahalo to army vet Mike M. @ Mello Motive for savn my bacn after my van's rear transmission seal blew out, spun the bushing and dumped trans fluid all over I-10 on the way to Travis AFB from Texas.  He reached out to multiple contacts and found a good used tailpiece and bushing for the trans and had me back on my journey before nightfall. He even worked past closing to wash down my undercarriage and back doors/windows which were coated with leaked fluid and road grime.  What are the chances of getting that type of quality service late on a Friday afternoon!!!  On behalf of J&J Worldwide Services and Travis I commend you for your competent and determined diligence in getting my company's van repaired.  You turned my weekend nightmare into a short delay and are a true credit to the auto repair industry.  God bless!"
positive,"I have bought tires for myself and daughter, had an AC compressor installed, had a side view mirror installed, tail pipe and muffler repairs, front end alignment, bumper repair, windshield replaced and flats repaired at Marco's Detailing.  I have been treated respectfully, always charged truthfully and I trust Marko completely with my car!

positive,"When I moved to Nevada, i searched for a shop that I could trust.  Unfortunately it took me a few years before I discovered Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment Center, and I felt like I was being taken advantage of at the other places.. its been about fifteen years, and I have only taken my cars here. Pete always listens to what i have to say when I am describing the problems, and will ask questions that help him get an understanding of what I an trying to explain. I always feel like he is being truthful with me, and never like he is trying to sell me something that I don't actually need.  I take my cars here, and only here, for everything, not just alignments. Although one time I needed a muffler, and Pete referred me to his favorite muffler shop, but other than that I only go to Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment Center."
positive,"These guys are super transparent when it comes to your car.  If there is an issue, they will show you what they found: for instance, if your transmission fluid needs to be changed, they will show you what color your fluid is versus where it should be.  If your battery needs to be changed, they will show you the test they performed and what your battery measured.  

I have an older car, 85K miles plus, and these guys do keep me informed with what needs to be changed when so I know ahead of time to budget for my next visit.  Luckily I haven't had to get any major repairs done, but this place would be my first stop.  

My only issue with this place is the waiting area.  It could be spruced up a little to make it more comfortable for people waiting for their cars.  I know I'm being nit-picky but I hope the owner will read this."
positive,"So my wife recently ran into trouble with her equinox, she tells me she is going to call her friend/mechanic to have him look at it. (I was worried) Unfortunately he discovers that she needs a new transmission. Out of curiosity I called around for pricing and my God the difference was obvious. Rob was straight up no hidden fees no delays in  availability and he didn't charge her an arm nor a leg. His price was more then reasonable and he was more then honest the whole way through. This is a reliable honest mechanic more importantly trust worthy. I recommend his shop completely."
positive,"I got my truck fixed here and it came back to me looking better than ever! They did an awesome job! Eric was great and kept me informed every step of the way! If you need your car repaired come here, you wont be disappointed!"
positive,"Thanks for being honest and straightforward, guys! They actually recommended that I call the dealership to find out if a repair would be covered under the transmission warranty, before agreeing to go ahead with the repairs. Turns out it's covered, and they saved me couple hundred bucks. :):) Can't beat that service!!"
positive,"This is my second excellent experience with Muffler Masters. They put a factory style muffler back on my Ford Excursion to bring the sound level back to stock.  They gave me some great options, completed the work quickly, and the welds and alignment are perfect. Will be back for more when I need exhaust work!"
positive,"Doesn't even feel like a shop; it's more like a lounge. The staff here are super fast and honest about any issues with your car. I had my transmission flushed, brakes replaced and Busy Buggy is where I have my oil changed every few months. They truly are a quality shop and if you want your car in proper working condition, take ur to Busy Buggy (bonus, the cookies are amazing)."
positive,"If I could give them 6 stars I would! On vacation the check engine flashed on me.  Because I was driving home on a long drive I looked up mechanics on yelp and I trusted the reviews. Got there early at 7am and they took my car in. They have an awesome waiting room with arcade games and a separate room with a TV and couches. They have Wi-Fi which was great because I had to do some work on my laptop. Now as a female I'm always nervous to go to a mechanic but the service was amazing. The check engine light wasn't on when I arrived at Rebel and the car was working. They asked thoughtful questions, checked the car and test drove it twice to make sure. Because they weren't sure about what could be the problem they didn't feel comfortable taking my car apart just to charge me. Wow! Even though they weren't 100 percent sure they gave me some recommendations about what the problem could be and some estimates for when I got home. They told me that if I had the same problem on the road to try a few things. Sure enough their recommendations worked and I got home safely."
positive,"I called about an unknown problem with my daughter's car that our mechanic thought should be looked at by a transmission expert. Aaron told me to bring the car right in and it was checked out and the problem determined within an hour! We had to wait for parts that needed to be special ordered, but we were kept informed of the progress and I felt safe leaving it with them for a few days because of the secure parking area they have onsite. I will absolutely recommend this business to friends."
positive,"Super fast work, removed stock exhaust (muffler and resonators) and replaced with Magnapacks and an X pipe. My Camaro SS finally sounds like a muscle car. Also noticed improved performance because the exhaust isn't being throttled as much. Thanks!!"
positive,"Super friendly and very reasonable. Called another muffler place and they were trying to charge me double the price!  Thanks,  Joe!"
positive,"I gave them a call they gave me all the information and pricing over the phone. Their services was excellent and exceptional. I even also asked them if I could get it done as quickly as possible because I had to leave on the same day to Colorado. They were able to do it. I had ask for a transmission flush & oil change. They told me it might take two hours. So they asked me if I had anyone to take me home and I told them no I'll just take an Uber. The gentleman that was helping me order me a lyft and they paid for it. They also asked me if I need a lyft again to come pick up the car. That was so sweet of them to do. 
They email me the information about my car they did a free check up saying they couldn't do the transmission flush because they didn't have the tools to do it. I told them that was fine and understandable. They were able to do Apple Pay because I lost my credit card. I would recommend this place and will be coming back!"
positive,The reviews are right. You won't find a better muffler shop in the country let alone Las Vegas!  My truck sounds amazing!  Thanks Perfomance Muffler!!!
positive,"I am giving my experience with Josh Bash ***** because of his diligence in making sure my needs were met.I am writing today to express my appreciation for Joshua Bash and the effort he put forth in making sure my needs were met. 
My 2012 Nissan Versa was recently towed to Larry H Miller from my mechanic's shop with transmission trouble. Josh was informative and helpful from the start. He also displayed great patience and understanding when I voiced concerns or frustrations.
Josh went above and beyond my expectations as a Service Advisor. I appreciated his communication, professionalism and willingness to keep pushing for me and my situation. I am very grateful that he was able to help me get the repairs that I needed done at a price I agreed with. I went into the experience frustrated and honestly, distrustful of dealerships. I am pleased to say that this experience has definitely opened my eyes to the fact that not every experience has to be like that."
positive,"I took my Ford F150 to get a muffler installed, Joe the manager and his crew were absolutely very hospitable, professional and very good service, I highly recommend this place they're good people."
positive,As always excellent customer service experience.  Robert was wonderful today and the guys did an excellent job servicing my check engine light.
positive,"I brought my Range Rover Sport in without an appointment on Friday, March 29, 2019 around 5pm because my check engine light came on. Chris C in service went above and beyond my expectations. Long story short. It took 13 days to get my truck back(no appointment, contacting warranty company, ordering parts and lastly a road test). I was kept in the loop as to what was going on at all times. What I appreciated the most is that I was not turned away when I stopped in on a Friday evening with no appointment and given a loaner. Chris C truly exemplifies outstanding customer service."
positive,"Great customer service, Brought my Car in today to see what if they could turn the check engine light off. I had already completed the repair and did not have accept to turn off the light. After about 5 shops. Stamps did not miss a beat. Got there scanner confirmed the codes. Then erased the code and light!! Customer service is harder and harder to find these days!! Thank you Stamps for taking time out of your day to help someone out without trying to make a sale.."
positive,"In auto repair I understand they have point checks and diagnostics.  And so goes the same for customer reviews.  For a business such as auto repair, I think its fair to base the primaries on professional and friendly customer service, quality, pricing, communication, and timing.

Since we first brought our cars into a USA Auto, the customer service at both locations have been highly superb.  This location is more convenient for us and we chose to continue our service here.  It's so convenient that when Matrix died, Corolla was able to nudge it under 10 minutes to this location.  

Most previous repair services I've brought my vehicles into was the entire day's wait.  I expected to wait just as long so planned the day with errands while Matrix was being revived.  It needed an alternator, battery, and transmission service.  I was also expecting to spend almost a thousand $$$.  Far from it!  And on top of that the diagnostic cost was waived since Matrix tested ""flat line"".

We slowly booted Matrix into a parking spot roughly 10:15am on a Saturday morning.  Cody always attentive and walking out to greet while still parking in the lot.  Salena awesome at making sure of service reminders.  Matrix was ready to go home in roughly 3.5 hours.  Dave and his crew - better than excellent!  Matrix engine sounds really good for 159,000 mileage :D

Dropping our vehicles off again for upcoming oil changes.  They raised the bar, I raised a star.  Our vehicles have happily chosen their new care takers!"
positive,"The BEST place to get your car repaired!  BJ Hummel was amazing and great to work with. He kept in contact with me to keep me up to date on what was happening and also when my car was finished.  The final outcome was stunning, it did not look like it did when I brought it in, it looked brand new.   Do not hesitate to use their services!!!"
positive,"Had a check engine light, stopped in and although the shop was busy Mike was clear about the length of time things would take. Due to the vagueness of the check engine light it took quite a bit of time and attention, Mike communicated with me throughout the whole process as to where things were and how it was going. Once they figured out the problem, as with most unplanned car repairs it was more than I could really afford, with some creativity Mike was able to get an acceptable part at a great price making this repair alot easier to stomach. This vehicle is a BMW so price of parts and cost to repair are always over the top expensive. Repairs were made and my car was returned. A day later I was having a similar issue and Mike went over and above to make sure I got the car back to him ASAP. He found a small issue and remedied the problem at no charge, this was a repair that could have fallen on my shoulders but because of Mikes integrity and willingness to do what it takes to not only get a job done but make sure the customer is satisfied. If you are looking for shop I recommend this Meineke."
positive,I'm so happy I switched from San Tan Ford to Berge! I have had so many problems with my car and San Tan Ford just plain sucked! They wouldn't let me have a rental car so I sat for HOURS and waited. Today I took my car in again to have the transmission fixed. Berge fixed it the first time and in general the Focus's transmission is awful so it's not their fault. Today when I brought my car in Tim Drake helped me out and offered to get me set up with a rental car. I was shocked because no one has ever offered me that. I don't need it because I'm using my moms car. They are awesome!!!
positive,"This place was absolutely amazing and very very affordable. I have a 1995 Ford Bronco that two other shops charged me an arm and a leg for, and they still could not fix the leaking of my transmission. These guys diagnosed it for me and gave me a quote that was much less than the other guys who did not even fix it. They were done in half a day and I have not had one drip of oil or transmission fluid on my driveway since. I would recommend these people at any time and they have earned my business for life."
positive,Good price. Professional service. Appointments are carried out at appointed time. No better muffler shop in Vegas.
positive,"Normally I take my van to an area tire chain store for regular vehicle maintenance, i.e. oil changes, tire balancing,  rotation & alignment.  During my last visit, the tech mentioned that because of the age of the van (13 yrs., 108K miles & OE suspension system) that I should consider replacing the shocks and struts.  While I never experienced any excessive bouncing or handling, his comment played in the back of my mind.  Fast forward several months, I started hearing rumblings from my exhaust system.  Having had a favorable experience with Monro earlier in the year fixing the exhaust system on my Toyota, I decided to take my van into them for the muffler and have them check out the suspension system. The manager, Robert Gaiser, assured me that they found no leakage or need to replace any of the suspension parts, but that I needed a new muffler. Not only do I feel that I got a fair price on the muffler, but I felt that I was treated like a valued customer as Mr. Gaiser was very cordial as he took the time to answer all my questions. Job was completed on time as promised.  Would recommend this shop for servicing and car repairs."
positive,"I've read some negative reviews about this shop. Frankly, I'm puzzled. If you own a German Car, most people realize that owning one that is 'out-of-warranty' for a number of years after the warranty has expired; can be quite costly. For those of us who find German cars not only appealing as a means of transportation, but also; as a hobbie - we value long-lasting relationships with competent mechanics and engaged owners of independent car shops.

Short-sighted thinking that after only (1) visit - you should attempt to destroy the reputation of a well-meaning and competent group of automotive engineers just because you didn't receive what you expected - is - well - short sighted.

I have 3 BMWs that are professionally and reliably maintained by Eurowise. I've seen good and bad mechanics arrive and leave Eurowise over the last 3 years that I've done business with them. Frankly - only the good ones are left. If you value long-lasting relationships as it pertains to the cars we love and drive - then I would suggest giving these guys a 2nd and even 3rd chance. After all, a small squabble over a $100 repair bill is nothing - compared to what you'll eventually wind up paying for more significant repairs to your German car over time (like timing-chains, coolant re-seals, transmission repairs etc ...)

Not only are the technicians and management team fair in their pricing - they absolutely stand by their work - no questions asked. And they are a great group of guys on top of their game!

So from a real German car enthusiast to the rest of you - remember - don't sweat the small stuff. These guys are the real McCoy - and I wouldn't trust a dealer to look at or touch any of my vehicles ever again. Talk to Marcel or Mike. They'll make your situation right."
positive,"Price: Unbeatable 
Wait time: Substantial
Work: Not perfect, but for the price it's great. 
The shop is first come, first serve. They open on Saturday 8am-12pm. I arrived at 7:30 and was second in line. My car was not finished until 10am but the crowd in the waiting room passed the time by chatting with one another so it was a pleasant experience. I brought a cat back system and had it installed here, I also asked them to cut the mufflers out and replace them with a straight pipe. I requested that they re-use the stock exhaust hangers and weld the system (which was in pieces) together but not to modify or attach anything permanent to the car itself. The welds aren't superiorly beautiful but they're functional and neat. This shop also does exhaust repair, custom systems, muffler deletes and more."
positive,It's so hard to walk into a place for a service you know nothing about...however my experience with performance muffler was great! The staff are Very helpful and quick to get the job done! Thanks guys for taking care of me!!
positive,"Where to start?  5 STARS!  Would give 6 if I could.  Nice guy with great temperament, easy to talk to, keeps long hours (all day SAT!), knows how to fix things, prices are lower than they should be, no wait, lots of space on the lot.  Can even walk across the street for coffee.

He says he's had the franchise for about a year, so older reviews are not relevant. Very, very pleasant young man, Jon, who knows his stuff.  The older guy also inspires confidence (a we-do-it-right sort of guy).  Other customers look like good company, nice clean shop.

I've had a LOT of great mechanics over the years on Porsches, Benzes, Alfas, Acura, Mazda, Jag...).  Fully confident this Monro can take care of my current 82 Fiat, 93 Alfa, 97 Maxima, 98 Subaru, and 02 Highlander. 
I'm an engineer who likes older cars, so I have to know the good mechanics wherever I live (my last mechanics did race prep for Carroll Shelby on his Austin Healys back in the day, signed photo on the wall).  

Jon's oil change is about $20 cheaper than everyone else, with full filter change and plug-out drip-drain (no gimmicks).  He did calipers, muffler sections, O2 sensors, and differential oil changes for us that were not cheap.  I looked them up:  the internet said the cost could have been 1.5x to 2x what he charged.  This shop doesn't upsell either -- just does what's needed or what's asked for.

Final word?  I'm writing this because I'm disappointed with the guys down the road who asked $3000+ to get the Nissan back on the road (Jon just did it for $541).  Those other guys charged $250 just to look at it, said they sent a video (they didn't, and I didn't ask them to), and the kicker?  Those other guys lost the emissions paperwork I needed to register the car.  Wow.  That's the competition.  This Monro (Dover Center Road, Bay Village) is so much better.

My wife agrees, this Monro is where we'll be doing all our work now, and it's right off Lake Road, très convenient.  We've tried several other shops in the immediate area, but this is EASILY THE BEST."
positive,"Ever since I purchased my cute little red Ford Focus, I had problems with the transmission​ and went to 3 different Ford dealers to fix it. I mentioned this to @Nick Wheeler when I brought my car in for a recall, who not only knew the sound the car made when it acted up, he told me the problem was really with the clutch, and he would fix it for free, as it was under warranty​​. It took a while to get the recall parts and the clutch so Nick got me a free rental and kept me in the loop every day. When I got my car back, it was unrecognizable! It's so much FUN to drive! Lot's of pep and energy. Charges up hills like a chap. I'm just thrilled to be back in love with my car again."
positive,"Thanks for working on my car. Got an engine oil cz, engine coolant flush, and transmission flush."
positive,"I haven't even got my car back (Lexus SC400) and I'm already giving these guys 5 stars.  Instead of ""throwing parts"" at a driveline vibration they put my Lexus uup on the rack, spun the wheels and SHOWED me a U-joint problem and a problem necessitating replacement of the differential.  When I said, ""How much $ for the diagnosis"" the answer....NOTHING!  So now they're installing a replacement diffie for me, rebuilding the drive shaft, and I have no doubt the car will come back smooth and quiet.   Too bad Arrowhead Lexus simply pointed their finger at the transmission mounts as the cause of all the problems."
positive,"I highly recommend Auto Specialists. I was traveling from Las Vegas back to Arizona and my transmission acted up near Boulder City.  My father had just passed away 4 days prior to my leaving, I was still in shock. 
So now the car! I called this establishment and talked with Lee, who made me feel better. She told me that they were going to take care of me and they sure did. Top knot has and compassion too!  The price tag was steep because of the vacuum valve in the transmission BUT well worth it. They really did make me feel better and I recommend them for fast  courteous service.  Thank you Lee!"
positive,"I just moved to Vegas and I found out quickly that there were a lot of shady auto repair shops around here, not to mention I heard a lot of horror stories of people getting ripped off and being told things were fixed when they weren't. H-Tech Auto is NOT one of those shops.

Pete is a great mechanic. He is honest and more than reasonable, and will take you into the garage so you can see any problems with your car. Normally I don't get too many things done at once on my car with a new shop, but I took that risk with H-Tech Auto and I was glad I did. I had the timing belt and water pump replaced (among other things), transmission fluid (and the axle seal), brake pads, etc. done in one sitting. On top of that, he solved my long-term emissions problem. 

Another positive is that they use OEM parts, not the cheap aftermarket parts that are likely to be ineffective. 

I have definitely found my go-to auto shop now. Thank you for saving me money, my car, and being completely trustworthy!"
positive,"I had a great experience at this shop. The expensive Borla exhaust that I brought to them for installation was ""slightly off"" in how it was put together. The tips were uneven to the bumper by about 1/2"". I could hardly tell but the shop manager was extremely detail oriented and would not stand for an imperfect result! I had already gotten my quote for the installation ($80) but he insisted on cutting pipes, aligning the muffler tips, and rewelding the exhaust until it was perfect. He didn't charge me another cent and really made me feel like I was doing him a favor by letting him satisfy his OCD. :-)
Want your exhaust done right? Bring your car here."
positive,"This summer I had the misfortune of speeding along the highway when a pallet fell off a truck and quickly proceeded to damage the front end of my car.  Still drivable, I limped home my 2011, Infiniti G37 and started chatting with my insurance company about the repair.  While they had several recommendations, positive word of mouth led me to USA Collision.  On my first visit to their shop I had the opportunity of meeting with their President, David Robinson and found his straight forward candor and desire to please the customer a refreshing experience.  When I gave him the challenge that if I was going to pay a $1,000 co-pay to my insurance, I not only wanted my car repaired, but I wanted to add some custom flair, he didn't bat an eye.  Throughout the process he helped me add unique touches to my G, as well as kept an eye on my budget and time frame.  The end result was a G37 unlike any on the road, that I am both proud of and confident that it was repaired well.  Thank you USA Collision for your attention to detail and professionalism."
positive,"Just want to say a big thank you to the gentleman who took care of my wife today as well as our 2008 Honda Civic which needed some special treatment to it, i.e. transmission flush as well as fuel injector service and a smog check.​ My wife said the vehicle rides and runs smoother. Our Honda needed it that's for sure.

I briefly​ spoke to you on the phone and you sounded like you knew what you were talking​ about so I o.k.ed the service and also thanks for the deep discount you gave us so now we know where to bring our vehicles in the future. You've convinced me that you're​ my go too for any service that I need. Thanks so much.................

positive,My car was unfortunately hit while parked. Thankfully I had full coverage and my insurance worked directly with abra to get my car repaired quickly. Steve was very professional and kept me updated on the status of my repairs. When I went to go pick up my car Steve greeted me in a timely matter and showed me the repairs done to my car. They even took the time to buff out the headlights (which I've been neglecting) and clean the interior. My car looked better than before it was hit. The repairs are even covered for life. Steve even said that if I had a problem with any of the repairs to contact him and he'll take care of it himself.
positive,"I went into this Firestone because my check engine light was on and I was thinking my oil might be low. I told them about my check engine light and mentioned it might be my oil. I asked if I could purchase a couple quarts to top off my oil if that was the problem. The manager, John, told me to pull my car behind one of the other cars getting worked on and he would have one of his guys see if my oil was the problem for the light. Hunter, was nice enough to see that my oil was low and topped it off for me free of charge. He also cleared my check engine light so I could be on my way. You could see the shop was pretty busy, but they still went out of their way to help me out and they were so kind to do this free of charge. It truly was appreciated and you don't see that very often with car shops. Thank you to John and Hunter and to Firestone on Deer Valley! Acts like this definitely don't go unnoticed!"
positive,"Our check engine light went on after idling in the Arizona heat. Being from out of town, we started calling all Subaru dealerships in the greater Phoenix area and got turned away from all but Subaru Superstore of Surprise.  Brandon W. (Service Advisor) was nice enough to take us at our earliest convenience to run a diagnostic test. Once we arrived, Brandon remembered why we can come in and was ready to check our car. Not only did he provide us with a full explanation of the issue but was kind enough to send us home with the error message and part number for our home dealership. We appreciated the peace of mind Brandon gave us knowing the car was safe for the road trip back home."
positive,After years of great service can't say enough good things about Greg and his  team.  Very fair and very good  Thanks advanced transmission  !! John and Darla B.
positive,"The best thing about coming to Chinatown district for auto repair is that it costs half the price of auto repair services anywhere else in the valley. 

This place is a little difficult to find because it's located behind the Tofu Hut restaurant. It's not very visible from the streets. 

What I like the best about BUSY BUGGY is that they answer questions, and they answer the questions honestly. They don't feed you misleading information like 99% of the other auto repair places do. For example, many of the other auto repair places will say things like: ""You must only use the specific Transmission Fluid that your car's factory produces or your engine will DIE. That's why we gotta charge you more because we can't use a generic brand."" Now everyone who does their own auto repairs at home knows that is bullsh!t. I've been using a generic transmission fluid for the last 90k miles and my car runs like it's new. Here at BB motors, they won't lie to you like they would at the other auto repair shops. 

What makes this place especially great is that they do every kind of repair.  When my  engine light came on while driving to California, I first went to a guy in Orange County(Larry's Auto Repair), and he quoted me at around $4000 to fix it. I drove over here and the guy comes back to me a few minutes later and tells me it was from a previous ""misfire"" and that the car's computer system was merely getting confused and that no repairs were necessary. HOLY SH!T!! Now that's one honest guy!!!! He saved me $4000!!! And he said that even if my engine was having the type of problem that the previous scammer claimed, it would never cost that much. 

I will admit that I hate having to take my car in for an oil change. I'm one of those guys who needs to do it himself. Changing my own oil at home is actually one of my hobbies, and I used to look forward to it every 3 months. But, I recently moved into a community in the Providence district of Las Vegas that provides no garage or space where I can jack up my car and change my oil. So nowadays I have no choice but to bring it in. The pros of bringing my car in to BUSY BUGGY for an oil change is that it actually costs less! If I purchased 4 quarts of Quaker State(the least expensive), and an oil filter, it would come out to around $18.00. Here at BB I think it was like $12.00 for 4.5 quarts of high quality Castrol, oil filter, and they even check your air pressure, rotate you tires, fill your wiper fluid, check all fluid levels, and check your air filter, all for free. That's a great deal!

Customer service is great. It's like being at one of those 1950's full service garages from the old movies. The workers are all dressed nice and clean, and everything in the shop is so well organized. I've never seen such a spotless garage before. 

I can't believe how fast they get your car onto the lift. At all the other auto repair shops, they let your car sit in the parking lot for a while, and then some extremely obese guy covered in motor oil, waddles out to your car all lethargically. Usually it takes him about 5 minutes just to walk from the entrance of the garage to your car. Here at BB, the moment you drop your car off, they sprint out, jump in, and jack it up for repairs. It literally looks like those Nascar maintenance guys working on your car.  

5-Stars and my favorite Auto Repair shop in the world."
positive,"Took my 2002 Jeep Wrangler there for issues I had related to passing smog and a check engine light.  From the time Shlomi took my initial call until my service was complete, everything went smooth.  Shlomi is honest man, easy to talk to and very knowledgeable. 

I recommend him highly!"
positive,"Made an appointment after perusing YELP reviews for local muffler shops.  Was surprised to see a ""not so nice"" YELP review of a repair shop that I had used in the past, so decided to try Monro after reading their reviews.  The exhaust pipe from my catalytic converter to my muffler had broken. As a former weekend mechanic, I got under the car to examine. I knew that all I needed was a piece of pipe spliced between the two pipes. After leaving the car at the shop, was wondering whether they'd call and try to ""talk me"" into a new exhaust system...well, they didn't!  Picked the car up and paid what they had quoted;  I'm now driving around and once again able to hear my radio  - thanks Monro!"
positive,"No one likes needing to get their car fixed. It's even less fun when your car is new.

A coyote ruined my day unexpectedly (I guess I ruined his day too...) and caused what looked like superficial damage to my one-year-old CRV. Inconvenient, but no big deal. I'm pretty new to the area and no one had any shop recommendations for me, so I scoured Google and Yelp and kept seeing great reviews for Orlando. I checked out their website and I was sold (really, go check it out!).

These guys know their stuff, and they're thorough. What seemed like a fairly minor accident ended up being pretty major - the coyote hit a lot of parts on his way out. A lot of them were only damaged a little bit, but Orlando found ALL the damage, and replaced Every. Single. Part. I also got updates from them along the way explaining what needed fixing and what the ETA would be.

Not only was everyone so nice, and not only does the work come with a warranty, but they washed and did a basic detail on my car. All my dog's nose smudges were cleaned off the windows (don't worry, she's replaced most of them already!) and all the dust and dog fur wiped and vacuumed. In and out it was cleaned with care, when the dealer doesn't even bother to run it through the wash when I go in for service.

At every interaction I felt like they cared about me, my car, and the quality and detail put into their work. This is how a small business stands out from the crowd. I hope I never have to get my car repaired again, but if I do, this is where I will go."
positive,"I was referred to this place because my regular mechanic couldn't figure out what was wrong. Every time I took off from a stop my car didn't want to get in gear. It would take a couple times of pressing the gas pedal then jump into gear. I was expecting a huge bill. However, the mechanic found three wires that needed to be replaced and I paid under $100. My car is running great now. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. This is the place to go for transmission issues."
positive,We've taken our vehicle here for some check engine light issues. Staff here is hard working and honest. They do their best to locate the issue and fix it. I'll definitely comeback. Pricing is decent too.
positive,"When one of our company vehicles started having transmission problems, I thought they would immediately tell us we needed a new transmission.  Not only is that expensive, but our money making vehicle would be down for a couple days.  To my surprise they recommended flushing first because they didn't want to jump to conclusions.  Not only did the flush work, my guy and truck was back on the road within an hour (I didn't even make an appointment) saving me thousands.  After the flush, they checked back with me & the driver to make sure everything was running smoothly, who does that, no one expect Advanced."
positive,"We were in an accident recently and needed to get our car repaired 
I looked up car repair shops in our area and found Chaneys
Today we came to pick up our car and I have to say, it looks like a brand new car 
Chaneys was very good about keeping us updated with everything 
I highly recommend it 
Hopefully We won't need to use them again but if we did, it would definitely be Chaneys"
positive,"On my way from California to Vegas my car stalled and lost acceleration. I pulled over and noticed the check engine light and that there was minimal oil. We kept driving in hopes and prayers going 25- 60 mph with the gas pedal all the way down. When we finally got to Vegas and let the car cool the following morning we checked the oil and it had the bare minimum. I had an oil change from Kia the prior week so I was baffled as to why there was no oil. 

I called Busy Buggy and spoke to Marco inquiring about a knock sensor because I had received a P1326 code and also let him know there was no oil in the car. He recommended we put oil in the car and to bring it over. So we did. 

Thankfully I did not need a sensor but only an oil change and he removed the check engine light. I'm still baffled as to where my oil went because he showed me that there were no leaks and the oil was not burning. 

I still had  about 2k miles to go for a new oil change. I'm not sure if the oil change was necessary or if he could of just removed the check engine light and I could of just added more oil. 

Marco is really nice and he did help but.... he also tried to get me to buy more from him. 

He stated I needed a new air filter which I bought.

And he also said my back breaks were ""metal to metal"" and If I wanted to get them done it would be $270ish. I told him no he said they had a guarantee of 12,000 miles. (I don't even live in Vegas and it doesn't make sense to me as to why I would drive to another state to get my breaks done after 12k) Also I just had them checked the week prior and was told they were good by Kia and which I went to Kia again after I got back home and told them that I was told my breaks were metal to metal. Kia stated they were ""not"" metal to metal and they were 6/32 and new are 10's. 

I will give both of them the benefit of the doubt. 

I was charged $50 to have my car looked at for leaks which I did not argue.. I did not have time.. although when I was on the phone I wish I would of been told about the charge when he said ""Come on in! We will check it out."" 

He also keeps the lobby and restroom clean and stocked. 

Overall I'm just glad my car was taken care of and good to go back on the road!"
positive,Ken and Bo found why my check engine light would not shut off after the replace the O2 sensor twice the found 4 broken wires and if I would of left it that way it could of took out my computer. They save me some money and they do a great job every time I bring a vehicle in.
positive,"Quick service, honored the workmanship warranty.

Our car was overheating when the A/C was turned on, our extended warranty works with Meineke, so we brought it here to get check. They found the issue and was able to replace the part the same day, used our warranty coverage and we left just paying a small deductible and sales tax.

Car worked great for a few days and it was overheating with the check engine light. So we had to tow it back to this location. They were busy and said it would be a bit, but we understood. Soon after we left, thinking it might need to stay overnight, they called us back within the hour. Said it was a loose connection with the part new part. Had it reinstalled and tightened, we could go back to pick it up anytime before closing.

Although there was a mishap in their installation the first time, in which they apologized for. they didn't try to up sell anything or tag on additional issues that needed fixing. It was an honest replace, repair, warranty honored!"
positive,"Called when I had an issue with my car they got me in that day and out in an hour and twenty minutes. They even checked my ac for free and checked my transmission after being told by another shop there was a leak. Customer service was fantastic and I never once felt as if I was pressured or talked down too. This will be my go to place when my car needs anything done. Friendly staff, great service give them a shot if you car needs a checkup."
positive,"Had my car repaired at Caliber and I couldn't be more happy with the work. Lindsay took great care of me. She made sure I was aware of the process the whole time and when I got my car back it was earlier than I was told it would be. I have dealt with collision centers in the past and the experience was not very pleasant. I am pleased to know that they are not all the same. I will never have any of my vehicles repaired anywhere else. If you are looking for a reliable, trustworthy place that knows what they are doing this is it. Go in and see Lindsay, you won't be disappointed."
positive,"Had my car inspected, 4 new tires and oil change. Quick, friendly and reasonably priced service. The updates done to the shop really make the building stand out and adapt to the new renovations of East Liberty. Highly recommend this Aamco location to anyone looking to get their car worked on, right! Not just a transmission shop! I will be putting the word out about the great service here."
positive,"My youngest daughter is in the US Army stationed out of state. She has a car but it's here in AZ and an older one so she wanted something new with a warranty. After a lot of research, she decided she wanted a Hyundai Kona. I called several dealerships to find the color and options she wanted, however none of the dealerships had exactly what she wanted.  We made an open appointment with Kevin and showed up Saturday.  Kevin introduced us to DJ who handled the salesman duties for us.  We drove two different models to see which engine/transmission combo she wanted. She picked the 1.6 Turbo that only comes in the Limited/Ultimate trim level. Kevin, DJ and the team worked hard to get us the financing and price that fit our daughter's budget. It took a little longer than they had anticipated so Kevin bought us supper that evening.  Our overall experience at Earnhardt Hyundai was a pleasant one and we definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an honest deal. Thanks!"
positive,Took my car transmission rebuilt got it back In two days  very satisfied with the work and did everything they said they would do will return for any future work thanks
positive,"When one goes looking for a low priced used car, one likely will find a dealer like Gasparr.  Recently I went looking for a used low price auto that I wanted for just sports like fishing and bicycling.  I came across Gasparr and decide to check it out despite poor reviews,  I met the manager and he showed me a few. The one car I knew about from an ad was not to my liking and I asked him what else he might have.  The manager was knowledgeable and there was absolutely no pressure.   He never tried to tell me the cars were gone over by mechanics and cleaned up like at the uptown dealers. This is to be expected at such places.   I suspect the bad reviews came from people who did not fully understand the place in the market such small low price dealers occupy.   So he showed me a great car, blemish free, new tires and (relatively) low mileage. He said  that to cover his concern that since it was 10 years old something might break he would pay for a warranty policy to cover major iitems for 3 months. Seemed more than fair.   I paid cash so I do not know about financing. But a few days later the quality of Gasparr was put to the test.   I began to have problems with the transmission. I called to explain and without a moment's hesitation the manager said to bring it back - he'll fix it.  I drove the car back and within a few days he fixed it no extra charge!   Another test came a few days later when the transmission gave me a second problem. Called again and once again without hesitation - and in a matter of hours - HE SENT A TOW TRUCK TO BRING THE CAR BACK FOR THE TRANSMISSION ADJUSTMENT.  This time the car was fixed in one day.   Look, it is an older car, full of old car surprises. Gasparr could have stuck me with it, He did not. He made it right without a hassle of any kind!   He far exceeded any expectation I had about how a small low priced car dealer would behave.   Could not be happier with my new old car."
positive,"My son, who is only in Arizona for school, took his car into All Pro Transmission because the transmission was acting funny. Jim said the wiring harness had been chewed by vermin, which caused the transmission to fail so needed to find the problem and fix it before driving it. My son knew before he left for school there was wiring issues. Jim had several mechanics/experts look at it and try to find solutions without the expense of a new wiring harness, with no luck. It took almost 30 days for this process, including the time it took to replace the transmission.  He then recommended Louie at Meet Your Mechanic. Louie found the problem quickly and was able to resolve the issue at a reasonable cost. Jim tried to resolve the matter in his shop, i only wish he would have recommended Louis/Meet Your Mechanic sooner. So far no issues and my son has been driving it for a few weeks. Jim was gracious to incur the expenses these others had charged, and also towed the car for my son to Louis' shop. Thank you for that, Jim! The cost of the transmission was fair and reasonable. I felt Jim was honest, caring and very much wanted to save us from more financial burden."
positive,"I went to Dave's Auto Service on Pflaum Road, Madison , Wi. Service advisor informed me to go online and register on Yelp.Com. To get a 20 percent discount on my service. GREAT advice saved 24 dollars on change transmission fluid. Each time that is applied great info. Free Wi fi , beverage and TV."
positive,"Just left with a 6.2l Yukob sounding like a v8 is supposed to. Did a highway run at 75mph.  The Magnaflow they recommended put the perfect amount of growl into wide open throttle with little to no noticeable drone at low rpm in 4 or 8 cylinder mode. This is the 4th or 7th time in 20 years these guys listened to what I asked for and nailed on the first go. 

Need muffler/exhaust work?  Go here everytime. 

Update:  did a 2800 mile trip and no issues with the tone. Quiet cabin, until you mat it. Then, yep, the appropriate amount of get-out-of-the-way growl."
positive,"I was in an accident where in my car was struck from behind by another vehicle. I took my vehicle to a Nationwide blue ribbon repair shop in my area. A month later they called to let me know my vehicle was repaired. I took my car to Pack Brothers in Belmont for a vehicle repair inspection. Long story short, Pack brothers discovered that my car had not been repaired at all...just covered up. They determined that my ""repaired"" car was not safe to drive. With help from Pack Brothers and Collision Safety Consultants, Nationwide insurance and their blue ribbon repair shop was forced to correct the problem. Had it not been for these fine folks, I'd probably still be fighting to get my vehicle fixed. I live a couple hundred miles away from Pack Brothers, but this is where I'll take my next damaged vehicle. Don't be strong armed by an insurance company who isn't interested in your satisfaction. According to NC state law, where you get your car repaired in YOUR choice. My choice from this day forward is Pack Brothers."
positive,"Best service... PERIOD...

I knew I needed a new transmission and Advanced Transmission was my 3rd call to get info... As soon as the phone was answered by Denise I had a good feeling about their business... She sent me to Bill... Not only did he ask all the correct questions he was able to answer all my questions... He explained there were 3 main choices for a new transmission... After a few minutes he didn't try and upsell me... He told me the most expensive would be more than I needed... Recommended the middle choice and it was over $800 less than the other 2 calls... At that point I was confident this was the place... Bill put me at ease about spending a good chunk of money... Greg also is top notch with knowledge and customer service... Their technitions went above and beyond what I expected... There was another underlaying problem and was able to trouble shoot it with no cost... They did the other repair and I checked other places out if curiosity... Saved another $200... Do not... I repeat DO NOT HESITATE going with Advanced Transmissions... From outstanding customer service to the outstanding workmanship... Thank you Denise, Bill and Greg... Along with all their technicians"
positive,"Recently brought my Tacoma in for an inspection after seeing leakage around the transmission oil pan during a recent oil change.  I also asked for a tire rotation.  They emailed me a complete inspection report/findings w/ pictures.  The inspection and tire rotation was free.  I then scheduled to have the tranny oil pan seal replaced a couple days later.  No hassles here, no up selling on things that don't need to be done.  I'll definitely be coming back here."
positive,I have found my new mechanic!!! I highly recommend Shlomi and his team here at A B-Z Auto.  I dropped my car off  at 8:15 with a failed SMOG and a check engine light on. Shlomi took me right in and he was done by 1:30! He went above and beyond to take care of me AND sent me on my way with my passing Smog ! And then called me the next day to ask how my car was running.  Thank you for the excellent service!  Oh! And did I mention how nice and clean the waiting area is?! WOW!!!! I will send all I know to A B-Z Auto! !!
positive,"I've had exhaust work done at other muffler shops it's been poorly welded and exhaust leaks within the first month :(.  So I decided to come to performance muffler by people's ratings on here and on Google and they are right, excellent  quality, and inexpensive work love the dual muffler setup on my 1993 Chevy 454ss. Thanks Joe, job well done my wife is really happy with her truck and the way it sounds really brought are truck to life.  star rating from us both.  keep up the good work. I will be referring a bunch of friends that are working on projects and are asking about a good muffler shop."
positive,"Excellent Service!

I brought my Land Rover here for transmission issues. Terry was at the desk and was super friendly. I am always apprehensive about new shops as we all usually worry about having people charge and charge us for everything and all the auto repair stereotypes. 

I found Huff to have given me honest advice and they quickly ascertained what the issues were and called me to give me options. 

A rare shop that gave good service!"
positive,Went to Dimaggio's with what seemed to be a loose muffler making a clunking sound. Dimaggio's took care of the problem quickly and fixed what was a loose hanging clamp. I was amazed that they did this and said there would be no charge for the repair. I will certainly take my vehicle to Dimaggio's for all future service.
positive,"Busy buggy. Been coming here for about 3 years. It's started with a simple oil change 3 years ago, came in and was greeted and offered cookies and beverages. Been coming here for small things ever since. But not until Thursday of last week was I fully thankful. Took my wife's car in. Turns out it was the transmission. Go figure. 2011 chevy equinox with less than 100k miles. They took about a week, waiting for the dealership to deliver etc. Finally picked it up today and I am glad I brought it here. Honest hard working owner and team. Will continue to come here as long as I'm treated fairly as I have for the past 3 years. Thanx busy buggy car is running like the first time I took it out of the dealership and wife is extremely happy. Owner Hamid I think that's his name is an honest guy from what I've come to know of him. Will continue to come here and send u more of my friends."
positive,"Took my car here to get some damaged repaired and from the first call I made to set up an appointment, to picking up my vehicle the staff there made it super easy. Dennis was amazing, he answered all of my questions and explained everything and he was really nice and listened to all of my concerns. The repairs were done quickly and my car was ready when they said it would be. I would definitely return here if I ever have a need to get a car repaired again."
positive,"Rotary Evolution is a highly skilled, very knowledgeable engine builder and mechanic.  I've owned several RX-7's (2nd and 3rd generation) and kept only two.  One is a low mileage well-maintained, unmodified street machine.  And the other is a track car repaired by Ben, the owner of Rotary Evolution.

As many in the RX-7 community can appreciate, these cars are aging homes to various gremlins that can be difficult to troubleshoot and diagnose.  My car had a phantom fuel issue for several years.  I spent two years taking it to various Mazda / rotary shops in the Bay Area, to no avail.  Many hours and literally $thousands had been thrown at the problem with absolutely no results.  I was ready to give up and ditch the car, but the online rotary community came to the rescue and recommended the services of Rotary Evolution.  Basically, I told Ben, ""I don't care how long you have it, what you do, or how long it takes.  Just let me know when it's done."" Ben literally spent a hundred hours over the following months tinkering with the car and finally sorted out the problem using some unorthodox procedures.

They charged a very reasonable rate and I couldn't have been happier with the result.  As I continued making modifications and improvements, I hired Rotary Evolution for two dyno tuning sessions.  With a properly designed exhaust and ignition + fuel map corrections, Ben was able to raise its power output by +33 hp at the wheels, which is pretty good for a naturally aspirated 13B.

The engine itself was rebuilt by Rotary Evolution for the car's previous two owners.  Ben was very forthcoming in describing some of the limitations that were holding it back from making the power that it should, and suggested further modifications for a future rebuild.  I recently sent him a set of rotor housing to resurface.  Upon receipt, he reminded me that, for track purposes, they need exhaust port modification, and offered to do it for a good price.

If I ever again come across an unsolvable problem with any rotary-powered car, I'd be willing to ship or make the drive to Las Vegas and hand it over to Rotary Evolution.

Las Vegas is lucky to have a world-class engine builder that knows RX-7's inside and out!"
positive,"I came here for the first time to get my oil changed. 
Marco came to me afterwards and let me know my starter was having issues & then quoted me for what that would cost to fix it.

I took it in the next day to get the service done & they told me it should only take an hour. Well...they had my car for 8 hours that day and didn't tell me what was going on with it. (This is the only thing I wasn't happy about) 
When I came to pick up the car, Marco told me they thought the issue had to do with my transmission control module & there was a code coming up on my car to get it fixed by ford as it was a recall. 
Marco promised me that if I took it to Ford and they told me it had nothing to do with my starter- that he would refund me.

Well, long story short- that's exactly what happened. Thank you to Marco who made sure I didn't get ripped off or have to pay extra money for something that was never broken on my car. I really appreciated his willingness to take ownership of the mis-diagnosis & for being so transparent at the end. 

He has my trust & I will come here for future work for sure!"
positive,We have been bringing our Mercedes S550 and our Range Rover Sport here since we moved to Arizona about 4 years ago. They have been more than fair and always a help to me and my wife even when I am out of town for months at a time. They always give us their full attention every time even if it's just for the check engine light being on. We are always confident that when we drop our cars off that it always comes back running like a champ. Thank you for all that you guys do for us.
positive,"Mike saved me from an imminent meltdown tonight. 

My cars transmission blew. I left my car at the auto shop, but forgot to take my house key off the ring. I get home after the shop is closed. I have a 4 year old with me. 

I look up locksmiths nearby and get ahold of mike. I kid you not, he was at my house five minutes later and got me and my kid back inside. 

He is professional, friendly, and incredibly fast. If I ever am this stupid again, I'll definitely know who to call."
positive,Such friendly people I had my transmission redone and they were very friendly and answered all my questions and even when I came in with my front bumper dangling a bit off they fixed my bumper when I didnt even mention it I was so happy and thanked them for my new transmission and for my bumper fix..thank you guys I appriciate it so much..
positive,Rebel has THE BEST customer service! My check engine light turned on and my registration was due in a few days. the guys at Rebel are so awesome they took my car in to get smogged for me the same day my registration was due because they knew they were going to need to keep my car to run the proper test to turn it back over to me. They called me to let me know I can go online and pay my registration before it was due before 5pm to avoid any late fees. thank you so much rebel automotive you make having to take a car into a mechanic a lot less stressful!!!!!
positive,"I have been using Advanced Transmissions for over 10 years -- my family and business, and they have always provided A+ service. My first major experience was about 10 years ago. The Honda dealership quoted $4,200 to fix my transmission and Advanced Transmissions did it for $2,200, and it worked great. This morning, I called them to fix my daughter's starter. They arranged for the tow and the car was completed by 1:00 pm. Their quick service sure made my day go much easier. The owner Greg has always been super helpful to me over the years."
positive,"I am always slightly skeptical about a business who has 5/5 Stars. Especially with so many reviews. How can this be?! Well, after witnessing the service level at T & M I can say that I get it now. 

I was set to drive from Las Vegas to Denver, CO but the week prior my check engine light came on. I checked my gas cap, opened the hood of my car to pretend like I knew what to look for. I did it all. I called around and the only place who could run a diagnostic was this place. Thankfully nothing was wrong but I was so impressed with their kindness that I made an appointment to get my oil changed the day I was leaving town. 

They were so nice and remembered me. While I waited they made small talk with me in the lobby and were calling customers to remind them about oil changes or parts updates. They knew almost everyone by name that came in. It was impressive. 

My oil change was under $60 and they were quick (with an appointment). I'm sure hearing from any repair shop that you're going to have to form over a bunch of money for a repair isn't fun but I'd rather hear it from and support a place I trust."
positive,"I've had 3 of my cars here for an exhaust work and every single one has been a great experience.  I have been to other muffler shops in the past and these guys do a better job with the overall work, customer service and professional conduct.  They really also warranty their work which is may not be the case elsewhere.  The owner is always around and ensures you're happy with the final product."
positive,"A+ work, honest and friendly. Far less expensive than any dealer!

If you have a VW or Audi, don't take it anywhere else. The owner, Derek has a love for all things VW and Audi and knows every detail from basic maintenance to building full boosted race cars. He has personally maintained my Audi TT and easily drafted up the plans for a full turbo build. Derek knows how to maintain the DSG transmissions, Haldex Quattro units and everything else quirky about the brand. If only I could bring all my vehicles to him!

Personal suggestion is to not call or email Exklusiv as they are always busy buried in car work. Just show up!"
positive,"What an amazing experience! I went there to have them test and print up why my check engine light was on. While I was there I thought might as well check my battery. Damian went above and beyond by not only checking my battery once but a couple times to make sure it was holding a charge, turns out it wasn't. He replaced it and printed out what was wrong with my car (it needed coolant). Thanks Damian! I will always go back here!!"
positive,"I had a great experience when I bought my car last year.  The salesman was friendly and helpful (as he should be when I spend that kind of dough on a car).  I was smart enough to get my trade in appraised by Car Max FIRST, before going to the Audi dealership.  Since they know that Car Max will honor that value for 7 days, Audi had to honor it as well, if they wanted to sell me a car.  They ended up giving me a little extra.  Let me say that, thank goodness the remainder of the warranty was included in the price, because I ended up having some major issues with the car (a 2008 A4 Turbo) about 3 months after I bought it.

I took the car into the service department, and they were unable to find anything wrong with it.  They suggested I just get the oil changed, which I did.  After a weekend road trip to San Diego, the car was barely running, so I had to take it back in.  Nancy and Brett were both really helpful, and I understand that the situation was not their fault.  They did all they could do.  However, the mechanics could not figure out what was causing the issue.  They started out by replacing some fuel pumps.  That didn't solve the problem.  Then they replaced the transmission.  Still no luck.  Finally, they brought in a specialist from Germany and ended up replacing the entire engine.  That fixed it, but they had my car for over a month.  Luckily, I was cruising around in a sweet loaner 2012 Q5 while they had my car.  It is just a bit disappointing that I had such major issues with a car I purchased just a few months prior.  They still never figured out what the problem was, but it is all fixed.  Recently, I have replaced my battery and scheduled some maintenance (for 35k miles), and Brice, who is the service manager, has been awesome.  The service department is very busy (can't help but think it's because they might sell lemons like they did to me, but whatever), so if you will require a loaner car, you need to make advance arrangements.

It may sound strange, but I work for a luxury hotel, and verbiage is very important to us.  That being said, I really think that the receptionists need to work on their verbiage.  Sometimes when I call, I feel like they are bothered by having to assist me. They aren't always so friendly, which is unfortunate for the cost of the product they are selling.

Service on Audis is VERY expensive in general.  If you are considering buying one of these vehicles, I would suggest the Audi Care package - otherwise you will be paying an arm and a leg anytime your car requires an oil change or scheduled maintenance.  I wish that I would have bought this option, but it was not offered to me when I purchased my car.

Overall, I think that you get personalized service (which is expected), and they do not just treat you like a ""number.""  I can't imagine buying anything other than an Audi in the future, even though I may not have had the best experience this time around."
positive,"My truck is at 100k miles and has never broke down.  My window motor recently died in two different windows, two separate months, I figured 100k miles is time for a checkup. They looked my car up and down, they let me know what needs to be replaced and what can wait. Turns out I needed shocks and hub bearings.  Some other parts were worn but not warranting replacement yet.  So i had them fix it, had my truck back the same day, now i go to them for oil changes too because honest mechanics are hard to find, but once you find one you will never go anywhere else. 

On a side note, a friend of mine thought she had a bad transmission, she brought her car here, turns out it was just a timing issue. So instead of forking out over 1000 bucks for a new transmission she ended up with a bill for around 50 dollars in labor. 

That being said, this place values the relationship they build with the community over the almighty dollar.

That being said, I'll be back for oil changes and preventive maintenance on my current car, my wife's current car and every other car we buy in the future. Because good honest mechanics are hard to come by."
positive,"I like Tim Walter so much, I almost wish my car would break down so I would have an excuse to see him. 

He is super honest, explains everything, gets the cheapest appropriate parts he can, and isn't the least bit condescending. Picture the kindest surgeon you can; Tim Walter is the same, just for cars instead. 

Also, the man has a great memory. He *still* makes fun of me for that Coke can I had strapped to my muffler 7 years ago."
positive,"My oil change and transmission drain/fill turnout to be cheaper then independent shop, and i got a free carwash and vacuum!  I'll be back!"
positive,"Found the truck online and called them on Labor Day. Went and saw the truck the next day. Met them and loved how down to earth, honest and welcoming all of them were, especially Kathleen. Walked out with a 15 day/500 mile warranty on transmission and engine. Day 7, mile 410, transmission clutch was slipping. Called them up, and true to their word they got me into a transmission shop and had the clutch replaced under their warranty. A persons word goes a long way with me and they honored theirs. I will definitely recommend anyone I know to buy from them and will check them out first when it's time to buy my wife a new car."
positive,"The manager and mechanics are kind, honest people who provide phenomenal service. I went in to have my muffler and center pipe replaced due to rusting issues. 

They saved me $600 over the dealership service quote, had the required parts delivered within the hour, and finished the maintenance itself in about an hour.  

I felt entirely comfortable trusting my car to them, and plan to have all of my future servicing done here."
positive,"Being a huge car guy, I thought I would try out Scottsdale Muffler.  Called, made an appointment to get a muffler that I bought installed on my Jaguar S Type R.  I showed up on time, and in a few minutes they took my car around.  Then they called me out to show me that it wouldn't fit.  I really liked that, because rather than give me some story, they showed me the issue and explained it thoroughly.

Fast forward a few weeks.  I buy the correct muffler, make an appointment, show up, and they take the car around on time.  A few minutes later I hear them working on the car.  In an hour, they were done.  Top notch welding, no BS, and they didn't mine working on my luxury car, all while respecting my time and busy schedule.  Very reasonable labor rate too.

I will be back in the future and highly recommended!!!"
positive,"I've been in for two services now, and these guys are top notch!  My 40K transmission service was about half the price the dealer wanted and also half the price of my former mechanic!  The price I was quoted on the phone with just the general inquiry was the same price I was quoted once I arrived, and that was the final price.  There was no upselling like you typically get with some mechanics.  

The reception area is neat and clean and modern, with USB and a place to plug in your laptop.  Very important to me, because I like to wait for my car and work on my laptop.  I was offered coffee/water/soda and taken back to the Keurig for fresh coffee.  

Let me say, I dread using public bathrooms, but they have separate men's and women's restrooms, and it was spotless!  The atmosphere is very family-like.  Eddie and Moe are super nice guys who seem to really like what they do, and they answered all of my questions thoroughly.  I like the fact that they have the two dogs too!

Another thing that pleasantly surprised me is a mechanic who is actually intuitive and reset the service alert without me mentioning it.  It appeared in between my transmission service and subsequent oil change.  I forgot to ask them if they could reset that.  Lo and behold, I get in the car...no annoying service alert!  It's something small but shows me that they are observant to more than just the service at hand and are looking at the big picture.

I will be coming back here for anything I need in the future for my VW GLI!  Definitely recommend CARS!"
positive,"I shopped around a bit for the check engine light I had on that was related to an evap system leak.  The other shop wanted $96 for the diagnostic alone. Pep boys charged me $45 for the diagnostic and when they'd found the issue they called me up and asked if I wanted it repaired.  Since I did get it repaired they rolled that $45 charge into the payment for the repair.  They gave me a quote over the phone and when I went to pick up the vehicle the actual charge was $4 less.  Its not a whole lot of a difference, but at least it was in my favor.

I found the customer service here to be especially good.  All of the staff was very friendly.  There was sometimes a wait for service but nothing out of the ordinary for an auto parts store or an auto service shop."
positive,Purrfect Auto has exceeded my expectations! Truly standing by their warranty with ace mechanics this place receives my most sincere recommendations. I had a check engine light that was very difficult to figure out but Purrfect auto worked to find the problem and made sure the issue was resolved. Thank you Purrfect Auto!
positive,"I brought my van to Scottsdale Muffler & Automotive at the recommendation of my very knowledgeable mechanic; he knows who is good  and who isn't!

I talked to Chris on the phone and told him my mechanic was recommending a catalytic converter for my van to help me pass the state emissions inspection. He asked me a couple of questions and let me know that they could have my van done in about 45 minutes and quoted me a price, which was less than half of any other shops I contacted!

However, I like to do as much of my own vehicle maintenance as I can, so I looked into what it would take to replace my own catalytic converter. Turns out, I would actually have to spend about $100 MORE to do the work myself!!!

I quickly called and set up an appointment!

While waiting in the lobby, the mechanic working on my van came in and said he needed to show me something (oh no, here we go!).

He showed me that my muffler had a pretty large crack in it. He offered to replace the muffler with a new one for $115, which I thought was a very fair price for my vehicle. I asked if the crack was causing any performance problems and he said no. I then asked if the crack could be welded and if the muffler would work ok with this fix. He said yes, and offered to do this repair for only $30! 

Here's the really cool thing: he could have easily told me that my performance would suffer if I didn't buy a new muffler. And I would have believed him. I know quite a bit about cars, but not everything. I was ready to go ahead with the new muffler if he said I needed it. But he was HONEST and let me know that a simple and inexpensive weld would take care of things.

As a small business owner myself, I really appreciate it when other businesses treat me well. I am happy to say that the folks over at Scottsdale Muffler & Automotive will have all of my future business!"
positive,We had a outstanding experience with Zain Engineer the service Manager. He went above and beyond to help us concerning warranty issues and transmission issues. He was extremely professional and helped to guide us with any questions we had. Highly recommend talking to Zain for any service issues you have at  Nissan AutoNation.
positive,"Scott and his crew have been beyond helpful to me during the last 9 months that I have used them.  Whether it is helping me find the right battery for my truck or doing a bumper to bumper inspection of a used car I bought they have always been accommodating and able to fit me in whether it's a scheduled appointment or an emergency.

Recently they were able to change out the 12v battery on my hybrid after I picked it up from next door and getting accident damage repaired.  During the course of the repair the battery died and they were able to get me in and help me change it out.  Normally I would do it myself but I was 7 months pregnant, recently in an accident, and couldn't lift the battery.  They even checked my check engine light for me but unfortunately it spit out some weird code even they couldn't figure out.

All in all Whitey's has been around since before I was born and has continues to be at the top of their game.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in the area.  I don't mind driving from central Phoenix to have someone I trust work on my car."
positive,Awesome experience. They got me in right away on a Saturday and gave me a fair price for a new muffler. The only place I'll go for exhaust work.
positive,"I dropped of my Audi A3 for 35k service, 2 days prior a check engine light came on which i paid no attention to. The drop off was smooth everyone at the dealership was friendly, there were people ahead of me but didn't wait long at all. Then the shuttle service took me to work. I think 2-3 hours later i got a call from my service advisor saying that the check engine light was on and it was caused by a high pressure fuel pump that was about to fail. The good news was warranty covers all the parts/labor needed, the bad news the part was not available and will come in the following day. I was little disappointed about that since i needed a vehicle to get around, which they offered me a loaner vehicle, i was able to get back to the dealership get my loaner car without any hassle. Got my car the following day, the service advisor explained everything that was done to the car, what parts may potentially need replacing. 

I just want to say what a great service Audi of Henderson provides. Audi makes quality products already but part of great car ownership and brand loyalty is the quality and honesty of the brands ""service departments"". Service departments are who customers deal with the most post purchase. The car buying process takes about 5-6hrs or so and the relationship between the sales person and buyer may continue or end with no consequence, but after buying a car you need to have a good honest, quality service department for its up keep for years to come. I really think that this is one of the most important aspects of car ownership. I hope Audi of Henderson keep their high quality standards in customer/car care. Audi Of America keep setting high standards for your car dealership/service departments, keep policing those that don't perform well."
positive,"This has got to be THE most HONEST MECHANIC I have ever been to.  Not only is it convenient (right at the corner of Bloor and Bathurst, with key drop option available), but they are ridiculously honest I'm actually in disbelief as I type this review.  The people who work there are super friendly too, they never make you feel stupid and as a woman with a truck I'm weary people will take advantage of me or talk down to me, but that never happens here.  The customer service is amazing and the people make you feel like family.   My experiences here have been as follows:

- First time I came here was because I felt like my alignment was off the night before a trip to Montreal - I needed to get the alignment and hopefully an oil change done first thing on a Friday morning cuz I had to be on the road to Mtl. by noon.  I used to go to Canadian Tire but they were unable to accommodate me for a morning appointment the next day because they said it takes several hours to do an alignment.  Feeling more desperate,  I called Midas as a last resort because I (wrongly) ass-u-med they'd be kinda expensive - but it turns out their cost for an alignment was actually CHEAPER than Canadian Tire and they were able to see me first thing the next morning!  On top of that, their website has coupons for $ off any work and oil change deals so #protip: make sure to check out the Midas website and grab your coupons before you go.  I dropped the truck off at 9am and by 10am I got a phone call from them - ""Truck is ready to be picked up, your alignment was fine, we have a printout of the specs to show you, so we didn't need to do the work after all, we did do the oil change, come on down and get your truck!""   My jaw literally dropped to the floor.  A MECHANIC TELLING ME THE WORK WASN'T NECESSARY, not charging me a dime, in the heart of downtown Toronto?  THIS IS UNHEARD OF.  Needless to say, I made it on the road in time, confident with my alignment, with the extra $ I had set aside to spend on the alignment still in my pocket to splurge on my trip!  Not only that, they did an ENTIRE vehicle inspection checkup/spec/printout sheet to show me free of charge when I went to pick up my truck.  Midas won me over as a customer right then and there. Canadian Tire who? lol 

-Second time I came here was cuz my muffler was making a rattling noise on acceleration. I got my brother to help me isolate the noise before calling the garage so we knew that it was coming from the exhaust system.   I was reluctant to bring my truck in anywhere cuz I was afraid of how much even just a diagnostic/estimate would cost me.  It turns out Midas at Bloor/Bathurst does the inspection and estimates for free!!!  Brought my vehicle in before work, and by 11am they were on the phone with me to let me know the ""damage"" - turns out it was just a loose clip.  They replaced it for FREE.  They told me that the vehicle was fixed and ready to be picked up, and everything looks great and I owe them NOTHING.  I was sitting here prepared to spend in the ballpark of $1000 for repairs and it turns out I owe $0.00.  If I could have hugged the guy through the phone I would have. 

Just also note it seems like I'm bringing my vehicle for all these unnecessary repairs - no.  I am not a rich woman so when I bring my truck to the garage it's cuz I'm trying to avoid MORE costly repairs in the future (i.e. having to buy new tires for driving w/ the alignment off for too long, and not just ignoring a noisy exhaust/muffler issue).  I'm not some nitpicky person when it comes to my truck - it's got lots of untreated cosmetic damage from when my mom backed into me (lol) and a crack along the bottom windshield from a pebble hitting the windshield during a bad storm -  but I do like to address preventable driveability issues before they get worse. This mechanic is so honest it's actually ridiculous and they are so friendly and nice I feel like finding them was akin to having a horseshoe up my A$$. PRICES ARE ENTIRELY REASONABLE - cheaper than Canadian Tire and service is way more personalized -  Please go to this garage, they are amazing!!!!"
positive,"I took my 2014 Nissan Altima here for the first time after the car had a complete transmission failure after a drive from Orange County.  This was an unexpected issue as the car is relatively new and has low miles. I was in Vegas on vacation, not to have the transmission replaced. However, I cannot say enough good things about Auto Nation Nissan, specifically the service associate Mike,100% professional.  His professionalism and service is top notch.  He was very empathetic to my situation and reassured me that the car was under warranty and reassured me that it would be fixed expeditiously. I am 100% pleased with my service experience here and appreciate Mike for keeping me up to date on the details and for going above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you Mike I hope the dealership realizes you are an asset to the team."
positive,"I just cant say enough about these guys.  I took my car in yesterday for an oil change and my check engine light was also on.  They changed my oil no problem and my engine light was on because I needed a new gas cap.  I was SOO relieved.  These guys are totally honest AND reliable.  These are the kind of guys that I KNOW if and when I need them to do a big job, I'm not going to have to call around to price the job with other competitors, these guys are the BEST!  My boss has been using them for years and that is how I found out about them.  I am divorced so I don't have anyone to work on my Jeep but now I have these guys.  They can never close up shop because I don't know what I will do.  I don't want to go to ANYONE ELSE.  They also put on my registration sticker on my plate because I didn't have the tool to get off the license plate cover.  They are just GOOD GUYS.  Thank you Al!"
positive,"This is the second vehicle that I have taken to Chris at Scottsdale muffler, and they did a spectacular job and my catalytic converter for my diesel passed with flying colors. Thanks again guys"
positive,"I've been coming here for the past few years and its always a good experience. They are compassionate and kind, always looking for the best way to help. I'm very sensitive to being talked down to and have never felt disrespected here. They've always taken the time to explain the work to me. Recently took my car in for a check engine and a broken muffler pipe. They fixed my check engine light issue but they could only replace my muffler and not fix it. Instead of just quoting me the price, they directed me to someone who could fix my issue (instead of replacing) it for half the cost. They also didn't tell me what to do but gave me all my options. Always will take my car here."
positive,"I was referred to Ultimate Collision through the insurance company of the person who rear-ended me so I was hoping to get my car repaired quickly and wasn't expecting a lot of personal attention.  Despite the fact that I wasn't paying for the repair, Dennis and the rest of the team provided a great experience. The repair timeline was clearly explained and I was constantly kept in the loop on the progress. Dennis was also nice enough to inspect and buff out an existing scrape I had (not related to the accident) at no charge. My car was repaired quickly and looks great. I highly recommend Dennis and team and will definitely look them up the next time I'm in need of a body shop."
positive,"I had an excellent experience with all three of my visits to Choice Transmission. Dennis completed 3 projects for my on my old truck, and none of them were related to transmission work. They really are a complete automotive shop. I highly recommend their services."
positive,I had an brake booster issue with my EDGE.  I contacted Santan and they said they couldn't get me in for at least a week.  I called them again later that day and spoke with Jesus.  Jesus insisted I bring it in the next morning and assured me he would get the EDGE in that day.  He agreed that there is no reason I should have to wait so long for a serious brake issue.  I met Jesus (with the beard) that next morning.  This guy was professional and kept me updated through the process (4 phone calls) also they found out there was another issues with my vehicle due to a check engine light being on.  The booster was covered on an extended warranty and the additional work was at a very reasonable cost.  I just wanted my vehicle to be handed back to me the way it was prior to the mechanical issues.  I am so please with the work done and as well as the experience I had dealing with this dealership. More importantly I'm happy that Jesus took the time to listen to my concerns and worked to resolve them.  This is how all customers should be treated.  Thanks again to Jesus and the Santan team for all your hard work.  You have earned my business.
positive,"I've been looking for a good shop to service my truck that I use for my pool maintenance company. I bought it about 10 months ago and it's been a challenge finding a shop that really looks over everything when you get the oil change. Last time I got the oil change at a shop I won't mention I asked them to please look over everything because the truck is new to me and I want to keep it running and do any necessary maintenance to prevent issues down the road. Came back to pick it up and asked the tec how it all looked and he said great ! And nothing was needed. I was super happy because we're pretty tight on money like most people and if I didn't have to spend any more it was a good day ! Leaving the shop I noticed the low pressure light for the tires was on so I stopped by the tire shop  that was on the corner and I had a nail in 2 of my tires. So needless to say they didn't really check over everything. 
So speed up to this week, it was time for a oil change and noticed my brakes where sounding really bad so I knew I needed to get it in soon. Every time I came to a stop the sound got worse and worse so now I'm afraid to drive the truck so I parked it. I talked to my wife who is the finance manager at our house about what was going on and we weren't in a position to drop a grand on breaks and rotors plus a oil change so she had to figure out something because this is my tuck I make a living with. She noticed that Sears had a auto center down the road and we have a Sears credit card so we took that as a sign. I brought my 2007 Chevy 2500 truck into the shop and as soon as I walked in the door I was greeted by a nice guy that asked me what he could help with. I explained that I needed a oil change and my brakes where sounding bad so if they could check that out as well and if they could just do a general inspection on the truck for any other issues. By this time a couple of the guys from the back came out and asked me some more questions about what I was hearing do they could trouble shoot the problems better. I wish I had the young man's name that diagnosed my truck because he was super courteous and very professional. We left the truck there to go eat dinner and within two hours received a phone call from the shop explaining the issues that needed to be completed on the truck. They explained that the truck needed rear pads and rotors the differential fluid needed to be changed and the transmission fluid needed to be flushed. They gave me the pricing on all those repairs and they were actually cheaper then two other shops that I called just for the brakes. This was the best experience I've ever had at any auto shop and will highly recommend Sears at superstition Springs to all of my customers friends and family. I really hope that Sears reads these reviews and they find out the name of the young man that did the work on my truck and give him a raise he definitely has a bright future in the auto industry and he turned me into a Sears auto center customer for life."
positive,"Service Advisor Ricky Clark was the best. We had a check engine light for Throttle Body on the Sentra. Ricky initially quoted us the same price as other dealers but went above and beyond to win our business. Ricky was able to find other avenues and help reduce the price of a replacement throttle body for our Sentra. After service was completed and time of customer pick up, Ricky was still able yo reduce overall price with other discounts! Vehicle works flawlessly now and Service Advisor kept working with customer with pricing! Excellent Service Department and Advisor! Thanks you again"
positive,"So my paid off Kia Sedona started clicking and the check engine light came on right after a trip to ""Jiffy Lube"" I suspected it was bad news but I didnt anticipate how bad the news would be. I checked google maps because I saw that All Foreign and Domestic Auto Service was in my neighborhood and they just did some renovations to make the place look great. The reviews were what I needed to see. Ive been to other West Park places and well. I had new brakes that squealed too at low speed. Anyhow took it to All Foreign and Domestic. It turns out my engine tick was a bad bearing on a piston rod. There is something comforting about someone delivering bad news with an Italian accent. This was on a Wednesday. He quoted me a price for a used engine that was about the same low miles as mine. I did the math on a new car or a lightly used car and decided Id fix the engine.  He told me it would be there on Friday and the job would be done late tuesday. On Friday night he called me to come down to see the new engine in the frame getting ready to be installed. I went up of course. Totally amazing seeing this major surgery on the car. On monday at around 5pm I got a call ""Your car is ready to pick up"" (Yes, that was a day early) So they did a full engine swap out in two days. I waited two days where I have driven 300 miles to write a review but things are working perfectly. The engine is so quiet I cant even hear it. Also the rumbling I heard in my suspension was some heat shield (So that is silent and WAS NOT a huge suspension fix) Also my brake job squeal was diagnosed as cheap brakepads and that was fixed as well. My car is back, it is in perfect shape and was WELL taken care of by All Foreign and Domestic. Oh yes and the quoted price in the beginning was SPOT on at the end. No surprises and what I consider a very reasonable price for basically giving my whole car a major overhaul."
positive,"The crew at Jiffy Lube definitely saved the day! In this case it was moving day!
My room mate and I just barely made it to Jiffy Lube in the hopes that they could fill our transmission fluid since it had been draining fast for some reason or another. Not only did they offer to fill it for us for free either way, but when they saw how bad the leak was, not only did they fill our transmission, but they gave us two spare jugs of transmission fluid so that we could make it home. Not only THAT, but they also gave us directions to take the safer back roads across town, considering the condition of our car.  Saying that they saved the day is putting it lightly. I will always recommend the crew at Jiffy Lube. Thanks a bunch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"Good place with quality work. They squeezed me in on a Saturday early afternoon with no appointment, welded up a muffler and got me back on the road in under 30 minutes. Ill be going back to get our Jeep's exhaust done."
positive,This is a nice local shop. They got our car in quickly when it had a check engine light. They determined it just needed an oil change. They got the job done quick and their prices are fair. They even gave my daughter a lollipop when we went to pick it up.
positive,"I WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE NOW THAT I'VE BEEN HERE!!! What else can I say about these guys but their shop is one of a kind. Fast, efficient, friendly, helpful, and definitely are NOT there to rip off their customers.

I had some work done by a previous mechanic at another shop and was having some check engine light issues after the work was performed. Looked these guys up on Yelp and thought I'd give them a try after seeing the great reviews. 

Spoke with Tamra who was extremely nice and got me in as soon as she could. When I first got there I was greeted by the owner Phil. I let him know of my problem and he ran a free Diagnostics check (which by the way I've never heard of any shop doing). After some searching he found out that my spark plug wires were bad, all of which I was told by the pre-mentioned previous mechanic were replaced. He gave me an absolutely fair estimate but knowing a little bit about cars I decided to change them myself. He told me good luck and sent me on my way, did not try and upsell anything to me (which as you know with auto shops is quite rare). Upon replacing the spark plug wires, one of them was so bad it fell apart when tugging on it. Needless to say got those replaced but the check engine light issue still remained. Called up Litchfield Auto and again Tamra squeezed me in ASAP. 

Got there the second time and Phil and his mechanics again started a free Diagnostics on the car, mind you they closed at 6pm and I showed up about 4pm. Upon further inspection, he told me that the spark plug wires were crossed and fixed them, handed me my keys, again at no charge and told me have a great day. I couldn't believe the great service at this point so I MYSELF asked him to charge me a labor fee for these guys working on my car for hours between both of the days I took it there. 

Long story short these guys are EXCELLENT. I have never been to a shop that is this clean and that is actually concerned about retaining loyal customers and not just how much money they can squeeze out of you. Like I said before I know a little bit about cars and Phil and his staff are one of a kind. He took the time to talk with me about the issues and explain how things work with the car so we could be on the same page and never did I once feel like he was out to get me.

I will DEFINITELY recommend this shop to anyone I know and will go there for all my auto needs.

Thanks again guys for being there for the customer!!!!"
positive,"I came here for a state safety inspection. They were able to fit me in the same day without an appointment, which was nice because I was working from home with a cold that day, so it was convenient.

The shop office is a little dated with floor to ceiling wood paneling - but in some weird way, I really liked it. All over were posted old photographs of family, friends, etc, and I could tell there were a lot of memories and history in this place.

The inspection went fine, they didn't try to sell anything unnecessary to me, and I was given the same price I was told. Unfortunately, no experience actually getting my car repaired here, but based on this experience, I'd be happy to give them a try."
positive,"There is new owner. Very honest.   I sat waiting for my oil change.  The 2 people that were waiting both had issues with there cars.  One was an AC compressor that was starting to go and another was a muffler issues.  They filled the guys AC with freon for free and said he could probably make to the cooler months and deal with it later.  The muffler guy he said was fine for emissions and it was only cosmetic noise issue and see him when it starts to bother him.

I got my simple oil change as usually.  No air filter upsell like in those other places.

New owner is doing a great job."
positive,"These guys just earned my business today. Drove in because my check engine light was on they did a quick check on my vehicle and it was only a ""gas cap"" issue.. no charge and I was on the road in less than 15 minutes!! Thank You!"
positive,"If you want honesty, transparency, and expertise bundled up with a tiny bow on top, Whitey's is your new spot.  

It sucks getting your car fixed.  It sucks even more to have to find someone you can trust.  They live up to their reputation big time.  It's hard to not give them a review when you leave so here I am.

My throw out bearing on my 2013 Mazda 3 went out and I had no clue what it was.  Tarrance hopped in the car and knew the problem within a second of starting it.

He kept me in the loop the whole time and gave it to me straight when he uncovered the real problems inside the transmission.  It could've been doctored up the wrong way easily, but he took his time and made sure everything was done correctly.  He told me what was going on and in the end it was my choice how I wanted to go about it.  

My car shifts smooth as butter now.  Thank you Tarrance and everyone at Whitey's!"
positive,I have taken two cars here for transmission repair and both times was very happy with the price and repair.  I called them for a referral for a non-transmission problem and they said I could bring my car by their shop as they did expanded work beyond just transmissions.  They resolved problems two other shops overcharged for and did not fix.  Very honest guys here!
positive,"We were thrilled with the work at Red Mountain Collision.  Dealt with Jessica and Bob and both were a pleasure.  Jessica kept us well informed throughout the process.  Bob wrote the original estimate and with the exception of my muffler which also had to be replaced due to the accident, the estimate was spot on.  
I was able to schedule my repairs while I was out of town.  When the car was going to take an additional 2 days Jessica had the rental car all set up for me first thing on the morning of my return. 
Not only does my car look great, the day I picked it up not only was it detailed on the outside it was meticulously detailed on the inside. I had told my husband it didn't look that good on the inside the day we picked it up from the dealership.  
Do yourself a favor if you need body work done, go straight to Red Mountain Collision."
positive,"I cannot say enough good things about my experience at National Transmission. I had brought my BMW to the dealership, who told me that I needed a new transmission and that this would cost me $7300. Wanting a second opinion, I take my car to Brock. He determined that it was a computer/sensor issue, not a transmission problem. He explained the problem to me in detail. Following up with BMW, I took it up to the Shop Foreman, who later admitted that they were wrong. Brock went above and beyond to recommend a better place to take my BMW to get this issue fixed and even set up an appointment. THANKS BROCK!"
positive,"Was treated like a king when I went into service for a check up and got a very honest answers and they got me out of there quickly. I got a transmission update and a steering check and left satisfied! The whole service crew seemed like really nice people, the guy that helped me is named Josh and he did a great job! I'll definitely be back and recommend Infiniti on Camelback and plus on top of that they gave my car a free wash couldn't be much happier!Service Department rocks!"
positive,"There are blessings in this world that come in various shapes and sizes.  For my friend, Kathy N., it came in the way of Ralph and Frank at Pro Collision Center.  Without going into too much detail, Kathy got into an accident and had to get the car fixed.  Everybody's got problems, so I won't go into a sob story of Kathy's particular hardships, but she was admitted to the hospital via the ER with chest pain.  With financial constraints, medical issues, and as a struggling newly-divorced, single mom, she's had much to contend with.  The day of her hospital release--today, in fact, she rushed to return the car insurance rental and to retrieve her car at PCC.  With the stress and problems that my girlfriend was facing, (I believe) it was Ralph that came in his invisible superhero cape to facilitate the return of her vehicle and the settling of her insurance case.  HE KNOWS WHAT HE DID, and God bless him for it.  Trust me, word of mouth goes far.  Ralph went above and beyond normal customer service.  

Go to these guys!!!!  There's a certain basic knowledge of cars that all auto repair places will have, but will they be fair with you?  Will they work with you?  Will they take care of you?   A good, fair, and honest woman went in looking to settle her insurance claim and get her car repaired.  She could have easily been taken advantage of, and nobody at PCC needed to invest themselves the way Ralph/Frank did in her.  They didn't owe Kathy that at all; they invested themselves in her because they cared.  A good deed is never forgotten, and please consider this anecdote as you all peruse through yelp reviews on where to go for your auto repair needs.

As a close girlfriend to Kathy, all I could do was cry and join in her blessings for the exceptional service rendered and peace of mind given to my dear friend.  Of course, I'm writing this review second-hand, because Kathy doesn't have the access to do so, and I would never doubt her word.  Please don't doubt it either.

May this review serve as good karma for this place of business."
positive,"I wanted a fuel-friendly car and selected a cross-over type car. Very pleased. Mark definitely gets his role...No pressure and lots of laid back confidence. I would have preferred a manual transmission, but I'm more than pleased​ with my purchase."
positive,This place answered the phone on New Years Eve at night when nobody else did.  On top of that they are honest and could have easily told me I needed a new transmission but after a quick look all I needed was an axle.  I left my car with them for a week because I live in Phoenix and I was anxious about leaving my car in a different city but their clear communication with me made it easy. They are trustworthy. They even stayed up late when I picked up the car because I flew in from Phoenix at 11PM.  All of that and they didn't even charge extra even though it was NYE and they are mobile.  Thanks again for being there.
positive,"We travel Full time in our RV and tow our older Jeep Liberty.  Our previous neighborhood mechanic recommended we go to a Jeep dealer to get our transmission serviced and we decided, since we were in Death Valley are that Las vegas was close.  We originally called a different dealer to be told it would be a week before they could get us in.  We called Chapman based upon other reviews.  we were not disappointed. They gave us 3 options for times.  We chose one then the day before they called to confirm.  We asked directions which she provided.  
We arrived early and were immediately greeted by Anthony, our service advisor who listened patiently as we outlined our needs and issues.  He gave us a price and estimated time frame.  Offered us a place to sit with Wifi.  It all worked out as we hoped.  Repairs made, vehicle transmission serviced and LOF performed.  We left very happy and would go again."
positive,"Matt was a pleasure to work with for a muffler repair on a work van.
Got me in quick. Price was outstanding. I will take all muffler repairs for my fleet to this location.
Thank you for the outstanding service."
positive,"I had taken my 2001 Ford F 250 into Dave's a few months ago to find an oil leak that once i pulled into their driveway decided to stop leaking. Dave's crew gave it their all but couldn't find it and told me to keep an eye on it and let them know if it came back. Well when the leak came back so did I !! And they found it this time. It wasn't a ""cheap"" repair but due to the complexity of the leak and the work involved in doing the repair i can say ""I'M A HAPPY CUSTOMER!!"" 
I have now passed Dave's name on to my mother who is in need of transmission service and who I'm sure will test his patience but I know in my heart she WILL be well cared for. 
Thank you Dave!! and I will send you a few more family members if you think you can deal with them :0)"
positive,"Big Jim's is great. I took my car there for a transmission repair last year (after the guy at the dealership tried to be super sketchy and offered to do an under-the-table deal where he wanted to get a used transmission off the internet to replace mine) and it's still working great, plus it's under a 2 year warranty. The best part was that Jim took out a big transmission book, flipped to the page with my model of car, and showed me the exact parts that were broken. A nice change from most mechanics that list off a bunch of mumbo-jumbo technical terms with no real explanation. I really appreciated the simplified explanation of what was broken on my car. The repair was expensive, but... transmission repairs are expensive.  Then a few days ago I took my car to Jim for a brakes repair, after going to a different mechanic (I had wrongly assumed Jim only did transmissions) that quoted me a ridiculous price and was clearly trying to rip me off. Jim quoted me a price $300 less than the other place and explained that the other place was going overboard, and my car simply needed new brake pads & discs. He finished the repair very quickly and so far everything is working great with my brakes. Overall Jim seems like an honest guy who is great at explaining why your car needs certain repairs... and he doesn't try to rip you off with unnecessary repairs."
positive,"After another visit to Calanni's, I was impressed once again. Firestone had charged over $800 for a piston servo seal bore fix that wasn't even done and wasn't even done properly as well as leaving transmission lines leaking after befing towed to a TRANSMISSION SHOP THEY USE!! (A small claims against Firestone is being filed). They made promises that weren't kept with a rental car and had an attitude that a franchise controlled the market. Charlie Calanni and his team came to the rescue for the best price once again. I DON'T TRUST ANYONE ELSE BESIDES CALANNI""S COMPLETE AUTO REPAIR SERVICE, PERIOD! You know what you are getting when you go to Calanni's, quality, safety, price, knowledge and trustworthiness. If you are new to Lakewood or a well-rooted Lakewood resident, trust your vehicle to Calanni's. 

Don't believe the negative reviews that people don't show their faces. If they actually had an argument they'd show their faces."
positive,"This review is for the service dept - service from Karla G. I have had terrible experience with this dealership in the sales department, and would NEVER recommend buying a car from here. 

I recently price shopped transmission fluid exchange for my 2006 Honda Element, and I was surprised that the dealer was competitively priced with independent shops. Concerned about the shops using the wrong fluid type or similar transmission issues, and that I had two outstanding recall items, I took my vehicle to Honda West with an appointment. The service from Karla was great, informative, and spot on. My car was serviced and completed prior to my estimated completion times. 

My only concern that I need to address is that they advertise on their signage when you pull up $39 Synthetic Oil change, but I noticed my service tag was for 3K miles with standard oil."
positive,"My entire exhaust pipe, from my muffler back to my catalytic converter, was missing.  The screw things (flanges?) had rusted at both ends as well! 

I couldn't afford a whole new exhaust system, at $1,500!

Hot Rod Scott was able to replace the portion of the pipe that was missing, and weld it at either end directly, without having to replace the flanges (assuming that's the correct term!) For $300....score!

The price was great and it should last me 5 years, since I don't drive that much.

They were very quick too.  Less than an hour!

They also do custom and performance muffler systems, and a lot of repair shops send clients here for exhaust and muffler work!

I highly recommend these guys!  Thanks for saving me $1,200!  SERIOUSLY."
positive,"This is a brand new Auto Repair Shop, I think it used to be called something else, but it's brand new owners and the staff here is WONDERFUL!!

We first got an oil change here a few months ago - $11.99 for your basic oil. WOW.

We came back to get our brakes done. I had received a quote from Pep Boys for $500 which included brake pads and new rotors for the back. Here they did it all for $300 and threw in an oil change with the synthetic oil. BARGAIN! And it only took an hour for everything.

We also have a check engine light on for a problem with one of the engine fans. They first ran a full diagnostic which is $49.99, free if you do the repair there. They were able to get the check engine light to come off, but in a re-cycle of the car's engine the light came back on; they felt so bad they didn't actually end up charging us for the diagnostic after all. They even called around to junk yards to try to find us a used part, but no luck. We are going to have to have the entire fan replaced, but we'll definitely be doing it here. The staff is so nice, they are honest and have the best pricing in town. I give them 5 stars all the way!"
positive,"Chris (service) was very nice. After driving my 2012 nissan altima from socal it overheated and caused major problems with the transmission. I called Nissan praying they could help me since my car was still under warranty (friday) I spoke with Chris who was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. They processed me in and out in 20 min maybe less, giving me a rental until they could figure out the problem. He called me to let me know they had to replace my transmission. I am really grateful they were able to do all of this in 24 hrs and the total level of service and professionalism from their staff. Good Job!!!"
positive,"CARS did work on our Jetta in the past and everything always went smoothly. More recently they did a quick repair (computer for the transmission) on our Porsche 911. The car wouldn't go into gear right after we had it detailed for sale. Someone was coming to look at it in a few days which put us in a bind. CARS diagnosed the problem, ordered the part, made the fix and got us up and running in time for the car inspection. We remain friends with buyer and he has had zero problems after the fact.

We will take our BMW M3 (see the German trend?) there when it needs work...although we hope that doesn't happen soon."
positive,"Just like everyone else, I was drawn to this place because of their cheap prices. It took me a while to find the place because Apple Maps directed me to Fort Apace and Peace Way. I called the shop and Marlene has been very helpful in giving me the exact location (behind Arby's on northeast side of Fort Apache and Tropicana). 

After getting my car checked, it turns out I needed more than just an oil change to get done. Chris took the time to explain what needs to be done with my car (transmission fluid, power steering fluid and coolant flush). Due to those, my oil change which is supposed to be $25 (5W20) came out free. They also offer free oil change or 10% off when you write a yelp review and it's good for use that same day :) 

Even though I came out paying for more than I was expecting, I am satisfied with the customer service, the prices and the short wait time. I definitely recommend this place and I am coming back for my next oil change."
positive,Wow! I will definitely be coming to this shop for all my car service needs! I drove around from shop to shop and everyone wanted to charge me $50-$100 to see why my check engine light was on after describing to them what was happening with my car. I went to USA and spent 10 seconds describing it to Chris. He said without doubt it was just my battery and the best part is he didn't charge me to do a 5 second test to make sure he was correct! I couldn't believe everyone else wanted to charge me almost $100 to tell me I needed a new battery! Chris and his staff were amazing and had 5 star service. It's a relief to be able to fix your car without the hassle! I will be back!!
positive,"These guys made my VW Eos fun to drive again. Had insane problems ( check engine light on, speedometer glitches, fuel tank showing empty when full, sudden gear shifts, etc.) which I had deducted were a problem with my ABS module. As of the time of writing this review I've driven to Cali and back. Mostly drove around for the heck of it, about 14 hours total... Drove right to California with my top down to ""test"" the work done. Wow. I cannot describe how great these guys will treat you. Eddie took me into garage and showed me all the gorgeous vehicles there. It was a cargasm. I was quoted an absurd price by the VW dealership and was almost ready to give up my beautiful little car. But, damn; these guys reminded me why I love my car so much. I would recommend going here if you love your car, and want to save money on the maintenance it deserves. I cannot wait to come back to get my dash system put in. I'm coming back Eddie and Moe!"
positive,"I just went to Tim as my check engine light came on on my recently purchased 2005 Toyota Corolla. Tim took a look at the code and told me what the problem was. Reset it for me and told me to call him if it comes on again, all free of charge in just 5 minutes. That is why I like Tim and will recommend him over anyone else, especially for old cars, the guy is very honest and will only recommend what is best for your car and your situation. Not making you spend money when you don't need to."
positive,"I could not be more satisfied with Pete's.  Unfortunately, my '06 Exploder had a serious transmission issue.  At first I thought that the needed repair was related to an insurance claim from a few months back.  While the needed repair / rebuild was not related to the previous claim, Pete's Transmission came HIGHY recommended by the repair shop and my insurance company.  While I was given the opportunity to have my vehicle towed to my own shop of choice - I took the recommendation.  

The repair was completed as planned.  My telephone calls asking for updates and follow up of the repairs and improvements were addressed with details and patience as I have just about ZERO knowledge of transmissions!"
positive,"Never had a problem with servicing my car here. Been here about 6 times for numerous things. I had my check engine light on and I pulled it up to the service bay. The guy came out and hooked something up to it really quick and told me that it's just cheap gas that had a high oxygen level. They didn't charge me and I was in and out in 5 min. My oil changes had no issues and when my tranny went out, they fixed it the next day and paid for the towing.  The tranny was under warranty but it still nice that I didn't come out of pocket for a thing."
positive,There is a reason I'm loyal to VW. And this dealership solidifies my commitment to staying with VW. I drove up today from LA and found that my check engine light went on. They were swamped but took me in to look over the car. Within 2 hours I was out of there with enough fluids and understanding that the car would make it back to LA ok. The professional way I was treated from start to finish was outstanding. Jeffrey was the service manager who not only went out of his way to fit us in but also was a joy to deal with.
positive,"Went in today for a smog, ended up getting a oil change, then got the transmission flushed of 121000 miles of nasty fluild. The 2 workers were so helpful, curious and I left with a smile because Jimmy and Alex being so helpful and caring about my issues with my car. I will be back the next and every time my car needs anything that they can take care of. I have never had a better experience having to do with my car and that means alot. Thanks guys you are the best!!"
positive,"WOW, what a difference from my awful experience at the last Transmissions shop (check my reviews, be very aware of that awful shop). 

Pete... was very helpful on the phone. Stayed late so that I could drop off my Bronco for a transmission rebuild. Price is great! Service Great! This is how you treat customers... 
Thanks again Pete for raising the bar for Quality Transmission repairs in the Valley!!!
J
Update...Feb 2016 great job. Very happy.
Update... Apr 2018 still running great!"
positive,I took 2 different vehicles here Toyota 4runner for rack and pinion and Ford transit connect for transmission. Both times these guys have taken care of me when others quoted high prices they always came in under and my first choice when taking a care in. Hats off to national automotive for their honest and dependable work.
positive,"Honesty is a rarity in this day and age so when I have dealings with an honest business  man/woman I wanna shout it from the rooftops.

In this case the honest man is Brock, owner of National Transmission on 14th street N.W. This man has bent over backwards and stayed past closing time to resolve our work truck issues.

He is as honest as they come and I consider him to be an expert in his field so if you have an issue with your transmission and don't want to pay a ton and have your tranny problems resolved Brock would be the man to see.

QUICK NOTE WHEN LOOKING AT SATELLITE PIC I SEE THE CORRECT ADDRESS BEING 343 - 14TH STREET N.W. LOCATED BESIDE THE REGAL BEAGLE PUB."
positive,"Was in from out of town and had a check engine light on my 2014 SRX.  Set up a service visit on the web site and received a call confirming a slightly different but acceptable service time.  Good communications from Jessica Hartman, she was responsive and professional.  Showed up at the dealer, was greeted promptly and courteously by Roy who listened to my description of the issues then got the vehicle in right away.  I stayed in the comfortable customer waiting area for about 2 hours while the techs performed scheduled routine maintenance on the car and replaced a part in the intake of the engine that showed faulty on the diagnostics.  The car was cleaned inside and out which was really nice given the long trip it had just been subjected to.  I don't get to praise car dealers very often however the folks at Earnhardt earned it with me.  I have no experience with their sales department but can certainly say the service department is top notch."
positive,"Bastone was able to get my car into the shop the very day I was out looking to get my car repaired. Carl, the man who assisted me, was very friendly, addressed all my concerns, and called me with an estimate before doing work (front end and alignment). Compared to the horror stories you can read online, their prices are very reasonable. I picked up my car a few hours later and the steering is tight, dead-center, and hasn't felt this good to drive since I bought it. I will definitely be returning if any other problem with my car arises. Nice work guys."
positive,"I just had some work done at this place on my town car - a 1997 silver Lincoln wih 110000 miles on it.  The first place I went to said the transmission was bad and it would cost about $1,750 to fix it.  Well I said forget that Ill just drive it until it drops.  Then I took it to Econo Lube / which is now a Meineke - and the car runs amazing.  I had it fixed for $150 and was out the door in 1 hour.  These guys are great.  I took my other car in for an oil change.  Excellent"
positive,stopped in while getting my car repaired very friendly place I had the number 4 combo taco and gordita combo.  Very tasty.
positive,This place is my savior! Nicest guys ever and they don't try to screw you. Nissan dealership tried to charge me 740 for a new muffler! This place saved me 600 dollars and had it done in 30 minutes first thing in the morning. My car is perfect! Very satisfied with the service
positive,"I have been her two times. The first time my check engine light came on, it scared me. I had a test done at Auto Zone to see why the light came on, they said it was something to do with my gas tank. I then took my car to Lindsay Auto and instead of charging me all this money to do test and look at everything, Sean the owner said most likely i had a faulty gas cap, he wanted me to try it out for a day to see if the light would remain off, and it DID! very thoughtful of him to think of the cost for others. 
       Just a few weeks ago my boyfriend ran over something and it cut a large hole in his gas tank, they looked at his car right away and said the whole tank needed replaced. The car was a 2013 so we thought for sure it would be a lot because of the year, but Sean then made the effort to find a used one and we didn't have to pay much, and didn't have to go through insurance.  I never had an auto service that treated me like a family member. i recommend this place to all my friends and family, very trust worthy."
positive,"All I can say is WOW!!!! Wish there were more stars I could give these guys! If you're looking for a place that you can trust to service your vehicle, look no further. We had been servicing our vehicles at Towbin for years and recently had an issue with the transmission in my daughter's Jeep Patriot. We tried another dealer who basically told us nothing was wrong with the vehicle so we went back to our friends at Towbin. 
JR and his team took exceptional care of my daughter. John, the shop foreman, drove the car with my daughter and of course it didn't make the noise we had been hearing. But instead of dismissing her like the other shop, he kept the car for the day and assured my daughter they would test the car a few more times to see if they could duplicate the problem. John was amazing and explained everything in detail. On one of the rides, he took the transmission tech who immediately diagnosed the problem.  Eddie who helped my daughter with a loaner vehicle was awesome. Communication was excellent, everyone promised they would contact her when they had an answer and she received a call before the end of the day.  Parts were in stock, repairs were started immediately and she had her Jeep back sooner than expected. Kudos to JR and his team - quality service on your vehicle and exceptional customer service. I highly recommend Towbin, they will take great care of you."
positive,"Just moved to Vegas and my check engine light came on.   Stopped at the dealership with hopes they could see me.  Lisa in the service dept. could not have been more helpful.    They got my car in to see what code it was showing and then set up an appointment to get it repaired.  I needed a new 02 sensor.   The service department was immaculate, courteous and professional.  The car has never been better.   Everyone here was so helpful from getting me a water to showing me where the waiting area was.   They all seemed to want to help and work together."
positive,I had an issue with this dealership in the past but I decided to give them another chance after talking to corporate. I went in the other day because my check engine light was on. Greg and his team were very helpful. They let me use a loaner car over the holiday weekend and resolved my dilemma.
positive,"I've been to CARS on two separate occasions, once with my wife's 2009 Volkswagen Tiguan, and once with my 2016 Chevrolet Colorado.  My wife's Tiguan's check engine light came on, and the mechanic shop I was visiting recommended CARS to me since they specialized in German made vehicles.  After talking to one of the owners (Eddie I believe his name was) on a Saturday (I just showed up and he was doing paperwork on the weekend, but the shop isn't open for business) he advised I bring the car back on Monday for a diagnostic.  After he diagnosed the problem, I did some googling and found that it was a known issue with the make and model of her car, and that VW would perform the repair for free.  While Eddie didn't earn my business for this issue, his correct diagnosis earned him my business in the future.  Points to them for their professionalism.

For my second visit, I brought in my 2016 Chevrolet Colorado to have a K&N cold air intake installed.  Moe said they normally work on German cars, but that they would gladly install the intake for me.  It didn't take them long to complete the installation, and the billing for their time to install the intake was fair; best of all, my truck sounds great!  This shop is honest, and fair, I will definitely be back to CARS again for anything I need for my truck, or my wife's SUV."
positive,"Dropped my car off for an oil change on the fly. Tim was very nice over the phone and was able to schedule me same-day. This location is very close to the 55 bus line so I was able to drop off my car and still make it into work on time! Great price, $26 out the door for my oil change w/ inspection and tire rotation. This location is open until after 7p making it ideal for office zombies in need of pick ups after 5. I'm very impressed with the friendly service I received. As a woman, I worry about the myriad of ""problems"" that will be found when I leave my car somewhere for a simple service. Tim called to express a concern about my muffler. After a quick chat and more detailed inspection all was deemed a-ok and he even left a hand written note to let me know all was well. I'll certainly be returning! Thanks the great experience."
positive,"When I take my car in to The KAR Shop I'm comforted in knowing it will be taken care of and this time was no different. At my last service, Kris recommended that my motor mounts needed replacing and boy was he right! Not only that, when replacing the motor mount they discovered that the transmission had one severed bolt and one on it's way out which they took care of. What a difference this made! My car now drives like it's new again!"
positive,"These guys did a fantastic job transforming my Infinity G37. They installed a new cold air intake system, high flow cats and exhaust, coil overs, larger wheels and tires and did a dyno tune. Mike did a great job helping me select the correct parts and made sure everything worked well together. Picked up 40 HP and the car handles and drives like a sports sedan costing many more $$ than I have into it. Had a small glitch with a check engine light and Rich was right on it the next day and took care of it. Would HIGHLY recommend this shop. For what was done to my car the pricing was fair and a great value. Maybe not the cheapest but you get what you pay for and these guys are worth every penny. I will definitely be using Dyno Comp for all my performance car needs."
positive,"I had my SUV  transmission  repaired at Litchfield Auto and they are the most professional & honest auto repair shop that I have ever done business with. They assessed the problem, gave me a firm quote and delivered the car back to me on time as promised. Highly recommended and if you ever what to contact me about the  quality of work they preform please do so @ smeekers@msn.com."
positive,"Service Department - Took my Prius in when the check engine light came on and was helped by Dan.  We had just bought the car from a different Toyota dealership a month before.  Dan was friendly and helpful, had a small problem with the gas cap fixed and even provided a complimentary car wash.  There was no charge and we were very happy customers!"
positive,"Great customer service but needed a push to get it. 

Not going into all the details. They ran into an issue with an oil change. Didn't take responsibility for the problem. Went home, did some research online and spoke with a auto repair shop owner, found out the issue was most likely (60 - 70%) was caused by the shop. Contacted Big O HQ on their website. A few days later, got a call from Ryan, the manager,  offering to take care of the problem. We arrived at a mutual agreement. They fixed the problem, even added Freon to my ac no charge, and my next oil change is on the house. 

One more thing: I didn't care for trying to push a transmission flush. I suggest anyone thinking about it research it first. It can cause more problems then it's worth. If your transmission is working fine, the fluid isn't real dirty, not slipping or acting up, you probably don't need it. I'm not a mechanic, just passing along what I found out. 

I'm very happy with the final outcome and how it was handled. Just wish they would've taken responsibility at the beginning, even partly would've been nice. Hence the 4 stars and not 5."
positive,"Phil (owner) is awesome. He truly cares about servicing your vehicle and not only that, but educating you on what services he performed and why he performed it. Labor cost is average and compared to other places you go, the service here is definitely worth the labor cost above all other repair shops I've been to. I used to take my old 2000  Camry down here that was just a ticking time bomb on when something new was going to go out. Whether it be a starter or just my check engine light. Phil kept that baby running all the way up to 275k miles until I made the personal decision to upgrade vehicles. Keep it up LP auto repair! It's not just the work you do, but the extra service and care you provide! Much appreciated"
positive,"I was in town for a funeral when my check engine light came on I called 2 other Honda dealerships that were closer and was told they could not help.  

Called Sunnyside went out of there way and scheduled my vehicle in the next day.  They found the problem fixed it and had my vehicle back to me in a few hours.  The service department did a great job.  If I lived in the area I would only consider using them."
positive,"It all started when my check engine light started flashing while taking my eldest son to school. Being the procrastinator that I am, I typically like to wait until I cant anymore but just with driving a mile round-trip, it was more than obvious something was *actually* wrong with my car. When I called The KAR Shop, Kris (the owner) answered & when I asked how busy they were & if it'd be possible to have my car looked at fairly soon, he informed me that the sooner I could get it checked out, the better (apparently flashing = BAD). Not once did I feel like I was being taken advantage of due to my lack of knowledge relating to cars (I'm sure many females out there can relate!) but Kris was extremely accommodating and drove me (& my other son) home so that we weren't stranded there until they were done! He also assured me that I'd either have my car back by the time I'd need to grab my older son from school or I'd be provided with a rental, which definitely helped alleviate some anxiety relating to the situation. Turns out I needed a new cylinder and I also had them replace my passenger window motor that had just started having issues a couple weeks prior (and it was all done before school got out!). If I ever have any issues again, I know exactly who I can trust to do quality repairs at a reasonable price with phenomenal customer service!"
positive,"Definitely a 5 star rating. I first went to Dave's Car Care about 6 years ago with my Isuzu Amigo. I had 3 other mechanics diagnose an issue that I had with it because it wouldn't pass emissions. My gut told me that they weren't diagnosing it correctly so then I took it to Dave's. I felt real comfortable with the diagnostics and the price. I went ahead and had them service my vehicle and it passed. Most recently I had a transmission issue with my truck. I had them install a rebuilt one in the vehicle. Unfortunately, it went bad after about 26 months and was no longer in warranty. Thank God I had it serviced at Dave's. They assisted me in purchasing and installing another rebuilt transmission at a fraction of the original one (even though the warranty had expired). I've since referred them to my friends and have been a loyal customer since. I will continue using them and highly recommend them to everyone."
positive,"My husband and I found this shop from yelp. My husband's car broke down on the freeway and he had to find somewhere to tow it to asap. We've both had mechanics here and there but never a place that we were really satisifed with...until this place. The owner Alex is amazing! Not only does he know exactly what he is doing, but we have never felt like we were getting ripped off. We now bring both of our cars there and have referred friends and coworkers to him. 

This is a mechanic who gives you his personal cell phone number. A mechanic who has actually driven to our house to look at our car when that lovely ""check engine light"" came on. 

We will never take our cars anywhere else. It's so rare to find a mechanic that is trustworthy in Las Vegas. 

(also FYI - the shop's address didn't come up when I entered it into my GPS....it's basically off of lakemead and 215 in henderson. Just call for directions)"
positive,"I brought my newly bought used car into C&S Auto, that I would use for my Ubering, that I bought from a seller that said ""Everything is like new""...they lied. The motor was loose and about to fall out the car. C&S fixed this but then AFTER I found out there was another hidden issue. The seller cleared the check engine light to fool me...I was burned by a local seller. I am not rich so this hurts everything I've worked for and effects my future. C&S understood my situation and made a deal to take money off the total price to help me out. They really care about their customers. I highly recommend them to anyone."
positive,"My car didn't pass the smog so took my car here to see what the problem was looks like my transmission needed to be replaced, I didn't have the money to fix it so he did what he can to buy us some time awesome guy really helped us out the lady in the office is super nice I will take my car back for any problems finally found an honest mechanic"
positive,Took good care of me and kept me in the loop with my transmission problem went above and beyond. Excellent service
positive,This is the place you have only heard of in dreams. A place that genuinely cares about the customer. We had taken in our 2016 Dodge Journey for a check engine light and when we explained the problem they suggested taking it into the dealer because it would likely be covered under the emissions warranty on the car. Just the fact that they told us that was awesome. I know we will be coming here again with any issues we encounter with our car. Thank you guys for being a stand up business.
positive,"March 2014 update:

I took my 2010 Escape to Whitey's for an oil change and have them check for a leak.

The tech did the oil change and found the problem with the transmission, which only shows up when the Escape is traveling.  The Whitey's tech asked if I had power train warranty, as I purchased the Escape at Auto Nation Ford; the Escape came with as Ford Certified which is power train for 75,000 miles of 5 years, so I was covered. The Whitey's tech told me there was a Technical Service Bulletin on this issue and that I should go to the dealer to get it fixed under warranty. 

The staff at Whitey's then printed out the Technical Service Bulletin for me to take to Auto Nation Ford!  

How many shops have this level of technical competence and then send you someplace else to get it fixed?

Auto Nation Ford  fixed the problem which was exactly as Whitey's found it.

I am happy with Whitey's. I would never take either of my SUV's to any other shop, unless they send me to the dealer. :-)"
positive,"So happy I found mechanics I can trust! I have taken my car to Superior for a new starter, brakes & tires in the past. They do great work & are honest, affordable & fast. Recently, I took my car in for what I thought was a transmission or some other major issue. It turned out to be a minor electrical problem that just needed to be reset. They took care of that at no charge. I could not be happier with their service. I highly recommend!!"
positive,"I can't tell you how wonderful Jack was. I had a $900 estimate from my dealership. A friend told me to talk to Jack. I needed a transmission flush and a tune up. $900!!!!! Talk to Jack, and after 2 full inspections (because he couldn't understand why the dealership wanted so much) he called me with an estimate for $350!!!! They were nice and very professional. Thank you so much guys!"
positive,"This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  

The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!"
positive,I have all the work done on my cars at lifetime automotive.  recently i had to take my truck in cause the transmission was going out.  The Owner went above and beyond to find me many affordable options to replace it.  this is just one of may reasons i love this shop and the people who work there.  they are honest and there prices are the best.  Thanks lifetime automotive for taking care of my vehicles and for the awesome service at a affordable price.
positive,"Chris Aizpitarte is AMAZING! He knew exactly what the issue was with my car as soon as I told him what it was doing! I had taken it to my local Nissan dealer in July when I first had this issue and they just blew me off! 
My transmission needed to be replaced and he had it all done very fast! Brought it to the dealership on Saturday morning and it was done late afternoon on Monday!"
positive,"We are very satisfied with our service here! We worked with Brian K - he took his time with us, explained everything in detail, called us with updates, patiently answered our questions, and got our car back to us much faster than we expected. I highly recommend this shop if you need to have your car repaired. The service was excellent, and our car looks incredible. I also really appreciate that Gerber offers a lifetime guarantee. I know it is unfortunate to have to have your car repaired, but this is a place you can really trust!"
positive,"I recently went to this Autozone because my check engine light was on.  While I was waiting to be helped, I had noticed one of the employees outside helping an older gentleman replace something, maybe a headlight.  When they were finished, I noticed they shook hands and the customer left very happy.  Then, it was my turn.  I told the employee, Randy, why I was in and he immediately came out to check the codes.  While we were out there, I mentioned to him that I wanted to address this issue so I could then fix the whistling sound I was hearing from the engine. Randy immediately asked me to pop the engine so he could take a look.  Within a minute, he identified the problem.  Without my asking, he said he'd be back & returned with a replacement hose, installing it for me.  It was then that I realized this type of service was just protocol for Randy.  He truly enjoys helping others.  A side benefit is he is the reason why customers will return.

Many times when visiting autoparts stores, it seems to me that the employees are disinterested in helping their customers really understand and resolve their concerns.  Their role is to solely identify the correct replacement part and sell it to you.  After this, you are on your own.  

If you are lucky enough to visit this Autozone while Randy is working, I am confident you will leave a more informed & satisfied customer.  Thanks, Randy, for putting in the little extra effort that makes a big difference!!"
positive,Have to say Pete knows his transmissions.  Had my avalanche in and out so quick for about half the price elsewhere. Friendly people who you can tell have been here doing this for a long time. Quoted a price over the phone and no hidden fees. The other transmission place I went to said they would have to actually take my tranny off to give me an accurate quote. They quoted 2000-3000$ which is a big gap. It was 1150 out the door here at Petes  It was the holiday and they still had it done in 2 business days. And I also had a complicated payment situation which they made easy and painless. Thanks again for knowing what great service means!
positive,"I needed an oil change and went back to Superior Tire since they did a great job last year w my alignment at a fair price for a lifetime alignment.  Thomas got my car in pretty quick even though they were busy.  After about an hour, he told me there was an issue he wanted to show me.  He brought me back to check out my transmission seal leak, but didn't pressure me to fix it that day.  He gave me an estimate to fix it and just let me know it needed to be done.  No pressure to fix it 'today' (and it seemed like a fair price).  While he also gave me an option to replace the front axle (since it was only a small addition in time and price), he didn't try to push me into fixing it (only pointed out the benefit if I chose to fix it ).  Thanks Thomas and the rest of the team at Superior Tire."
positive,"My 9 year old Hyundai decided to give up in a parking garage.  Big Jim was the recommendation of AAA once it was determined I was beyond their services.  Big Jim talked me through my transmission problems, found a used one that was a perfect match, and gave me options of investment vs. results. He was easy to talk to and kept me updated on progress.  He gave me straight answers when I asked about preventative actions moving forward (spoiler: northeast winters are an inevitable death sentence).  Vehicle drives just the way I'm used to.  I will definitely be bringing my vehicle back - exponentially better than the dealership I dealt with back in NJ.  THANK YOU"
positive,"My boyfriend and I decided to stay here for 4th of July weekend, and overall it was a great stay. Check-in was super easy and fast. Parking is $14 a night which kind of stinks but it is less expensive than other hotels in the area. They don't tell you that there is a fee; I only knew from reading reviews online so beware of that. I had no problem with the parking lot. You use your room key to get through the gate and there were plenty of spaces when we were there. 

The room was very clean, spacious, and updated. There was a microwave and mini fridge which was nice. Our view was of a rocky rooftop so that was kind of a bummer, but we weren't expecting anything spectacular. 
Housekeeping came everyday and were very good. We ate breakfast there twice, but didn't get there until 9:15 so there wasn't a crazy selection left but decent enough. There was cereal, oatmeal, sausage, eggs, bagels, english muffins, and cinnamon rolls which were delicious.

One of the main reasons why I chose this hotel was because they have a shuttle which drives you anywhere within a 3 mile radius (which is pretty much anywhere since everything is so close). We used the shuttle the first day to go to station square which is only 1 mile away. It was quick and easy. Around 10 pm we called the hotel to have the shuttle pick us up, and he told us that the transmission broke on the shuttle and it's not running anymore. Ok, no big deal, we just took Uber back. The next day we asked about the shuttle and found out that another hotel was working with our hotel and we could get picked up by them. They arrived quickly and we got dropped off at Point State Park. We called our hotel again around 10:10 pm (the shuttle is supposed to run until 10:30), and asked if we could get picked up. The guy was like ummmm the shuttle hasn't been running all day. So I explained that earlier on in the day we used the other hotel's shuttle. He knew nothing about that and again we were stranded, so we took another Uber. If the transmission broke then fine, but I have my suspicions that the transmission didn't actually break and the driver just wanted off for the holiday weekend because it just seemed like pretty convenient timing and the van was only sitting at the hotel after it ""broke"" for the holiday. But who knows.

The location of the hotel is awesome. There is a Domino's on the same street and and gas station/convenience store as well. You can walk 2 blocks down and you are on E Carson St which is where all of the bars and restaurants are, so you don't have to worry about transportation back from there because you can just walk. 

We were going to stay at the Wyndham instead of this hotel because it would have been convenient for the fireworks but chose this instead because it was cheaper, parking was cheaper, they didn't have a microwave and fridge in the room, and based on reviews the rooms seem to be cleaner here. I would stay at this hotel again definitely, I just wish there was more of a view of the river at least from the room we stayed in. But overall it was a very good experience."
positive,"So I have been to a few of these Firestones and Jiffy Lube type places with my company car because of the fleet services preferred vendors.  I have been to both this Firestone location now, as well as the one on William Penn Hwy just down the road a bit.  These two locations are not created equal in my experience.  If you want a good, trustworthy Firestone to go to, I say go here!  

I had just had my car into a Jiffy Lube for a check up exactly two weeks before I had to come in here... they said everything was fine, did what they had to (change oil and filter) and sent me on my way. I do not expect them to find every little thing but when they said they did what the Fleet company had asked, I assumed that they looked at some of the other basics.  My check engine light came on Thursday (just 13 days after this) and I had to get it in somewhere.  I remembered that the Mall had a location (at least I can go get lunch and walk around if it will take awhile, right?).  The location on William Penn Hwy was fine but after I had my experience with this one, I will be loyal here... they were able to fix something that the Wm Penn Hwy location could not and was not willing to (a terrible sound of a loose heat shield). 

They got me in right away, kept me posted on where they were at with things, looked at the whole picture of things, dealt with my Fleet company, and fixed something that I was told could not be fixed.  The few staff that I had interacted with were so helpful and nice too.  This made what was an annoying experience and unforeseen problem/stressor better. 

I will definitely be taking all of my service here now as I cannot complain about anything."
positive,This repair shop gets a+. My uncles suv is having transmission problems. Jim took my uncle out with him for a test drive to see what was happening. I'm so glad Jim is a straight shooter and my uncle is 80 years old and he didn't bs my uncle and take advantage of him like other shops do. I talked with Jim about the pros and cons of replacing the transmission or let my uncle just drive it until it breaks. The suv is a 2007 and the cost of a new transmission was almost the value of the value of the suv. We decided to hold off on the transmission    I highly recommend talking to Jim if you are having transmission problems. He's a straight shooter we need more repair shops like this one.  Kudos Jim
positive,"Had an appointment to get my transmission oil flushed 9am, dropped car off at 830am.. Got $25 off from Yelp! But also offered other coupons they offer..
Met with The store manager John Trent & he was great!!! I have an older car 2005.. Its normal to always be skeptical when going in to mechanic shops, bcuz they try to Rip you off... NOT THIS PLACE.. 
Ended up also getting my rear brakes, drums etc fixed cuz I had trust in this place.. Let you test drive car after work done, showed you hands on, no BS.. 
Highly recommended..
Also.... This store has the cleanest bathroom that I have ever seen in A mechanic shop!!!!!"
positive,"My review is about service, not sales. I have no information about the sales side of things. I was in town with my husband on a business trip. I had my car serviced at Carmax in Inglewood, CA before heading to LV. Carmax said everything was fine, they replaced some valve (that turns out probably didn't even need to be replaced), and the engine light went off, so we headed out for the trip. Well, it was not fine. The engine started racing at times and then would drag horribly to the point that 18-wheelers were passing us going uphill. We were worried about getting stranded in the dessert in 110 degree temp with little to no cell signal and towns miles apart. We finally made it to LV, and I called a Dodge dealership the next morning to have them check it. I happened to call Chapman and talked with David Richards.

David was awesome. He told me that I needed a new catalytic converter (which Carmax cleared the signal on and obviously didn't test drive it to find out if it was fixed and therefore it didn't get replaced) and that the Carmax service person installed the valve wrong, which is why the check engine light came back on. I called Carmax corporate and told them the nightmare of what we had gone through. It was a really long, painful story. She was helpful. She understood the seriousness of the problem that we experienced and got some managers on it. They called me, and they worked with David to take care of the check engine diagnostic fee.  Chapman replaced my cat (which most other dealerships I talked to in the days prior didn't even keep in stock) under the Dodge warranty but still wanted their diagnostic fee. I understood but I wasn't about to pay it since Carmax had screwed me. The big wig at Carmax in CA arranged payment to David (all they had to do was put a pin in correctly to seat the valve), and Chapman had the cat replaced in a jiffy. I couldn't believe it.

I'm grateful to David for all the support and working with Carmax and to Chapman  for all the rides to and from my hotel. We had no trouble on the way back to Los Angeles. I hope I never have to have service again while in LV, but if I do, I know where I'm taking my car."
positive,"Prices are industry standard $95/hr. The difference is if nothing is wrong with the car they won't charge anything. I've been going here since 2012. Several times I've got estimates for repair work and on at least two occasions check engine light was tripped for nothing and they didn't charge me. If your having difficulty diagnosing a problem and don't wanna spend the $ take it here. If you tell them about a problem and take it in for an oil change they will borderline advance diagnose your car for you to find the problem wo charging. They catch problems other shops don't. They explain in detail what's happening or why some parts are preventitive maintenance. It's been a nice place to frequent, the atmosphere is really friendly and unlike other businesses in the area everyone is welcome no matter where your from."
positive,"My check engine light came on a couple of weeks ago. I went to two autozones and they could not read it. Came here and they did.

I always thought that O'Reilly's had more experienced people working there in general. I still do!"
positive,"$7.77 cheapest smog check in town. They also check out your car for maintenance issues but there's no pressure to repair anything they find.

Wait is a bit long, but that's what happens when things cost less. Show up early or be prepared to wait about half an hour.

Tip: if your check engine light is on you will automatically fail the smog check. Take care of that first. Just clearing the codes at Autozone can work. Or take it to Panda at Desert Inn and Jones."
positive,"2 Cars/2 Transmissions in less than a year.

Brothers and owners, Brian and Kevin have replaced the transmission in two of my cars.  One done in Spring, 2012, the other, February 2013.  I've had 2 excellent experiences. 

I had never heard of them before but pursued them upon a recommendation.  The second time I needed their service, I met their dad who gave me a little bit of background about the shop he started years ago.

Brian and Kevin grew up learning from their father who started his Fairview Park transmission business back in the 40's. He had  to relocate and the shop has been in North Olmsted for years.

To top it off, Park Auto Clinic's price is excellent.  A family member had an estimate of 1,600 dollars from another shop.  I told them to go to Park Auto Clinic--a couple of hundred dollars cheaper-- great work--dedicated family-run business.
 
These guys have worked on transmissions all of their life and that's all they do.  They are experts.  

By the way, they had both my cars done within three days of dropping them off.   And, with both of my cars, they asked me to come back within 3-4 weeks to make sure that everything was working well.  

These gentlemen are some of the most honest, nice people I've ever dealt with.  I can't say enough about what a great experience I've had twice with Park Auto Clinic"
positive,"This place did a fantastic job.  Every single person I spoke to here was friendly, welcoming & courteous.  The process to have my car repaired was streamlined & it was ready 3 days earlier than they estimated.  My car was hit by someone with Geico insurance.  This was one of their preferred repair shops.  In house Geico inspector & Enterprise car rentals.  They fixed the damage, replaced my bumper, did body work above my fender & passenger door.  Repainted & matched the original paint perfectly.  This process couldn't have been easier.  Robert was great too.  Thank you!"
positive,USA Auto get the job done efficiently and they will treat you respectfully never have I been hustled like in other places I am coming back to do transmission and coolant services thank you guys
positive,"I was first introduced to Joe's Auto Avondale, AZ by a flyer advertisement that came in the mail. At the time, I needed to get a transmission service and a fuel injection service. They had some coupons in the advertisement for the services I needed. The prices were amazing compared to the GM dealer. I arrived at the location 10/30/14 to get the services completed.  One of the managers Taylor provided excellent customer services, he was knowledgeable to answer my car service questions, he was up front with the costs associated with the job and they are efficient and work quickly. This place offers such a great value at an affordable price. I was very impressed with my first experience. Joe's Auto is a simple family owned auto shop with 5 other stores in Arizona. The storefront is clean, they have some chairs to sit while you wait, a nice TV and free WIFI if you ask. 

On 11/4/14, I was back to get my check engine light checked out to diagnose the issue. Jeff had checked me in and processed my service. He provided awesome customer services, was knowledgeable in answering all my questions and it was a personable experience.  I ended up needing an intake camshaft actuating part for my engine since the hydraulic mechanism was non-operational. It was a dealer only part so they had the part delivered within 45 minutes and the job was completed in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Again, I was very happy and impressed with my experience here. I highly recommend taking your vehicle here for future services. Why pay more at the dealer when you can support a family owned business and get your vehicle services done at a reasonable price. Keep up the great work guys! To the owner - Keep your employees happy and take good care of them because they are clearly running your business very well. I will tell everyone I know about my experience here and share all around social media. Thanks!"
positive,"Ok. So, that tranmission thing is important. If you don't check on it every year, the fluids and all that jazz, it could go very wrong and if your tranmission blows, it can cost a whopper to fix. So we must be preventative. But I'm the luckiest girl in the world. My Dad maintains my car for me. He winterizes it. He has a solid relationship with a local mechanic when the job is more complicated then he can do (and my Dad can do A LOT!). My Dad's work is basically fixing up cars and selling them. He knows cars. And my whole family drives 90's vehicles (we're old school!). But we take a lot of pride in our cars!

My Dad uses National Transmission.
So I use National Tranmission.
Now that I'm a big girl, I take my car there myself.
I call them up and usually talk to the ever-pleasant Brock at the beginning of the week.
I say I need to have my transmission serviced.
Usually they do it on Wed, Thurs or Fri morning, I think. Or maybe that's when you can get fit in easily. Usually it'll be at 9 or 10 AM. They need it for a good 1-1.5 hours. So I drop it off, walk into Kensington for a coffee, return and Voila! Magic. Done. Reasonable. Friendly.

You certainly don't have to fear looking after your car with places like this. My Dad trusts them and my Dad knows cars so I feel good in recommending this location!"
positive,"Ewing has a customer for life in my husband and I. We went out to Red Rock canyon for what we thought would be a quick drive. Hadn't been off roading recently but we were going to check out an easy run. Pulled off to the side of a trail and husband tried to engage the 4 wheel drive. After a small struggle to engage the gear, we lost all tension in the 4 wheel drive and lost any gears in the normal transmission. We were afraid we had blown the transmission completely. As we started counting dollar signs of repair in our heads, we flagged down some park workers who said they would send a ranger out to us. 20 min later, a ranger found us and called in a tow. Based on where we were, a flatbed wasn't going to work. A four wheel drive wrecker was the only option...at an estimated rate of $275 an hour...and a 2-3 hour wait. Being 2:30 already...we resigned to being in it for the long haul. The ranger came back to let us know that they found a wrecker to be there in an hour. Thank God!

As we enjoyed the scenery of red rocks and big horn goats, we eyed the wrecker coming up the trail. Jon showed up with a great attitude and conversational spirit. He could have easily just strung the jeep up and pulled us back to town but...he problem solved with us. Luckily, a fellow jeeper stopped by and offered help. Turns out transmission was generally fine, we just busted the 4 wheel drive cable. Jon was able to leverage the cable back to the 2H position and we DROVE out of the trail...thousands of dollars saved. 

Jon will be getting a Christmas gift from The Bennett's this year."
positive,"Friendly guy @ the service dept. My check engine light was on so he made sure he checked everything out including recalls on my 09 Kia borrego and had them all taken care of. Dropped off the car b4 11am car was washed and ready @3pm, for dealership wait time that's not too bad. My car is under warranty so it was no charge but now I know a service place that is knowledgeable and reliable for any of my Kia needs!"
positive,"We drove to Las Vegas on vacation from Los Angeles, which is a 300 mile drive.  During the last 60 miles, we noticed something terribly wrong with our Honda Odyssey and drove slowly on the shoulder until we got into town.  We first took the minivan to Sears Auto Repair, but they said we needed to go to a Honda specialist.  We next went to the local Honda dealer.  The mechanic hooked the vehicle up to the computer and said the code indicated that we needed a new transmission.  They proceeded to write up a quote for $4,600.  The vehicle is a 2004 model with only 89,000 miles on it.  Based upon all the positive reviews on Yelp, we took our minivan to James at Hondatronics.  James told us that the code said that there was a gear problem, but that he did not know for sure whether we needed a new transmission or not.  He recommended that we flush the transmission fluid a few times since it was extremely dirty and gritty, which cost us only $226.  He then suggested that we drive it around town, and that we stop back before we leave Vegas to make sure the fluid is still clean (which we did and it was).  Should we need a new transmission, James quoted us $3,300.  James suggested we drive home keeping the speed under 65 mph and the RPMs below 2500.  We followed James' advice and made it home safely without any problems.  Now we can drive the vehicle around town and see what happens.  We may still need a new transmission.  Only time will tell.  But the problem may prove to be only that we needed clean transmission fluid.  Imagine spending $4,600 at the Honda Dealership for something we may not even need.  James was honest and up front, kind and helpful, and we really appreciated all that he did for us.  We were really lucky to have found James, given that we were from out of town and did not know anyone from whom we could have gotten a personal referral.  But thanks to Yelp we found this gem!"
positive,"This is by far the best used car dealership in Las Vegas.  It takes a lot for a dealership (or any type of business for that matter) to portray exceptional effort and go the extra mile to accomodate any and all used car needs that Cartwright does. They have exhibited true humanity by being able to acknowledge, rectify, and learn from all past mishaps and discrepincies that they, unfortunately, conducted in the past due to circumstances beyond their control at the time. 
In October of last year, I purchased a used Mercedes in what seemed to be in overall good condition.  I test drove it and had all vital areas checked out to conclude it all seemed to be in good working order. The signing and over all initial mandatory purchase paperwork was rather smooth. November I ran into a ""hiccup"" with some questions on the contact and a couple minor issues with the vehicle that wasn't disclosed.  Two months later (December), my car began to have major transmission issues. I took it back in (again) to see what could be done to fix this problem, since it had only been a couple months. I will admit, I went through Hell and high water for about three months with them over various issues. I won't get into the specifics, but literally had never been through such a stressful ordeal to this caliber. I had enough and couldn't take it anymore and was ready to pursue legal action. 
Low and behold, I had called one last time in February only to find out that due to, great misfortune, there had been a lot of scandalous people that manifested a plethora of havoc and issues in various ways and had just been caught. 
I was assured that every employee that had previously worked there had been immediately terminated and the new plan of action was to correct all negative experiences/ issues with past clients to the best of their ability. They have definitely delivered on that promise. I have never witnessed a company go so out of their way to make things right with a consumer. It's truly shocking that a dealership could be humble enough to admit that, unfortunately, they were a tarnished company for a minute duration; but have the determination to right wrongs and continue to persevere. They certainly have with me and I would absolutely purchase my next vehicle from them and, with great confidence, recommend them to EVERYONE."
positive,"took my van to here after finding them on Google. they were able to see me right away and give me some info on what was wrong with it as the check engine light was on. After about half an hour, they found what was wrong and said they needed to take it to the dealer for a warranty part to be replaced and were going to keep it overnight. The next day after it was fixed, they offered to get the emissions tested for me also at the state station. Ben was great to deal with and explained everything to me during every step. 

I would recommend them for any of your vehicles needs. They do everything there. I have a new mechanic."
positive,I had a super positive experience with Alex. Another dealership quoted me 2k just for the transmission. At Camelback vW i got quoted 848 + tx and the regulator on my window was repaired. They were honest to me and updated me via email and text. I am so happy with them! Ask for Alex. They totally turned around my opinion of vw dealerships!
positive,"We had my daughter's car repaired after it was hit on NYE , and we needed it back by January 13 for her to go back to college in AZ. Many shops could not get to this job before Jan 21. Maaco was friendly, accommodating, fast, professional, and courteous. We elected to have it repainted as there was some minor hail damage prior. The 2010 Mazda 3 looks fantastic, they did it within the time frame they promised and even gave me a ride all the way to Anthem when we dropped it off! I highly recommend them. Everyone here is very professional and respectful."
positive,"First off, I want to let people know that buying a used car is a gamble.  Most used cars are as-is situations.  If you buy from a private seller you really are taking a big chance.
Getting back to buying from Four seasons Motor Company.  I purchased a 2013 Ford Escape from them on a Monday morning.  The price was right ($10,500.) and the vehicle looked in excellent condition.  I took it home and realize that it had a whining noise coming from the rear of the car.  After listening to the Noise out on the freeway I determined that I needed to call the owner Tammie the same day.  She immediately  connected me to Larry, He told me to bring the car in the next day. 
I showed up at 930 am, I met Mike and we both went on a road test.  He determined that the rear wheels bearings were bad.  We went back to the office and the Owner Tammie had Keys for a loaner car for me to take while they got my car repaired.  At 430 pm same day I received a call telling me that the car was repaired.  They replaced both rear hubs with bearings at the cost off $409.00 which they paid. 

This is truly great customer service from Four Seasons Motor Company for  my purchase.  I want to thank the owner Tammie and the staff Mike for showing that they are a first class operation.  Buying a car from them was a great experience and I would do it again.

Thank you

positive,"Top notch customer service!! I'm new to Las Vegas and researched auto places in my area and this place stood out. I got a full tune up and more (oil change, spark plugs, ignition sensor, air filter, transmission flush and airbag service). I'm very satisfied and highly recommend this place. I didn't have to wait longer than two hours. Must go."
positive,"AMAZING! We were driving through from Salt Lake to LA when our check engine light came on. Found this place via Yelp and we pulled in after the repair shop closing hours. But the guys were still there and were incredibly nice and ran diagnostics and stayed late to fix the spark plug misfire and ran full diagnostics and got us back on the road that evening. And, here's the kicker, the price was super fair. I can't recommend these people highly enough. Pulling into an unknown car repair shop is a leap of faith at the best of times, but a few minutes before closing on a Friday night with an unknown problem is a setup for disaster. So lucky we found this shop!!"
positive,"I NEVER thought I would give Van Chevrolet a glowing review, but I am!! I had a 2012 Camaro ZL1 that I took into service years ago and was NOT IMPRESSED by the service or lack of it!! At that time the service department could not have been less helpful and non caring!! HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED!! I brought my 2015 Corvette Z06 with a problem with the car jerking when I braked normal. I was assigned my Service Consultant Kevin Martin (EXCELLENT)!! I explained to him the problem gave him the fob to my Z06 and left in a car provided by Van Chevrolet. I heard from Kevin MULTIPLE times keeping in touch and filling me in on the progress. He called and told me that they found it was a transmission problem probably linked to the multiple computers onboard the Corvette. They found the computer system had to be reprogramed to fix the problem. Once that was done, everything was fixed and they even realigned my Corvette. I have NOTHING but GOOD THINGS to say about Van Chevrolet and how they took care of me and my Corvette! But in my opinion NONE of this would have happened without the EXCELLENT attention to detail by my Service Consultant Kevin Martin!!"
positive,Recently had my transmission replaced in my Corvette. Even though this was warranty work their team communicated with me every step of the way. They had my car in and out within 5 days and handled all of the warranty communications for me. They fought for a replacement and not a rebuild which is what I got! On top of all of this my out of pocket for uncovered items was well below their estimate. This is now my families go to from now on.
positive,"I told my wife to go and get the car checked out.  In all fairness, my wife's naïveté precedes her.  I've found that mechanics always 'inflate' their prices until I show up and challenge it.  While Damon found a number of issues that absolutely need to be replaced, a quote from $710 to something just above $500 isn't.  

I never had Damon as my mechanic - Chris always took careof my cars.  This time around, Marlene seemed very cold and not the friendly person I'm used to.

Consistency, as you'll find in my posts, is important to me.  I no longer recommend this place.  

02/22/2018 - responding to Andrew A's note:

It's a shame, but I'm happy for Chris.  Being new to Vegas it was hard finding a shop you could trust.  Chris made an effort to try and salvage what happened with my wife and I just couldn't get over what that guy quoted her.  I'm in sales for a living and I always try to be a straight shooter.  Aiming high to negotiate is expected but 40%-50% over what it should have cost was messed up - how do you go from $700+ to $400 in the space of 2 conversations?  The guy even tried to do the fast math on me like I was buying a timesh

Chris and Marlene are a great team.  Marlene makes USA like you're Norm coming in to aisle up to the bar.  Chris gives it to you straight.  I really should have given them a chance to make it up to me, but I was forced to go out of the way to get it done.

If Chris and Marlene open a new place you can count I'll be going back, but not until they get rid of some of the people at USA Auto.


Update 05/25
Needed a smog check.  USA's smog deal at $7.99 is the best in town.  Met with Big Chris, who pointed out some issues with my vehicle that were a result of going to an 'independent' mechanic in North Town.  The hoses that were replaced by the mechanic was done sloppy - corrosion had seeped out from the connections.  

Big Chris showed me the condition of my transmission fluid and offered to clean it up.

Now, let me rewind here.  John Summers, the former manager, and Marlene had reached out to me after my last post to set things right, but I had become gun shy after. They're effort to win me back was a $100 credit to any service.  I didn't think I would ever need it, but I mentioned it to Big Chris who gave Marlene a call and got it authorized.

Even without John Summers as the current manager (he moved on), Big Chris kept their promise.

I'm back with my favorite auto experts and will definitely back again.  Thank you for the experience!

Another update 07/18
Damon's in charge.  I took up John on his offer to have a fuel purge sensor engine light checked out.  I knew what the issue was due to my Fixd sensor that I bought a few years back.  

He honored the $100 an threw in  tire rotation and an oil change.  Now, I checked around with the costs to compare and found that while he was on the high side, he 'ate' it on the labor.  Here's why - he goes to the dealer for parts and I understand how cash businesses work - he has to mark it up in order to show a profit.  Classic effort to reward.  Fair is fair.  He goes to the dealer because it's not a 'what if' or 'lets try this' shop.  Prices are a bit higher from the dealer, but we know it works.

Fast forward 2 weeks.  Check engine light comes on.  I freak out - I'm leaving town in 2 days and taking the car to SoCal.  It's great on gas - better than my beast Infiniti that drives fast, but guzzles gas like a thirsty man in a desert.  He cuts me a deal.  Says, I'll take care of it now and when you get back from vacation, hit me up and we'll take care of it - I'll charge you for the part only.

Done.  I honestly declare that this is the best auto shop in Vegas.  Honest, straightforward and they'll do what they have to, to make you happy.  

Props to Damon.  He's the best there is."
positive,I called these guys based on the experiences of the previous Yelpers- which frankly sounded too good to be true. Thanks Yelpers! Scottsdale Muffler and Automotive really is as great as you said! I needed my muffler and tailpipe replaced. I dropped the vehicle off before they opened in the morning. They called me with an estimate within a couple hours of opening and the price was awesome and much lower than I expected. They had the vehicle ready for pick up by the end of the day and...here's the best part ----***** THEY CHARGED ME EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID!***** I have lots of work to be done on my vehicles and I'll be going back Thanks you guys!
positive,"I first came to Atwood European 3 years ago after taking my 2007 CLS550 to a local dealership (who shall remain nameless) after having a strong smell of gasoline around my car inside and out - and in my garage - after fueling.  The dealership assured me the entire fuel tank had to be replaced at a cost of over $3,500.00.  I authorized some other work at the dealership regarding an issue with my trunk not opening and closing reliably and decided to seek a second opinion about the fuel smell.  Fortunately, I was talking to a co-worker whose parents had been taking their cars to Atwood for years with nothing but satisfying results.  I took my car there and after inspecting the vehicle, Andrew and his team determined that in fact, my fuel tank was fine and that my fuel pump was leaking and needed to be replaced - a $280 part - and that repair immediately (and permanently) solved the problem.

Six months later, I was still having problems with the trunk from the dealer's so-called repair and was due for routine service anyway, so I took the car back to Atwood.  I ended up needing full rear brakes and front pads as well, which I expected as I was starting to hear the usual warning sounds when pads are worn.  Andrew and team were able to determine that the issue with my trunk was actually a problem with wires in the wiring harness that were damaged due to wear (a design issue with this car) and instead of recommending replacing the entire harness, they repaired the section that was damaged, saving me hundreds in parts and much more in labor.

A year later, I had a front suspension strut beginning to fail and I took the car to Atwood.  Andrew was able to replace the strut with a part carrying a lifetime warranty (something a dealer can't/won't do), and he even refunded a day of my car rental due to timing issues with when he could get the car repaired.

Last year, I had a complete transmission failure while on a trip in Sedona (on a holiday, no less) and consulted with Andrew after leaving my car at another small independent shop in Sedona (Redrock Precision Motors - I highly recommend them as well).  I ended up having them replace the transmission with a rebuild carrying an unlimited mileage warranty.

Most recently, my other front strut failed as I was leaving for a trip to Flagstaff to visit my daughter at college.  This time, it was a more dramatic failure, requiring towing to the shop.  When we arrived at the shop late on a Friday afternoon, Andrew's lot was nearly full - inside and out - telling me that business is good, but also signaling that it might take a while to get my car done.  One of his crew drove me to the car rental place so that I could get a car to continue my slightly delayed weekend.  They didn't have to do this, but offered to because they knew the car rental shop was slammed and would take a while to come get me.  When I came back to town on Monday, I checked in with Atwood's answering service a couple times and was not terribly surprised not to hear back right away, knowing how busy they were.  As it turns out, their internet and phones were down on Monday and Andrew spent most of the night there with the service provider getting back online.  He called me back on Tuesday morning after getting all his messages and, much to my surprise told me that my car would be ready that afternoon if I approved the detailed estimate he gave me.  I arrived at the shop and everything was to my satisfaction - the work was done promptly and within the estimate we discussed by phone that morning.

I've gone a long way here to demonstrate a pattern - a pattern of dependable and honest service that I've received from Atwood.  I know cars very well - I have several (and have owned many more) and work on many of them myself and am not someone who could be easily deceived or swayed by a shyster.  Andrew and his crew have always been up-front and straightforward about all the repairs and service I've had done there - often going beyond the call of duty to save me time and money - and I will continue to be a customer for as long as I continue to own european brands."
positive,"The Key Tower stands at 948 feet tall in downtown Cleveland. The Terminal Tower is 771 feet.  People perch by the river valley in Tremont for pictures with the Cleveland skyline in the background. I encourage the reader to venture 10 miles south to Parma, OH and climb 500 feet in elevation to the highlands. There is a beautiful collection of television and radio towers there. Most are taller than the Key Tower and in my estimation it is a far more unique and interesting photo op. Wikipedia says that this grouping of towers is second only to Mount Wilson in LA. I stood at the foot of one of these hulking beasts today and almost lost my balance when I kept moving my neck to see the top. Maybe equilibrium was lost because of the tower transmissions burrowing a hole into my brain. I harken back to one of the greatest films of all time They Live by John Carpenter starring Roddy Piper. The mission of the protagonist was to stop radio towers from programming our population thereby destroying humanity. I am conflicted with the plot because I love these towers so much and would never want any harm done to them. Come check out the towers when you have a chance. Don't worry about RF radiation exposure. You will not be sorry.

positive,Great service and price!  Rob is a very straightforward honest guy!  I started going here awhile back and now I get all muffler work done here
positive,"Got my transmission replaced on my 02 Toyota Corolla. They gave me a great quote, and they even lowered it after talking to them more about my situation. They completed the rebuild very quickly and they communicated with me professionally and often, keeping me informed. They were so kind to me each time I was at the office. They definitely made a stressful situation a lot easier to handle. They have a good warranty, and are very willing to check anything if you think something is up or just for regular check ups on the new transmission. A bit out of the way from me, and not necessarily the best part of town, but I would definitely recommend them!"
positive,"Ok, I thought for awhile about what to say on Yelp about Hondatromics, and came up with a myriad of things.  I really want to keep this as short as possible yet be comprehensive about my feelings toward Hondatronics, and James and Nicole Bean, the owners.

I began taking an Acura RSX-S to Hondatronics (from here on out I will refer to this store as H.T.) when James and Nicole purchased it from Keith Doyle, who opened the store years before.  I was scared when James and Nicole took over as I had a few Acura and Hondas and was always pleased with Keith's work.  H was honest, professional, fair, and amazing. Since the new owners took the reins, H.T. His only gotten better.  On my 2nd visit I witnessed something which James said he honesty doesn't recall.  I lady was at H.T. To pick up her Civic. By the symptoms she outlined, James had prepared hermit the news that she, likely, needed a new transmission; and she was given an estimate of $1,800.  She had the cash in her hand when she entered the store, ready to pay. While waiting for a bit for James to come in from the service bay, we talked.  She said she was a 6th grade teacher, and was not prepared in the least for a new transmission, especially since educators are so seriously under-paid for the job they do. She was not happy, until James came in.  He told her that he was able to CORRECT the problem by seriously cleaning out her gears and changing out the transmission fluid, along with some kind of filter.  Her bill?  She owed H.T. A grand total of $78!!!!!  (And James had already begun apologizing that her bill was THAT much.). Remember that she had $1,800 in her hand, ready to pay!!!  After that visit, my feelings toward H.T., James, and Nicole were confirmed.  I WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, AND DEALING WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

Ok, that was a few years back, but the fact remain the same.  I have been back to H.T. probably 45'times since then.  I have always been treated with professionalism and honestly.  I haven't always liked hearing what James or Nicole have told me regarding what they found wrong or the price to fix it, but not once have I ever questioned their findings or the price to fix it.  They have always been straightforward with me, and always given me a price lower than EVERY other store that specialized in repairing Honda products.  I'm so happy to have found this shop and James and Nicole that I even asked him to repair my Honda lawnmower, but he politely declined .  

THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR SHOP DESERVE THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD, AND HAVE EARNED EVERY CUSTOMER THEY HAVE BY DOING EVERYTHING WITH HONESTY AND INTEGRITY AS THE FOUNDATION FOR THEIR  SUCCESS.  MY CARS WILL FOREVER BE HANDLED BY NICOLE, JAMES, AND HONDATRONICS.  

Recently I pondered the idea of a BMW for my next car.  I quickly changed my mind when James told me he doesn't work on BMWs.  Thanks for all the care and honesty you have shown me and my family over the years.  (And especially for talking me out of the Beemer.)"
positive,"The room is big, comfortable and well designed. Very spacious. I really like the buttons around the bed to open/close the curtains. Little green lights on each light switch so you know where they are in the middle of darkness.

The bed and pillow is a bit too soft for me but I still got a very good sleep.

The major issue is noise. I stayed on the 20th floor but I can hear car with big muffler or bikes cruising down the strip. My room is next to the housekeeping office and the staff likes to talk with the door open. I wish they can use better materials to sound proof the room.

I ate at the Tetsu Teppanyaki restaurant is the food is excellent. The Jean Philipe Bakery right next to the room-access elevators serves crepes, sandwichs, salads, coffee and everything you need for a quick meal. And the chocolate (though overpriced) is very nice.

I didn't play in the casino since I don't gamble but I feel this hotel has much less people smoking compared to others. $15 min for blackjack or roulette bet seems to be the norm there."
positive,"While driving on my way back home my car suddenly stopped in a place. I got out of the car and checked the exhaust pipe but found out nothing was wrong with it. I also tried checking the engine but could find nothing wrong with it. But when Leavitts Auto Care came, they told me in matter of minutes that the problem lay with the transmission machine and gave an instant estimate of my expenditures too. Since then, I have always trusted Leavitts Auto care for any work that involves maintenance and repair of my car. Their mechanics are really very good at diagnosing cars."
positive,Love the YELP check in $7.77 for a smog!!!!  I was in and out in less than 10mins. They were bz too!!!!  My husband brought his car here for check engine light and they told him which part he needed he bought it and they installed it for a decent price !!!! A+++++ service
positive,"We were on a roadtrip from New Orleans to Los Angeles. Vegas was our last stop and right when we literally got on the freeway to go home, my check engine light came on. This was scary because we were from out of town, and what if we went to a local mechanic and they rip us off because knowing we are desperately trying to get home!

Hondatronics saved our butts! We drove up about an hour before closing, and the super nice guy who was there (I forgot his name but I think he was the owner) said he would do the diagnoses of the check engine light. He came out the car and did the check (I drive a 1997 Honda CR-V with over 189,000 miles on it, and of course we had just driven all the way across the country). He said the engine was running lein, but we should be fine to drive all the way back to Los Angeles and turned the light off for us. He didn't mind that we obviously couldn't give him the business, he was just being an awesome nice guy and didn't charge us for anything. We got back fine and I've since had my local mechanic here work on the issue. 

This is a sign of a place you can trust which is why I am writing the review. If you live in Las Vegas and own a Honda, give this place a try!"
positive,I had a minor issue with my muffler. Needed to get it fixed ASAP and I am so ELATED that I stumbled across this shop. My experience was awesome from start to finish. Both Tamara and Phil were helpful and honest. I will not only be a regular customer but will refer anyone and everyone that needs auto work done.
positive,"This review is long overdue! I thought I had already written it, but apparently in the craziness of finals I forgot. Anyways, onto my review...

After driving back from California a couple months ago, my check engine light came on and my car was shaking like crazy. Upon referral from a friend, and after reading all the Yelp reviews, I decided to bring my car (Honda CRV) into Valley Automotive. Boy was I glad I did! I got an initial estimate from KC and his staff, but after doing some work it ended up that there was more wrong with my car than was initially thought. However, rather than me having to pay for the additional fixes, KC offered to foot the bill! I was shocked, but forever grateful! The thing that sets Valley Automotive apart from most other auto shops is they care about their customers and want to do right by them. As a graduate student with little money, I appreciate the honest business and work that KC and his staff do at Valley Automotive. I happily referred a friend to them so she could get a second opinion after taking her car to another shop. Valley Automotive saved her money and she was equally as impressed with the service she received!

Apparently my car doesn't like the Vegas heat (who does like 115 degree weather?!) and I noticed that it is leaking coolant. I will gladly be taking my car back to Valley Automotive and doing business with KC and his team again!"
positive,"I was surprised when I came here because I usually expect to be upsold. Im usually given the song and dance that brakes are bad, shocks are on their last limb yada yada yada. When I came in today Jeff was a straight shooter. Got my oil and transmission fluid changed And he was honest and told me everything was good. They have windows to the shop where you can see the mechanics doing the work. Coffee, donuts and a nice lounge area. I like finding a place I can get work done that's trustworthy and Jeff (the store manager) is friendly and an asset to Big-O."
positive,"Came in with exhaust pipes rusted halfway off, was prepared to replace the whole thing. Guy welded new pipes on just past the muffler. Pipes secured now."
positive,"We've been taken our cars here for years and they've provided excellent service every time. We've serviced our Volkswagen Passat and Jetta here and they've done an honest job. Recently we purchased a used Volkswagen Tiguan and took it in for a $130 full inspection and the owner Frank called me personally and encouraged me to return the vehicle to the dealer due to multiple issues including the transmission which we ended up doing. He didn't charge me at all because they spotted the issues pretty quick into the inspection. I've never seen a mechanic be so honest. 

On another occasion we had a set price set up for a secondary air injector to be installed on my wife's Jetta and it turned out they were able to get a cheaper price on the part needed and lowered the cost that we agreed upon. 

I couldn't be more happy with the honestly and high level of service that Desert Car Care Chandler provides."
positive,"Nobody likes getting their car repaired, especially when the damage was someone else's fault.  These guys did a fantastic job on my Jaguar F-Type.  Casey gave me a comprehensive quote and completed the work right on time.  They made sure to repair it right, replacing the parts that needed to be replaced instead of repairing plastic parts like the insurance quote felt could be done.  I also had them perform a paint-less dent repair while the car was there, and the results are impressive, can't even tell it was there.  Car was nice and clean for pickup.  If you need repairs, stop searching, this is the place."
positive,"These guys rock! Quickest most affordable muffler, exhaust, and service shop around! I've taken them all my vehicles for years and would recommend them to anyone."
positive,"Our Porsche's windshield cracked due to a stone on the road, so the Porsche dealership in Vegas recommended us Chris from AGR Windshields. They got the new windshield ordered (porsche windshield specifically for our GT3 model,) and Chris installed it on a SUNDAY on labor day weekend (talk about service!) we were on a roadtrip so Sunday was the only day we would be in Vegas, so he really did us a huge favor. 
The end result looks amazing, Chris is friendly, professional, and a real detail-oriented guy. We were very nervous about a third party fixing our windshield (although recommended by porsche) but we couldn't be happier and you couldnt even tell we did anything. 5 starts!"
positive,"I have a 1991 VW Westfalia, with a Tiico engine covnersion (water-cooled Jetta engine, installed ""sideways"").

About a week after getting it out of the shop after the new engine was installed, the the pipe that connects to the in-side of the muffler cracked through. I took it to Mesa Muffler and they welded it up. About a month later it cracked in the same place again, and they welded it again.

Later, when my girlfriend backed the muffler into a dirt bank, it cracked the pipe clean through in the same spot. So I took it to a Midas (was out of town - it was my only option), and they installed a new muffler. A few months later the pipe cracked in the original spot. I was back home then, so I took it to a different Midas, and they welded it up, and added a new support bracket. That lasted a couple months, the the pipe cracked in the original spot, and the bracket they added also broke off.

Took it to a different Midas, and they installed a new muffler / bracket assembly, for about $240.00. About 2 weeks later, the entire muffler fell off while I was driving down the highway. :)

So I googled ""high performance muffler,"" and found Scottsdale muffler. Thank god. I spoke with Chris - gave him the whole story, and dropped it off. He called the next day to pick it up, and the bill was $180.00. 

The new muffler / mounting hardware is absolutely a thing of beauty. They fabricated a big flat double-mounting bracket, which is rubber insulated. I could not recommend them more highly!"
positive,"You can't ask for better customer service! I took a transmission here to change it from a 2-wheel drive output shaft to a 4-wheel drive output shaft. The price was very reasonable. Here's where the GREAT customer service came in:  I made a mistake on the type of 4-wheel drive output shaft that I needed for my application. Pete changed out the output shaft at no charge because he had already charged me for the first exchange. With that kind of great customer service, you can't go wrong."
positive,"I am not from the area and needed a check engine light to be looked up before I drove home. These guys took me right away.  I sat in the waiting area for an hour while many happy costumers went through.  JR was very friendly, honest and helpful with everyone.  I heard him tell people when they really needed to get something fixed or when they could put it off.  I even heard him consoling a woman who had just broken up with her boyfriend.  She was most worried that it might also have ended her mechanic relationship. 
In the end he didn't charge me for the engine code look up, and said it was fine to drive on.  He also did a great job explaining why the carburetor wasn't an emergency situation.  I could drive home and just see if it comes back on. They did change my oil, which was overdue, for less money than I usually pay.   
Like the previous reviewer, if I was reviewing a coffee shop I wouldn't give it any stars but this place was the best mechanic experience I have had."
positive,"We were lucky enough to find Quick Muffler this past weekend (they were open on holiday Monday!). Our muffler was in need of repair, and had gone to a big name shop for a quote. It was very high, so we thought we'd check out some other places. That's when we came upon Quick Muffler. They were fast, friendly, polite and half the price of the large chain repair!!! We were in and out in an hour, and were so very thankful. Highly recommend this great place! We will be going back for any of our auto needs from here on! Thanks Abe! You're the best!!"
positive,"Feb 2013 - P.S.  It's almost a year later, and knock on wood, but my transmission is still running fine.  I have not needed a new one yet!"
positive,"We have a 2000 Volvo, check engine light flashing. It turned out to be a complicated problem. At the end of the day Sammy and team came through above and beyond. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is I felt they could have called and kept us updated when they didn't meet their time commitments and It  took 3 different trips to resolve the problem and they didn't ensure the check engine light was turned off after they completed the work. They took care of us given our time and troubles. I felt they went out of there way to make the situation right. Exceptional! We will continue to use them and refer to people to them. Thank you Sammy!"
positive,"I took my car in to repair a dead headlight. The car has some other issues, but I only had an hour and frankly wasn't prepared to pay for the bumper and transmission work that it should probably have. But a missing headlight means tickets from the po-po, so you gotta sort it out.

I left my car with them, walked out of the shop, and realized that I had forgotten to ask how much it would cost. I'm still new to this whole car thing and make amateur mistakes all the time. I came back after an hour expecting to be reamed, but was handed a $19 bill. I know replacing a headlight isn't a big job, but $19 was waaaaay less than I expected. Pretty sweet.

Two days later my girlfriend was being cheeky, asking whether I ever got that broken bumper fixed. Playing along, I told her to look for herself. She knew I hadn't taken it to the shop - she just wanted to rile me up. But then, to my utter disbelief, we found that the bumper HAD been fixed. When Woodies replaced my headlight (for $19) they also reconnected my sagging bumper. They didn't charge me for it; they didn't even brag about it.

What the hell, Woodies. You are too awesome."
positive,"After having a transmission noise that was very difficult to pin down, their tech Andy was able to square away a tough situation. I was almost out of warranty when I initially brought it in, but with the help of Dave Drouin(my service advisor) and Dave Bartlett(Service Manager) it was covered even though it ran well past my warranty expiration in getting it fixed. Dave B in particular was very empathetic and even gives out his cell for texting purposes. Dave D was very prompt in getting me the updates to how my vehicle was doing and I would definitely recommend the dealership. Even Taylor, the loaner vehicle gal was extremely courteous. Once again, can't say enough about tech Andy. He was phenomenal in trying to understand the problem with the trans."
positive,I would highly recommend this dealership based on my recent service experience. The check engine light came on my 2014 Limited and I was getting ready to ride from Phoenix to California. The service rep. (Joe) took care of me. He identified the problem and found the parts at another dealership. Had the parts transferred and installed them in a few hours. They provided me transportation to and from my home. Could not of received better service.
positive,"I hate shops.   I really do.   I have never had a good experience at any auto shop I have ever been to.  I trained myself to work on my own cars so I would never have to deal will shops again. I recently bought a beater truck (1996 Dodge Ram) for work and/or hauling guitar equipment and what-not.   The truck barely moved.  I maybe got to about 30mph and it revved to about 2000....    I couldn't figure out what was wrong, so i limped this green monster to Desert Car Care. I was expecting the usual...  a phone call about an hour later telling me I needed thousands of dollars worth of work on my truck.  Not the case.   They called about an hour later and told me I needed a new battery (which I did) and they gave me the option to buy one my self and bring it to them (the cheaper option) or put one they have there in it ( the easy option).  After that was sorted, they called back again and told me my Catalytic Converters where clogged and needed new ones.  nothing else.   I even made mention of a possible bad transmission (that gave them an opportunity to screw me) and he said no.  the Tranny is fine.  Wow.   I couldn't believe how honest they where.  The truck was done the next day and he called me and told me to come pick up ""Truck-a-saurus"".  When I got there, the mechanic that worked on it talked with me about later work on the truck getting it to 100% as he is proficient in Mopar vehicles.   I will definitely be taking Truck-a-saurus back to Desert Car Care to get him 100%.   Nice work guys.  Keep it up.  This is how a business is supposed to be ran."
positive,"Stop by here whenever I need supplies for my car. It's convenient because it's located near my house and they have plenty of parking. The employees are pretty knowledgeable here and will assist you in installing batteries, windshield wipers, and other easy things that you can buy here if you need help with it. You can also get your battery tested or check engine light scanned for free. Pricing is pretty reasonable on most things and if you shop here a lot make sure to sign up for the rewards card where you get a $20 reward after 5 $20+ transactions in a 6 month period"
positive,"Just a few days ago my transmission started slipping a bit. Then on the 101 it started making some very nasty growling noises. Got into a parking lot and every gear acted like neutral; my transmission was TOAST!

Looked into a lot of different shops and was really starting to question if I should even keep my van or just get a new one because of the high costs everywhere I called for rebuilt transmissions.

I heard about Pete's Transmissions from a trusted mechanic. Because of their reviews on Yelp and a few other places I decided to go for it. 

When I called, Erica answered the phone. She was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions to my satisfaction. When she learned that I drove a van she immediately asked if it was a work van. I said yes and she quickly figured out what it would take to get it done as fast as possible so that I can keep working. My van is my office, warehouse, workshop and lifeblood of my business!

I had my van towed to Pete's Transmissions on a Thursday afternoon. Friday morning Erica called me letting me know I was good to go! Very good turnaround time! My transmission repair included a 12 month warranty and was HALF the cost of most other places I called!

When you show up at Pete's Transmissions it is clear that they know what they're doing and they do it well!
My old van is driving better than ever before!"
positive,I honestly love this muffler shop. I have been to three others and Scottsdale muffler has been on the ball with everything I needed. Not only did they do a stand up job of replacing my piping to 2.25 inches and adding a muffler. I wasn't quite happy with the volume so I bought a new muffler and asked them to replace it. They were more happy to do it and they also continued to update me on the progress. Amazing prices with amazing service. Scottsdale muffler is my muffler shop!
positive,"Great place.  Got a Groupon initially for a year of unlimited oil changes for $35 and it was so worth it.  I go every 3,000 miles and have so far been a half a dozen times.  They are thorough with my car and do an inspection with the oil change.  They gave me free estimates for a leaky transmission and the prices compared just fine with other places in town.  I have subsequently bought a Groupon for my friend as well."
positive,"I found myself needing a new transmission in my 2002 GMC Envoy two weeks before Christmas. I called Pete's and their price was so much lower than other places that I decided it was worth the drive from Mesa. When I called back to let them know I was coming, the transmission they had for me was already sold. Erika had one put together for me. She told me it would be ready at 8. When I showed up at 8, I walked into an office full of random pictures and art. Pete wrote up my paperwork while someone else loaded up the part. The price was exactly what I was told on the phone. I was in and out in 15 minutes. I will definitely recommend Pete's to anyone with transmission needs. This place is a family owned operation that has been done right."
positive,"Very professional and they have fair pricing. They make recommendations that are needed but aren't pushy.  The last time I was in they were able to get me in same day and it was exactly as they had quoted. In addition, they usually are finished before the time they estimated.  I've just stopped by for questions and they were very helpful and even added fluid  or reset check engine light at no cost.  They are super nice there."
positive,"Love this place I needed a new cat for my cadillac, and places were charging me ridiculous amount of money, Jesus and his team took care of me and it was fantastic service I highly recommend this place for anyone with their exhaust or muffler needs!! I will be back!!"
positive,"I have used this auto shop a handful of times and they are always super nice, super helpful and not pushy at all. Last time I was there was for a check engine light, they told me it just needed to be fixed before my next emissions test, which was a year out. It was an expensive fix so I am glad I have time to save up for it. They could have lied, like may auto shops have done before and told me it had to be done sooner than later, but they are honest! Thanks Whitey's!!!"
positive,"I had my truck (2002 Chevy 1500 Auto transmission) fixed at petes, great customer service,  unbelievable price (super low )trust me you will not regret it, the shop looks awesome, 
And they aren't bogged down with other non transmission repairs,
 I will only go to  Petes from now on and refer everyone to Petes transmissions, he will give you a great quote and a great price, I can't say enough good thing about Pete, but you are the man, thanks to Pete and his creww....."
positive,"I'm new to the Phoenix area and had car trouble on the I-17 during rush hour. My check engine light was flashing, which I figured was not good, so I checked Yelp and found Dave's. I chose them because of the reviews and also the fact that it is near my house. They've gained a customer for however long I remain in the area! I took my car in around 10:00am, they said it would be a bit before they could diagnose it, so THEY GAVE ME A RIDE HOME! By noon they called me and told me what was wrong, how much everything would cost, and to my surprise-- that it would be finished before closing the same day. They were friendly and quick. I highly recommend Dave's Car Care! Oh and the actual Dave (the owner) answers the phone at the shop. I thought that was a nice, personal touch."
positive,"""Been here a few times for smog and oil change they seemed pretty honest, so when my check engine light came on in my pathfinder I decided to give them a try. Needed spark plugs. I got a great price with good service. They included my passing smog and free oil change with the repair. The lady at the counter was pleasant and chatty. Good job guys. ""."
positive,"I was involved in a DUI Hit & Run and needed my bumper repaired. Ben R. put me at ease. He even explained to me how paint works differently on metal versus plastic, which is why my bumper is a slightly different shade that my body. I had never noticed, and I had been starting at my bumper a lot in anger over this accident! I'm pleased with his professionalism and speed, I was in and out quickly and feel good about getting my car repaired."
positive,"Everyone from the young lady answering the phone, the gentleman that assigned the technician and the technician Phil that looked at my friend's car were awesome.
We were driving from San Diego to Phoenix to watch some baseball when the check engine light came on and the car began losing power. Did a quick Yelp search and found this place with a solid 5 stars. 
If we could give them 6 stars we would! They diagnosed the car and assured us we were ok to finish up our trip just be sure we have the car fixed when we get home.
Thank you everyone at Litchfield Auto Repair!!"
positive,"In Solon on business and desperate for good food, I had the good fortune to stumble upon ""Harvest Kitchen and Lounge"".  I went back the next night.  And if I hadn't flown out the next morning I'd have been back again.  

On a busy stretch of road lined with muffler shops and fast food franchises (read ""food like substance"") it would be easy to miss Harvest Kitchen.  (I did and doubled back.)  You park out back and enter through the rear (that's where the hostess is).  The high ceilinged dining room is decorated in soothing colors.  Very airy, very well lit, and not over-chilled - no sweater needed.  It's a handsomely appointed establishment

Harvest Kitchen has fish, foul and red meat; pasta and vegetarian selections, a long list of enticing appetizers and a above average wine list.  I would say the menu's organizing principle is something like ""north Ohio locavore"".  They collect as many ingredients locally as possible, they even found an Ohio made pasta.  It shows in the taste.  I had the saffron angel hair pasta with shrimp, chorizo and vegetables the first night; the tomatoes, spinach and shallots really dressed it up.  The ginger shrimp and sesame noodles (with peas, tomatoes, basic and curry) was equally enticing.  

Harvest Kitchen and Lounge is Hands down the best restaurant in Solon Ohio.  That's not saying much, but Harvest Kitchen would generate positive notice anywhere - in Solon (an unexceptional, distinction free suburb southeast of Cleveland) it's a real stand-out.  Next time I'm in Solon I'll eat there every night - no point in looking further afield.  

Harvest Kitchen would rate at least four stars in any urban center.  But it a distant suburb like Solon it's five stars for sure."
positive,"I was referred to T Jay's by a colleague after a fender bender and was very happy with the service. 

Very friendly and professional. Their customer service was excellent - going above and beyond most businesses to accommodate me. The car looks and drives perfectly.

if you ever need your car repaired, I highly recommend checking them out."
positive,"Have had my oil changed here for years now on several cars. Always a thorough fluids/filters check. Basic stuff is priced right, but upgrades and some bigger flushes and systems services are a tad pricey.

I just happened to stop in today for an oil change after coming directly from the Cadillac dealership. Had been having trouble with a check engine light, rough acceleration, and a nasty rattling noise. 

Somehow the dealership could find nothing wrong and it drove fine for them, yet it rattled and ran rough straight out of their parking lot as I was leaving. Decided to go for an oil change and fluid check at Terrible's. Was in and out in about 30 mins. Surprisingly, it ran so smooth on the way home and didn't rattle either. My guess is the tech must have reconnected something that fell loose - maybe a vacuum line or ECM connection?? 

Either way, great job today as usual. I also come here regularly for car washes. 
TIP: if you buy a car wash at the pump (which you probably need anyways), it knocks off .20¢ per gallon on the gas price. Hard to beat."
positive,"Awesome service and very professional employees that are very helpful, first time here with my bmw, had my srs light and check engine light diagnosed, and also my oil changed. Eddie really knows his stuff, thought this place was too good to be true with complete 5 stars rating but it lived up to its reviews as you can see, would recommend this place to everyone who has a German or euro car."
positive,"I brought my e92 335i in to BMW for a check engine light. Jesse has worked on this car before and each and every experience is outstanding: always knowledgeable, always prompt, and the job is done right.  I won't let anyone else work on my cars. Good, honest techs do exist in Vegas!"
positive,"I have to tell Yelp about CARS. I am grateful for their quick, professional service and their awesome prices. I recently had the transmission on my 2006 BMW M6 go Bye Bye the hard way (pics attached) and CARS was there to get my car on the road again. I also had a 2001 BMW 740i that had a bad engine that needed to be replaced as well as some suspension work. I had a complete suspension rebuild kit and BC Coilovers installed. That along with a new engine installed at CARS have made my 01 Silver Bullet just like new. I couldn't be more happy with the results. 

Armando was the lead mechanic ( to my knowledge) on both cars and I have to give him a BIG THANK YOU. Moe is one of the owners and the gentlemen I worked with most. He is very fair and understanding and I would encourage any one that wants A+ work done but doesn't want to pay Desert BMW prices to call Moe. Eddie works the front desk and is always a delight to talk to. The whole shop has a very warm and inviting atmosphere as you would expect from a professionally run , family owned and operated business. I almost can't wait for my next major mechanical failure to go back and see them again.  Thank you all."
positive,"I had my check engine light come on and took it here. But it just ended up being the gas cap. I should've taken it to autozone first for a free diagnostic test rather than being charged almost $60. I called them again on a different occasion for regular oil change, but was told nobody does the regular oil change anymore and everyone offers the synthetic oil change anywhere I'd take my car to (which is not so true...) the oil change price is a little more than what you can get else where. I recommend Groupon for oil change"
positive,"I unfortunately had to get my car repaired twice in three years when I lived in Cleveland. Fortunately, Excalibur did the job, which minimized the hassle. This auto shop was recommended by my auto insurance, Geico. They had great service, explained everything and kept me updated, and made all the necessary repairs efficiently. They also vacuumed the inside of my car, which was a nice bonus. It was good to have the piece of mind, knowing that they would take good care of my car. 

The only issue I ran into, a few years later, was finding out that they didn't replace the rear bumper quite right, so there is an area where it doesn't attach as securely as it should. It does not affect the function of my car, but if I ever need to get the bumper replaced again (hopefully not anytime soon), I'll have to find a shop to do it correctly."
positive,"My car is old and on the verge of death.  The muffler fell off and I needed to remain road legal, so I came in and was helped extremely quickly without an appointment.  The gentleman showed me under my car and explained all the issues I had clearly, and gave me options.  What's more, he didn't try to oversell or lie to me to make a few extra bucks.

The price was fair, and I only had to wait around half an hour while they replaced my muffler.  I left without a hole in my wallet, and with a clear picture of what was going on with my car and roughly how long I had.  Very satisfied, and would return here."
positive,"I don't know much about cars or anything car related. I know that the vehicle I'm driving is getting on in years and is getting to the point where I'm worried if it will last. Found Liberty through Yelp and I am grateful for all your reviews as they held true.

I took it here to see what could be done with the check engine light. I was taken care of by Rashid. His service was quick, courteous and quite educational. I was given a decent quote for the service but had to decline due to lack of funds. He made me a deal that I might take him up on next time when I come back. Instead I just got my oil changed - about an hour or so wait which was great timing for lunch at L&L next door. We had some good conversation and I enjoyed my experience. Will probably be back soon."
positive,"I purchased my Nissan at Planet Nissan and that location has no idea what they're doing. I've had my transmission replaced twice with them and it was no fun. After I got my transmission fixed I went to Autonation to get a second opinion and since then everything has been great. I'm not going anywhere else. My advisor Chris is awesome! He knows what needs to be done and he makes it happen! 
I will continue to go Autonation for my oil changes and car repairs! Great job guys!"
positive,"Schorier was great to work with.  They fixed my check engine light / replaced my fuel pump that another repair shop installed incorrectly. They even offered to answer any of my hubby's questions since he wasn't able to be there.  They explained everything, were friendly and not pushy.  Would definitely return again."
positive,They were super nice. And I love this place but the prices are really expensive. I know you pay more at the dealership but the transmission tune up will be 400$ that is more than my monthly payment. That is why more people don't have VW.
positive,Ethical and expert. CM owns the best transmission shop in Phoenix. Ask him to blow the horns on his custom Beetle.
positive,"Finally, an honest mechanic!  Had my car towed to this shop three weeks ago after having thrown a tire rod and was quoted a fair amount for further repairs. Took my car in today and watched them turn down working on a transmission because there was nothing wrong with it!!!  What?!  Also, a discount for veterans...yay!  Great staff, thorough work and honest pricing!"
positive,"I was impressed! I had a coupon for a part synthetic oil change for under $20 (great deal). I know my car, so I know when people are trying to sell you BS repairs, I didn't get anything pushy here, just a rec to change the transmission fluid (which is accurate) only downside is that they are very busy on a Saturday. No appointment, you are leaving your car there all day. But hey, being busy is a good sign right? Also, appts have to be made DAYS in advance, not the day before like I tried."
positive,"My ""change oil"" light was on and I knew that I have been driving around too long.  I dreaded going and having to wait a long time.  I was passing by and seen the ""now open"" sign.  I drove up and services was quick!  The staff was very professional and Conner was attentive to our needs and concerns about the type of oil we were wanting.  We will be back to have our transmission fluid change!  Thank you"
positive,"While I did not actually get work done on my vehicle, I can attest that these guys are trustworthy. My vehicle's transmission began slipping several days ago. With some online research of my car (ford exploder), I feared the worst. Sure enough, Kevin from Park Auto called me and gave the bad news that my trans had failed and explained why. While his price quote to fix the problem seemed competitive to what others have paid for this repair, I decided that the it was not worth fixing the vehicle. Kevin also did a full inspection of the vehicle and agreed that with everything else that was about to need repair on the vehicle, it was probably not worth keeping the vehicle. 

Perhaps the best thing to happen in this crappy situation was that Park Auto declined to charge me for an inspection because Kevin stated they did not believe that charging every chance you get is how you keep returning customers. So just with that alone, they have earned my business next time I am inevitably in need of car repair. Good work Park Auto Clinic!"
positive,"My grandfather is a Ford dealer, but his shop is 2 hours away. Needless to say, I don't trust many people to work on my car (as I've been screwed by other dealers in the past!), but sometimes I just can't make the drive.

So when my friend Les noticed that my car was leaking transmission fluid (!!!) this weekend, he told me to call Kayser for an appointment. They were very friendly (no dumb girl treatment) and got me in as soon as they could. Thankfully everything was under warranty and didn't cost me anything. They had my car ready in less than a day. I would definitely take my car back to them."
positive,"Allstate Transmission and Auto Repair Inc., is the only transmission shop I trust to have my fleet of Ford E350 vans maintained and repaired. 

They explain your options and work hard to get it right the - first time! They give you accurate estimates of the cost and the time it takes to work on your vehicle. I am glad to know that quality comes at a reasonable price!"
positive,"Tempe transmission went above and beyond to help solve my transmission problem and did it reasonably fast keeping me informed all the way.
I strongly recommend them for any owner of heavy duty pick up truck that has transmission problems"
positive,"I backed into my trash can and bent the muffler, I also needed an oil change. Henry was so helpful and they were very accommodating, had me in and out within an hour, and I was able to work on my laptop as they had a desk and free Wi-Fi. Exactly what a busy lady needs. I'll be coming back for sure!!"
positive,"Going to a new mechanic to get your car repaired shouldn't rank up there with public speaking and first dates, but it usually does.  Well not if you go visit Tim at Walter's.  They guys at Walter's are friendly, trustworthy, and treat you with respect.

They are a small shop so call ahead if you need major service, but where else are you going find a mechanic who actually suggests way to save money on the repair"
positive,"My family and I pushed my 2009 Nissan Altima pretty hard from San Francisco to Las Vegas and about 70 miles outside of Vegas, my transmission went into safe mode. Needless to say my family was beyond stressed out about this. The next day I took it into Nissan and Dario and his team were Phenomenal! I explained my situation and he really with the extra mile. I can't say enough great things about Dario and my overall satisfaction with the customer service, professionalism, and efficiency of this branch. My family and I thank you for making our experience in Las Vegas and enjoyable one and not a stressful one. Thank you!"
positive,"We tried it based on Yelp reviews, and are we ever glad that we did!  My husband ordered the Pad Thai and asked for level 3 and the Papaya Salad at level 5 - ""Thai hot"".  I ordered the sauteed vegetables with garlic sauce (came with rice on the side) at heat level 3.  We loved what we ordered, although I will admit that next time I will order heat/spiciness level 2 for myself.  I have to commend them:  the spiciness was not just ""hot for hot's sake"", but had real depth of flavor.  I will also say that the mango smoothie we had for dessert was the perfect calming point for my palate.  The restaurant was peaceful, lovely.  We were at a bench/table.  One really neat feature:  There was a large group dining in the side area and there are pivoting glass divider panels that the staff used that really cut down on sound transmission.  What a great thing to have.  I agree with other postings, it is not inexpensive, but I thought it was good value for the quality of food, service, ambiance and location.  We will return the next time we are near Bally's"
positive,"Honest mechanics and they do more than just transmissions. Jim has replaced my clutch, brakes and fixed a dying water pump. This is a relatively new location but they have been in business for over 30 years in Las Vegas. I send all my girl friends here because I know they won't get screwed over. Highly recommended!!"
positive,"Small family owned shop but great at what they do (dad and brother both retired so now it's just Kevin I believe). We've had Kevin work on our VW Beetle for a few things and couldn't be happier. Super, honest, great guy. We were having a transmission slipping issue and called/visited several places. Those that would actually work on VWs said I'd need a new/rebuilt transmission. Called Kevin up and have him there basics and he was like ""oh yeah, it's probably doing this and this right?... I know exactly what wrong. It's probably just a valve body that needs to be replaced. See it all the time. You shouldn't need a new transmission."" Ran me about $1750 instead of the $3500-5000 I was quoted for a whole new transmission by several other places. Had it done in like 2 days. Even called me a week or so later to find out how it was running and if everything was still ok! Had something else wrong where he looked at it, said he THINKS it's X which would run several hundred dollars, but wanted another day to take a second look if I was ok with it. Called me the next day, said he finally found the issue and it was small, only like $150 give or take. Extremely honest and trustworthy. The only down side is he doesn't take credit cards (or at least didn't when I had my work done). But I'll figure out a way to pay cash or check to an honest, good mechanic over credit to a questionable/unknown one any day."
positive,I was really happy with this restaurant! We stumbled upon this when we were getting our car repaired and decided to stop and enjoy lunch. There were about a half dozen folks in there during the lunch hour and everyone seemed to be a mix of business and local families. Initially the service was really slow I'm not sure they were fully staffed but further into the lunch hour more employees showed up and everyone was a delight. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it! I recommend the shrimp!
positive,I recently took my car to National for a check engine light issue.  I was on a tight timeline due to the fact that I needed to pass emissions and register my vehicle.  They replaced my computer and took my vehicle through emissions to guarantee that there were no issues.  I am thrilled that they completed my work on time and for a great price.  I will definitely return again.
positive,Guys at Cars NV are awesome heard nothing but great things about the shop.  Brought my Mkv Gti in because the check engine light was on and the car was running sluggish.  They located the problem and fixed it quickly and for a great price!  My Gti runs so good now!  Pulls like a freight train again.  What really won me over about Cars NV was the amazing customer service & price.  Thank you Cars NV crew for the great service and experience see you guys next month for my timing belt/water pump install.
positive,"Excellent work at a very good price from this clean,  professional shop. Jesus had me in and out in 20 minutes. Outfitted my 1984 F150 with a  new high quality truck muffler that I would be unable to find at the price I paid anywhere else.  Glad I traveled all the way from  Cave Creek to  this great  shop.  Thank you,  Jesus!"
positive,"Hey trust me when i tell you....you will receive 5 star treatment at this midas on Bell road. Located only about 1 min off SR51 here in phoenix...it is you one stop destination for everything that is ailing your car, truck, van, SUV, or motorcycle. I remember when I first moved out here in Feb..I had some serious issues going on with my 1999 Jeep Cherokee classic. My wife and sister-in-law drove our Jeep from Chicago Illinois, more than 2000 miles, and I have to say it made it all the way with no troubles to speak of. 

However upon arriving in Arizona, i noticed a few days later that the check engine light was on....and i knew i needed to rectify any problems i was having with the Jeep before i took it for it's emission test out here. Well to make a long story short...being new out here i didn't know who to trust to fix my Trucks....also own a 2004 Chevy Colorado....and i had heard some true horror stories about how car mechanics try to swindle you out of thousands of dollars out here.

So since i needed an Oil change i decided to go to Midas and at least get that done since they were offering to rotate the tires as well all for only 19.99. While i was there i had them check out the check engine light...and check for anything else that was wrong with the Jeep  again before i took it for the emission test. I have to tell you it was the best decision i have made for my trucks since i arrived here. 

Bob Ostercamp who is the manager at this location has consistently given my great deals on all my automotive repairs. He is honest, direct, straightforward, and most importantly he cares how your vehicle runs. He has a great staff of certified mechanics and you can trust they will always do the very best job. This location gets a lot of repeat business because of all these factors.

So if your ever in need for honest, reliable, and great service please visit these guys...i promise you...you won't be sorry. Take Care my friends!!!!!"
positive,"I took my Beetle in because the check engine light was on. I scheduled it in the morning and they gave me a lyft home. They ended up changing and sensor and when the car was done they offered to get me a ride back to the shop. That night the light when off again and I called them in the morning and they scheduled an appointment with me at my conscience. The second day they gave me rides, just like the first day. It turns out a second sensor needed to be changed and they didn't charge me at all. The people who worked there treated me like family. Car troubles can be such a pain but with them it went so smoothly. I would highly recommend them."
positive,"My late-model BMW had a couple issues, because it'd been stored while I was in Europe for a couple months.  The battery had died, and the check engine light (""Service Engine Soon"") was on.  You can't get a car registered in Clark County with a check engine light on.  I took it to the dealer thinking it was all pretty routine.  The service rep at the dealer quoted me an eye-popping price just to change the oil and diagnose the problem (I'm talking hundreds, just to change the oil and diagnose my electical/emission problem), and I told him no way and drove away ticked off.  

On the recommendation of a friend, I called Fred.  He gave me a next-day appointment.  The place doesn't look like much, but Fred met me in the parking lot, listened to the problems, offered me a bottle of water, and said he'd have his guys dig into it.  3 hours later, my car was perfect again, and I paid less than half of what the dealership wanted.  Oil changed, problem fixed (corrosion on a connection), and check engine light reset.

But here's the kicker.  There was an issue where Fred said, ""You might have X problem (electrical/emission), and if so, it's going to be expensive to fix.  But we did Y, and l think it's OK now.  So drive it a bit, and if the check engine light stays off after a week, it's fixed; if not, bring it in.""  

3 months later, the car is 100%, and Fred's honesty saved me hundreds compared to the dealer.  Check engine light has not come back on, and I passed the smog check.

Changing the oil on a late-model BMW is a PITA if you do it yourself.  And the dealer charges a fortune.  Family Auto Care is about 60% of dealer cost and only about 10% higher than DIY, assuming you have the little special tools.  Fred uses BMW-spec oil and buys it by the barrel.  You can't beat that when doing the oil yourself, because the oil is spendy.  I ran the numbers and decided it's cheaper for me to have Fred change my oil than to do it myself.  Needless to say, we're talking about half the dealer cost.

You gotta have a reliable mechanic if you own a car you want to keep.  This hole-in-the-wall gets my thumbs up."
positive,"My baby decided to have transmission problems the same time my back went out.  Big Jim (and yes he is as big as his name) was more than willing to work with me.  He came highly rated from my mechanic.  
Now my baby runs better than ever before.  And it was half the cost of taking my car to a dealership for repair. - don't go anywhere else.  I learned my lesson"
positive,"Well it is a Midas.  Both myself and girlfriend have had work done on our cars here.  They are pretty honest and fair about prices and trying to help you out when it will be a large job.  They actually show you the parts and why it is bad. Paul the manager works almost all the time, and you can tell he cares about the location.

Small cons are the oil changes seem to be routine given the price and what is listed as the ""checks"".  Also our car was taken in with a check engine light and a specific part that would have cost $400 to fix at Midas.  After looking on Autozone.com the part was found for $70 and installed with one screw.  They had it listed as an hour part.  I was not happy to find this out.

Overall though one of the more honest repair shops."
positive,"I took my Beetle in because the check engine light was on. I scheduled it in the morning and they gave me a lyft home.

Car troubles can be such a pain but with them it went so smoothly. I would highly recommend them. 

Update: I took my car in again for something completely different but just like the first time the staff was really nice. If I could I would write them another review because this is a genuine group of people!"
positive,"The 'check engine' light went on in my Jeep, and after taking it to AutoZone to have the code read they told me there was a problem with my transmission. I called Allstate because they had such good reviews and they definitely did not disappoint. They got me in the very next morning, and even though the problem was actually not the transmission they explained what was wrong and told me where to go to have it fixed. He spent extra time to make sure I understood what was going on so that when I went to the dealership they wouldn't take advantage of me. Such great service, and I really appreciated them!"
positive,"I was on a road trip to Las Vegas from San Diego knowing I had 1000 miles left. I had my vehicle serviced about a month prior and clearly was not topped off during my service. I failed to get it topped off before my trip my mistake. I had several warning signs my car won't start once I run out of fluid. I came to autonation in Las Vegas and Jeffrey Lopez service consultant was so helpful and kind. He told us exactly how much to buy and showed my husband how to fill the tank. 

Jeffrey made our day and gave my husband recommendations on golf courses. He provided superior customer service and turned a unhappy customer to a happy one! He deserves kudos from management!!!

Not often to find a pleasant, happy to be at work on a Saturday very often!!!"
positive,"I had my car repaired here through my insurance. Had heard horror stories about repair/rental places not keeping you updated so as to trick you into paying for rental longer and other hidden fees. As you can imagine I was on edge going in, but to my surprise everyone was extremely friendly and quick! It was no hassle for me whatsoever and they kept me up to date on the progress of the repairs and let me know as soon as it was done! Would definitely come back for future fixes! Everyone I dealt with was professional and very friendly!"
positive,Thank you Tony and Noe for your great service. I took my 2004 Ford Explorer to Tony with a transmission problem. He was able to fix it and was able to have it ready before I left to California as a special request.  He was such a great help.  So honest and respectful. I won't think twice in coming  here for my next car repair.
positive,So I got screwed buying a car on Craigslist and ended up having transmission issues right off the bat. I brought my car into allstate transmissions and they diagnosed my vehicle for free with no appointment. Turned out it needed a complete transmission rebuild. They completed the repairs a day earlier than expected and they did a great job. Sadly the light came back on the next day but I brought it back in and they corrected the issue immediately. Thank you Mitch Nicole and Jeff for all your help. I will definitely recommend your shop to anyone I know needing transmission work.
positive,"I have taken multiple vehicles here at the recommendation of Curt from Shadow Mountain Automotive.  I was extremely pleased with Bill and State to State.  I've also sent my secretary here as well, and she had the same experience I did.  Bill has never steered me wrong, and he always does right by me.  I am just about to leave to go take another truck to him to get a brand new transmission... It is such a good feeling to know that you have a transmission shop that you can trust, that will be fair with you.  Thanks Bill, for the old school service/business ethics."
positive,"Came here for the second time to get several vaccines for an upcoming international trip. First, the lady on the phone who I talked to when scheduling was very helpful. She explained how the process worked, and was very supportive in squeezing my partner and myself into a single appointment. 

Upon arrival the building is inside of a strip mall. The waiting room is quite large and very clean, with lots of informational brochures and an informational video on vaccines playing on the TV. We were directed to check in on the computers in the lobby (which for me, was a refreshing change compared to filling out five pieces of paper for the registration paperwork). 

We were quickly escorted back to see the nurse practitioner who was also incredibly friendly. She walked us through what our options were, and even was prepared to offer advice on prophylactic steps to avoid food/water and mosquito transmitted illnesses. This is a great resource for the average person, and I am glad it is offered, however, I think it should be an OPTION. I am one month from being a physician, and did my own research on what vaccines I did and did not need, and the transmission of diseases is not anything new...so it would be nice if you could call and get an appointment just for the vaccines you need instead of having to pay for an appt. with a nurse practitioner. Again, it's a great service, do not get me wrong, but it should be optional. 

We were then given our vaccines and prescriptions and sent on our way. Travel vaccines can be VERY VERY VERY expensive (it is not that they are expensive here, they are expensive in general). We easily spent over $1300. So make sure that you have good insurance to reimburse you before you go or be prepared to pay a lot of money out of pocket. They do not bill insurance/take insurance, so you must pay and then be reimbursed. 

Overall, a great experience, and I'd recommend this place to anyone with international travel plans."
positive,"We've had our 2003 Boxster S into Beck's twice for some major work, and I have to say I've never had such a positive experience with a repair shop! Their prices are extremely reasonable, and they do excellent work. 

When we had a problem with 2nd gear on our transmission, the dealership and another shop I called wanted me to replace the whole tranny (about $5-7k!!) but Beck's realized it was a common problem and not a difficult fix for their technicians (the guy who worked on my car had spent 5+ years as a factory tech in Stuttgart!).

Their office staff is friendly, the mechanics will come out and explain what they are doing, and the owner Frank is always good about calling if there are any unforeseen problems. Contrast that with the Porsche Dealer in town, I couldn't get the time of day from their ""service managers"" because I wasn't driving a brand new Porsche.

I've also referred a friend for his BMW M3, he said Beck's charged him much less than the dealership for a major repair, and did a great job. If you own a BMW or Porsche and don't take it to Beck's, you're doing it wrong!"
positive,"I don't have a BMW, neither do I have a ton of money to put into my Nissan Maxima, but I did want to get my check engine light, smog and brake issues resolved before giving up on this car I bought that I thought was a good deal. After having to spend too much money on an ignition cylinder lock at the dealer, and then told to not bother tying to fix the other issues, but buy another car, I had to find another way. Then I found Lee. I didn't think it would be practical to fix everything, but to my surprise, not only did Lee fix more than I asked (everything), he did it for way less than what the Nissan dealer would have charged (if they had the will to do it), and he did it pretty quickly. It's great to have a mechanic who knows what he's doing, and who doesn't lie or cheat, but treats you with honesty, respect and delivers top notch expertise."
positive,"Thanks to Alan and the crew for getting my truck running smooth! They fixed my transmission and drive shaft, you can barely feel the gears shift. Don't hesitate to bring your truck or car here, I was from out of town and went here on a recommendation. My truck now runs better than it ever did!!"
positive,"An update to my previous review-  this time we worked with Andrew in the service department, he took the time to really check out what was wrong and did a transmission program update and flushed the transmission fluid, and tried to really see what he could do to fix the possible problems. The car is running much better, and hopefully these problems will not present themselves again- so thank you Andrew. 
As a customer, this is what I think should happen in the first place instead of having to come back several times for the same problem."
positive,"I had some car issues, thinking it was the transmission, I dropped my car off on Sunday. They called me monday, with an exact diagnosis of what was wrong (throttle position sensor), they charged me nothing and told me how to replace it by myself. Saved me HUNDREDS of dollars. Thank you guys."
positive,"Broken down in Vegas...sounds like a good country-western song until you live it...towed in your RV.  Great staff, extremely competent and reasonably priced repair of a transmission problem in our Rialta that another car repair company had created.  Love the friendly atmosphere, and we'll be coming back for services in the future."
positive,I just purchased a 1970 GMC C1500 and I knew the transmission needed rebuilt. Bill and his crew took care of it at a decent price. Truck is running fantastic. They fixed everything the previous owner destroyed and even through in some extras. Thanks Bill!
positive,"State to State was recommended to me by another mechanic for my transmission needs.  (A trusted mechanic is the best guy to ask for a referral!)  I first took my 2010 Ford F150 to State to State for a leaky transmission.  Bill's guys fixed the issue quickly and affordably.  Next, I took my 1968 Corvette in for a total transmission rebuild and clutch replacement.  Again ...  All fixed quickly, perfectly and affordably.  I give State to State Transmission my highest recommendation for all of your transmission needs!"
positive,A blessing!  My check engine light came on as I was driving into work one morning.  I pulled off 485 and drove to the nearest garage and it was Manchester.  The place is very clean and the guys are super friendly.  The customer service is outstanding.  They even were able to drop me off at work and then picked me up once my car was done!  I really felt they had my best interest at heart.  Highly recommended.
positive,Tom Hal and Glenn these guys are rockstars they worked with me when my transmission went out on my 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe now I'm the proud owner of a 2009 Nissan cube I will definitely do business with them again
positive,On more than one occasion they have been helpful and honest. One time I went in with an airbag sensor issue. They told me they could fix it but that the vehicle had a recall and the dealer would fix it for free. Another time I went in with some transmission issues. I did tell them if it was the transmission I would not repair the car but instead put the money into a new one. They drove my vehicle and determined it was my transmission along with brakes and other problems. They agreed it was a very expensive fix and didn't charge me to look at the vehicle. I will now be purchasing a new vehicle that will have a warranty but as soon as it expires I'm headed back to tuffy for any service it will need.
positive,"Went to these guys because my check engine light was on and my gas gauge wasn't working. They said we needed a new fuel pump. They had my jeep for about 4hrs and called and said they found broken wires near the gas pump, which was causing the light to go off. Basically, our bill went from 600$ to 110$. They could've been greedy and not replaced it and still charged us the 600$. All in all, great customer service. Honest, hard working people."
positive,Was getting the run around from the insurance company I had to deal with to get my car repaired and these guys completely took care of those annoying phone calls and did great repair work on my car. Thanks so much for everything guys! Especially Derrick!
positive,"I had come down here since, my Honda CRV brake pads were spoilt and I had a noisy drive everywhere I went. Though it was a walk-in for the service, somehow I could get the car repaired after 4 hrs of wait. Anyways, appreciate for without an appointment and getting it done so fast on time."
positive,"Bill is honest & very knowledgeable. He helped me retrieve my transmission's error codes. So, I could make a claim to the dealership. Who repeatedly denied an obvious transmission problem. I was then able to receive warranty coverage. Bill saved me thousands of dollars & didn't even charge me for the diagnosis. Bill restored my faith in the auto service industry. His pride in workship should be applauded & an example to all who just want to get paid."
positive,"I had excellent professional work done by Underground Diesel.  They installed a new upgraded transmission cooler, Banks techo intercooler, banks automind tuner and a complete brake upgrade.  They truck runs amazing and the brake upgrade was better than expected. There labor and parts pricing was excellent.  Will be back for more work in the future.  Highly recommend!"
positive,"Whitey's is great. Brought my car in for a transmission repair in the morning and they had it done ahead of schedule that evening. The technician also went as far as to offer removing the transmission oil from the bill as they had forgotten to add it to the original quote. Great, honest company and staff that offers their services at a reasonable price. If your in need of auto repair this is most certainly my first suggestion."
positive,Everyone knows how difficult it is to find a trustworthy mechanic.  I just had my 2010 Camry serviced today at Precision Imports and I will definitely return.  I paid about half of what the dealer quoted and most importantly I trust the honesty and expertise from Precision.  They serviced the transmission and radiator using OEM fluids and did the job right. These guys are true professionals and were very committed to pleasing this customer. Thanks!!
positive,"After my car broke down in the desert and I faced a gazillion dollar tow charge, I had the wonderful fortune of finding Cars Complete Auto Repair online and rated well on Yelp. They deserve their rating. A wonderful group all around. Caesar was my mechanic. He immediately pulled the top off my motor so that I could see my timing chain and more were slack and screwed. The reason, it turned out, that my timing belt was screwed was because my previous mechanic hadn't torqued down a bolt and it had literally fallen off. Caesar not only made all repairs for a good price but saved all the bad parts for me so that I could confront the bad mechanic...then he called the bad mechanic and vouched for the problem. That didn't do any good, but I appreciated his help very much. Lastly, he referred me to Performance Muffler for a great muffler job.  The least I could do was write them a great Yelp review, and I will bring them my future business. Thanks Caesar! And all the other folks who helped out. (No, they are not the cheapest probably, but they are fair and do exactly what they say.)"
positive,"I have been coming here for smogs, oil changes & basic maintenance after my free dealership oil changes for 1st 2yrs expired with my current vehicle. 2013 Honda Civic. 3yr 8mo now. Obviously, the $7.77 smog check is the best deal anywhere in the city.  Marlene at the front runs a smooth operation. The wait area is fairly small. 5 chairs I believe? A coffee machine, restroom & TV.
I have had 5 oil changes done here in 41.5mo. And smog checks required for car registration annual renewals. So 10 visits thus far. My car uses full synthetic which costs more. USA's price is comparable to other places. I have the type of car that tells you when oil needs changing & other basic maintenance. Usually it says to get tire rotation same time as oil change. Which are typically complimentary. Since my car oil changes seem fairly consistent at about every 8mo. I was not sure if the car's just saying it at regular intervals, the wear has just been consistent or the indicator says 0% oil life before it gets really dirty. I decided to ask a mechanic here what the condition of my oil was. He said I probably could have gone a bit longer before a change. So I asked if it was dirty enough to require a change. He said yeah. You can interpret that how you want.
Like many of these auto convenience shops, they do a complimentary inspection of car for preventive maintenance. As you can see on the reviews, there's both good & bad experiences. It should be noted, shops are known to upsell unnecessary services. So one should do their own due diligence. You don't need to be an expert mechanic. But it's good to have at least a basic knowledge of car maintenance or know someone who does. I fall in the former category, emphasis on basic. Check your car manual or it's easy to google anything one does not know. Isn't the internet a great thing?
My experiences here have been mixed. Some services I have been recommended were needed and some were not or not yet. Which is the point of 'preventive' maintenance, with exception of services not needed at all or any time soon. A few like changing engine & cabin air filters are easy to do by one's self.(Filters which I buy at O'Reilly's: see my review for them). Watched YouTube, did it in under 5min. Had transmission fluid changed & fuel injectors/throttle body cleaned 2 visits ago May 2018. To be fair, the mechanic(can't recall name) did say they were not in bad shape but should be done in near future. I did not notice any problems, so it may have been early. But I figured my car was almost 5yrs old 45k mi without having either done ever. And I was offered a deal to get both done so I had them do it.
Last visit Jan 2019 for most recent oil change & tire rotation. I was recommended air & cabin air filter change(was near recommended change time), front brake pads low(started squeaking a few weeks ago), fuel injector cleaning(odd since they did that 8mo 7k mi ago, with no noticeable fuel economy change before & after the service. And I only use Top Tier fuel to boot). So they should be fairly clean. Side note: Top Tier gas at Arco & Costco happen to also be some of the cheapest places to fill up, at least in the SW. I said I could change air filters myself. Asked how much left on brake pads. They said don't need to be done right now, but soon for sure. So I replaced air filters myself later on. Will get the front brake pads replaced soon. Doubtful fuel injectors need cleaning any time in the near future.
Overall I would recommend USA. Especially for the smog check. Just double check on recommended services, as one should with any place you take your car to be serviced."
positive,"Took my wife's 2008 550i in today for intermittent check engine light and what I thought was suspension issue. I wasn't very thorough in explaining symptoms as I'm not a mechanic but Nathan was patience with me.  Kameron called me and explained the issue with check engine and provided recommendations for other items they found but did not push repairs on me.  I like the fact that part numbers and labor hours are clearly listed on invoice and estimate.  I only have budgeted for certain repair costs so I didn't do all the recommended items.  I was very surprised that they wash my car and cleaned the interior.  I will return to complete other recommended items.  First class service at reasonable prices.  Thanks Kameron and Nathan, you've gained another customer."
positive,"Synopsis :  Professional and affordable service. The people there are friendly and honest and will take the step further to make everything exceptional. 

I bought a 1998 Honda Accord from craigslist. My check engine light turned on about two weeks after buying the car. (Obviously I'm no car genius) Took it into auto zone to check the light and the guy there mentioned Mak Automotive Service. Didn't think much of it. Talked to an acquaintance that comes to my work and he too mentioned to take it here. Too much of a coincidence in my opinion to have two people the same day tell me where to go. So I did. 

Walk in and I'm greeted by a smile. Very professional yet still with a personality. (I say this because sometimes when I talk to people in a business type scenario it's like talking to a cardboard cutout.) Something that I noticed is that everything was clean and organized. Even the bathroom was clean. 
Left the car there to get checked over. Calls me back saying that it has a factory defect and that Honda won't cover it because it's over the warranty. Gives me a price quote. I lie and tell him to give me a few minutes see if I can come up with the money. So I check the internet, turns out he was right about it and my Honda did have a factory defect. Call in a few other top rated yelp places and Honda and get quoted at least 70 dollars more. I get the job done and my Honda purrs like a cat. 

He even changed out a light bulb that was out on my lights for free! I know a bulb isn't a huge deal but it means a lot when they took the time to fix it and even better he didn't even charge me for it. Actions like these are what make excellent service into exceptional service. 

Since then I've gotten brake pads done here; I got a free oil change out of it. Valve adjusted. Always been quoted less than other places and I know I can trust them."
positive,"This is the 2nd time I came here for my oil change and it's only $12.95 so with tax it comes out to $17.00 which isn't bad compared to other places where they charge $29.99.  They also did my transmission flush for only $69 the first time I came here which is also a good deal.

Service is quick, too.  They're conveniently located on Rainbow between Sahara and Oakey and not hard to find at all."
positive,"I would recommend this company to anyone!  I don't live in Arizona, but I was driving through and my check engine light came on.  Being a woman by myself in an unknown area, I was a little nervous- but they were so great and looked everything over.  It ended up being a simple $20 fix and 30 minutes later I was back on my way home without any other problems.  They really could have told me anything and I would have believed them and paid whatever it took to get back on the road, but they were honest and empathetic to my situation.  Thank you so much, I wish there was one closer that I could use more often :)"
positive,"This is a very true story of how Christian Brothers Automotive works.  They have done a front end alignment,  some rack and pinion work, a full brake job, and some misc other work on my Toyota.   After a long road trip, I noticed the brakes were causing a big shimmy on the front end, so also knowing I needed some tires, I had some 70K Bridgestones put on and had a brake job done.  I went to rotate my tires at 9k and the fronts were gone, with extreme wear to the inside of the fronts.

I went back to CBA and showed them my tires and they were aghast at the wear.  Put my car up on the rack and found my tolerances way out.  I had new tires put back on the fronts and had them realign the car again.  My check engine light had also come on and I was in need of an engine sensor.

After I had to buy $425 worth of front tires again, they took responsibility for aligning my car and replacing the sensor for me at no charge.  While many shops would have found an excuse to place the tire wear on me, they did the right thing and really worked with me to ensure I was taken care of.  They ate about $375 worth of work that they didn't have to.

Each time I go in to their shop, I am treated respectfully, am communicated with on estimate and finish time, but most importantly, they want to make you feel like a valued customer and want your return business. 

Thank you Christian Brother Automotive for taking some responsibility in my cars problem and making me a happy, returning, customer."
positive,"I recently traveled to Henderson from Los Angeles for a business trip. Upon my arrival my check engine light came on... so I knew I was in for a long few days. The following day after doing some research and reading some reviews on yelp I came across Valley Automotive. Before making my way to my clients home, my team and I picked up a Uhaul (which we needed for my client anyways) and dropped off my car. it was instantly in great hands with Casey and his team. After checking out my car Casey informed me that it was a good ole transmission problem. He communicated with me throughout the process and was VERY understanding and sincere about my situation. Since my car was still under warranty he contacted the Dodge dealerships to try and make arrangements for me to get it repaired prior to my return back to Los Angeles. He took care of everything. :) AMAZING. Once we realized that it was best to just tow my car back to Los Angeles, he let me store it at his repair shop until I was able to pick it up and haul it back on an auto transport with the uhaul. And if that wasn't enough when I arrived to pick it up his team helped me load it on the auto transport! 

I have never BEEN MORE GRATEFUL for the kindness, flexibility and amazing communication of Casey and his team. Everyone is always looking for an honest mechanic. A place that you can take your car and trust that you aren't getting ripped off... just b/c you are girl or might not know everything about cars. I found this mechanic in Casey and his team. I wish I lived in Henderson b/c he would have my  business for life. Amazing job! Thank you thank you thank you! When I got back to LA and had to deal with my dealership here... I felt prepared. 

You have my referral for life!"
positive,"Service department is great! My family and I just moved to this area and have already gone to the dealership for a routine oil change the in the quick lane and transmission service on our Ford edge. Hands down the best experience I've ever dealt with from a service department in the valley. Blows Berge Ford out of the water and makes me as comfortable and supported as my great experiences with Jim Click Ford down in Tucson. Quick Lane service is amazing and the whole staff is extremely knowledgable and hospitable even when I am not operating 100% before my coffee kicks in (which you can get right there at the little cafe while you wait). No hassle on pricing. Last visit was at no charge even though I had a handful of minor concerns to address. Had a rental car provided to my wife at 15$ a day for 3 days while they closely tried to diagnose the issues based on my descriptive sounds and suggestions . In that time they reprogrammed the transmission controls and added a quart to my transmission fluid (not sure why it was low, no leak) and back in a week for full transmission service. Also fixed blower/ vacuum leak in my brake system. Keeping my family safe on the road. I rarely buy from a dealership and I don't know how the sales side is yet at San Tan Ford so this review is purely regarding parts and service department. I'm very appreciative of the team there. So far I think everyone's name is Eric. I've dealt with two Erics and they were both excellent. Look forward to taking my vehicle back again and may even look for my Ford diesel there rather than private party or small dealership."
positive,"Above and BEYOND customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was referred to Allstate by Tucker Tire (another excellent automotive repair place!) for transmission issues.  I had just purchased a used 2002 Dodge 15 passenger van and had it die on me the weekend before heading up the I-17 in Cordes Junction.  Turns out that it needed a transmission cooler installed.  I took it to Allstate the next day and they were happy to give me a ride home (approximately 8 miles) while they worked on my van.  I was desperate to get the repairs done quickly and correctly -- as I was headed to Colorado the next day.  I'm a professional dog handler and was heading to a dog show with 2 other people and 5 dogs!!  I was nervous when I picked up the van...as I had just recently purchased from a private party that did not keep good records on the repairs she had done -- but I was assured by the guys there that it was a good van and could easily make it to Colorado now that it had a new transmission cooler.

Well, we got an early start on our trip the next morning and left Phoenix about 5:00 a.m. --- made a pit stop at Cordes Junction to get gas and snacks...and as I returned to the van from the store, I was TERRIFIED to see red liquid dripping out all over from the front of the van!!!  In a panic, I called the number on the business card from Allstate --- and I was shocked (but in a GOOD way) that Jeff Wilson (the general manager) answered the phone!!!  It was only 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning!!!  I explained the problem to Jeff as well as the fact that we were already an hour outside of Phoenix and with 5 dogs in the van -- it was getting hot and I HAD to get on the road.  Jeff was understanding and advised me to add some transmission fluid to get me up the road a bit to the home of the gal that we were picking up.  I had to hang out there for a few hours....but Allstate SENT A TECHNICIAN ALL THE WAY TO MAYER, AZ TO FIX THE PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have never heard of customer service like this!!!!  I feel terrible that I have forgotten the gentleman's name that came to help -- but he arrived on his motorcycle with every part they could possibly need to fix the van -- turns out it was a faulty cooler and he had to replace that -- which he did at no charge.  Although we got an extremely late start on our trip -- I can't say enough about how pleased I was at the way Allstate handled this problem.  I plan on using them for all future repairs on this vehicle!!!!"
positive,"I'm so glad I was recommended by friends to this place. This was my first time, and I'll be back! I asked in a VW group I'm in and several people said go here, so I tried it and I'll be back. 

I had an issue with my check engine light that another performance place couldn't figure out but London figured it out quickly and fixed it.  They even took my car next door to get the emissions test. They went above and beyond and for that I'll be back. I'm so glad I found an awesome trustworthy European car mechanic. 

Customer service was great. Prices are great for the level of service. They even have a waiting room with premium channels to help ya be comfy while ya wait. Thanks guys! I'll be back around soon!"
positive,"The best , most honest mechanic I've ever met . Hard working professional . Refer as many people to Narcisso as possible . I no longer dread having my car repaired ."
positive,Highly recommend this shop for muffler and exhaust work. I made an appointment and was in and out in only 15 minutes. Minor repair for a rubber exhaust hanger was treated with the same service as if I was getting a full system. Excellent service!
positive,"Imagine, driving down 15 south and see the Vegas lights and looked down to see a check engine light turn on! Bitter sweet entrance to Vegas... There was no change in drive quality but to make sure I researched several places around the strip. I decided to go to Liberty Tech and Tire, where I found very professional, trustworthy, and timely car repair. I found that the check light code was for a faulty catalytic converter. Rashid gave a very honest solution, where the parts would take 1-2 business days to arrive to Vegas because its usually not stocked and informed me that the best option was to carry on and drive my Subaru as is.  It turns out that some Subaru's activate check lights because of certain atmosphere conditions that Vegas have. I took his word and the next day drove back to the bay area and on the way back along interstate 5 the check light went away. Till this day, it has not came back. If you are looking for a down to earth mechanic that will give you your best option, this is the place to go to!. Rashid's advice save me from getting a costly, unnecessary repair done."
positive,"The check engine light came on of the BFs car so we came in for them to read the code. It's fairly simple, quick and free to do at Autozone. 

They read the code and then printed us out papers of what it means and items we might need and parts that they  have/ can order and those that they cannot. 

This was way more painfree than asking your stealership to read your car and get hustled for a handful of things that they tell you the car needs."
positive,"Good service, reasonable, and no hanky-panky on the deal.

I had the brakes, spark plugs, oil changed, and fluids flushed. Price was reasonable and Anthony even downgraded the cost when the transmission fluid didn't need to be changed.

Impressed."
positive,Great place when my Corolla had a problem in the muffler. Tony and Basil were great in helping me all throughout the repair by finding the cheapest solution and going the extra mile to make sure I left their shop happy! I will definitely return for other repairs as they are both certified by Toyota.
