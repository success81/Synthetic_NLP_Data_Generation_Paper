here's why i love firestone so much:
1. they are honest

great service, they had our car repaired very quickly and they saved us a brake job that was probably not so important once we got it done!

very friendly, informative, and a real pride in their work.

if you are looking for a down to earth mechanic that is honest then you will not be disappointed.  check out bob and his crew for yourself.  they are just two guys with a ton of experience and knowledge that i would never doubt. 

thanks to rashid and bernard you will not have to worry about your car again.  wish i had the opportunity to thank them for getting my car back to me so that i could give them a honest appraisal of what could be the problem.  thanks to these guys.

$23.99 for a transmission flush and oil change is nothing compared to what other places charge and i keep my car for as long as i need it for when i travel.  they are not for profit, so all the work done is ethical.

i hope my review was helpful. if you live in las vegas and own a vehicle that is not in a warranty, you need to get it checked out. if you own a car that is not in a warranty and is/was covered by the tampered with warranty, you need to get it replaced. if you own a car that is covered by the tampered with warranty and is/was not covered by the tampered with warranty, but still wish to purchase another car that is not covered by the tampered with warranty, you need to purchase the other car through a transmission shop other than buff ones. 

this is why i love las vegas and i will never take my car anywhere

I bought in my car from sun auto off of stephanie street. i brought it in on 10/30/18 and met with the nicest bunch of guys. nick helped me out as to what was wrong and showed me what his plan was. it was a fairly large job as far as replacing the transmission was concerned. he also assured me that i would never have to go back to my previous mechanic. well first of all i have to tell you the story of what happened - my actual transmission needed to be replaced because my previous mechanic couldn't do it. nick and his techs did it all and more. second of all i have to tell you the good fortune that i stumbled upon this shop during my recent travels. i have traveled all over the world

I bought in my car a little early so that i could trick the system into thinking i had a new cylinder that needed to be replaced, i realized that this caused a lot of unnecessary stress on my car and i was scared to death of having a new or recirculated mess all over my garage.

I bought in my car from a different toyota dealership because that dealership was unwilling to diagnose and repair the safety issues that honda had with the car. honda's transmission repair bill was $756. over the past few months i have paid for several other repairs to honda if you can believe that. 

2013 was an exciting year for me as i transitioned from my girly pink to a more masculine red, white and blue. i am extremely happy with my new look! i went to honda to get my brakes done and i am very happy and they really did fix my front brakes where they over tightened my prior and they also completely rebuilt my transmission.

I bought in my car transmission fluid, brake pads and front rotors from adison transmission, wa, they were all top notch and replaced my transmission with a kit that was nearly perfect, if a little pricey.

i also bought a pair of wheels from adison, they were quite a bit less expensive than my other choices and they were a completely functional rear alignment.

again, top notch work and they're very good quality.

if i could give them a negative review i would, because i just wish that i had more extensive knowledge of vehicle maintenance prior to my purchase.

i fully understand that this is a new vehicle, and may not always be your cup of tea, but i'd rather have a positive review than nothing at all

328,aws by training went out and i had to have my truck towed to aamco for aikatsu.  this was no small expense - $875 plus tax = a loss of $170 ($110 per item).  however, jimmy and team were amazing and worked with me to come up with a plan B.  i drove my truck over 2k unplanned miles - costlier than coming over the border, but it was still a great decision.

overall i'm very happy with the service i received from kevin

I bought in my carfax at auto xperts and it showed a problem with my cat having a transmission problem. i took it to my local kia and tom radtke was the service representative that met me. he told me that my transmission needed to be replaced. i am a woman and i understand that my car may not be able to get to an appropriate place for major repairs, but i was determined to get it done. tom also informed me that i may need a new transmission fluid, brake fluid, and power steering fluid. i am so glad i researched all of these things and found tom's place. i went in and am very happy with tom's service. i will definitely bring my car here for all future work.

I bought in my car from a different toyota dealer in vegas and the service was terrible. bryce quickly got the ball rolling and helped narrow down the issues that needed fixing. he was able to agree to terms that kept costs down while also ensuring a smooth transition for all my future maintenance needs. since my car was already in good condition, i was able to purchase a second opinion and a revised transmission performance review...all for only $100! (i wish i would have bought this car sooner) thanks bryce and all i did was shop around for other options. i'm extremely happy and will, for sure, reach out to him in the future.

I bought in my carfax at autozone because they were the only two shops that did not repair my transmission correctly. i was given a repair estimate that was more than good fortune as there were unscheduled service items that required their attention. 

we arrived at autonation late on a friday morning and waited in the lobby for work to begin. 

we walked in on a friday at 5:30 am and by 10 am the shop was bustling with activity. 

bob was very friendly and quick. he communicated with me throughout the process and was very professional and efficient. 

the prices were fair. i only had to wait around half an hour while he worked on my car.

instead of fixing my car, they suggested i check out some other junk in my garage. found this little guy, adjusted the fit and it was perfect. i've been driving it around for a couple of months now, and don't see any major damage. it's only 4 feet high, but that's about all i need to know about it. i can't say enough good thing about this little guy!

I bought in my car will probably never have that option again, especially since i have such a bad habit of breaking down and having to have my car towed everywhere i need it fixed.  

this time was different.  i got a full tune up and more (oil change, spark plug replacement, transmission flush).  i also had them check out my brakes and rotors for free.  all good in and of themselves, but the good news was that they found no leakage or need to do any work on my car that i wasn't prepared to pay for.

I bought in my car on friday, march 29, 2016, around 5:00 pm. carole greeted me at the station and checked my car in quickly. she kept me informed throughout the process and was very supportive in encouraging me to bring it in. she ensured that i was taken care of, cleaned and disinfected my car before handing it back over to me. i was very proud that she accepted responsibility for my car and that she went above and beyond to make it a success. my only criticism is that she did not keep me updated throughout the process to keep me informed about what was being done to my car. hopefully, i will not need to have any of my vehicles serviced again nor do i anticipate needing any of my vehicles serviced anytime soon

I bought in my car and before the diagnostic was done the sales representative for my car told me it was covered by my insurance and that i would not need to get it repaired.  while i was somewhat skeptical about the coverage because i had never been to a mechanic and also wanted to see a doctor, they were able to get my coverage paid for the repair.  it was neat having a mechanic that was knowledgeable in the first place, and that was able to convince me to go ahead with the repair.

the repair was completed as planned.  my car was feeling a little wobble when i picked it up, but i knew it was just stress and that i would be fine.

i had a coupon for a part synthetic oil change for under $100, which was a great deal. having never had a problem with my car and not even knowing what to expect, i was surprised and pleased. they even stayed up late when i picked up the car because i had to leave earlier than normal to go home. they were so friendly as we waited.

I bought in my car needed for an oil change and was told it was not needed and would only come in useful on certain days.  while in town i went to a local dealership with my question answered by the service manager.  the service was quick, friendly and professional.  the only negative thing i can say is that they left my car in a lot of hot weather (not that i'm a huge fan of the hot car thing) but i'm sure my car would suffer without the constant soaking wet conditions in vegas.

side note: i heard a noise i thought was rubber being worn on the inside of my car but i'm not sure if that was the noise of the suv or the transmission slipping.  back to the dealership!

- a standard issue xterra (primarily for insurance purposes but also because i like driving Challengers)

I bought in my car from a different toyota dealer because that dealership was unwilling to diagnose the issues that were plaguing my car and actually began bragging about their incompetence the very next day. i wish i had the young man's name that diagnosed my car because he was super courteous, knowledgeable, and professional. my car was fixed that same day and i have nothing but good words to say about dennis and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. dennis has already begun to earn my trust by pointing out potential issues that i may not have fully appreciated. i know that the car i am driving will be back on the road soon (hopefully not anytime soon that i don't care how long it takes to get it back). thank you d

I bought in my car Ok. and decided i wanted a new headlight. ordered the brackets from adison automotive and zain engineer. workmanship is top notch. materials and construction is really nice. only complaint is the transmission seal needs to be replaced. i can live with that as it's not a huge deal and i only get a partial seal replacement.
i'm really happy with my new headlight and how it sounds very good. will be coming back for sure!

This is going to be tough.

i took my vehicle in to the dealer on 12/14/2014, and the day after i arrived at the dealership, i asked if i could receive a ride.  greg and his crew - especially jennifer - were incredible.  my car was finally getting the attention it deserved!

we were halfway through the day when the transmission went out.  jennifer took my car in to the dealership the next day, and they were even nice enough to let me bring my car in to get

brought in carsten and dan for a test drive. well, i can tell you right away that you will not be treated any differently because you are male and have a truck!  i took my truck in because i had an oil leak in my transmission. i was told at the dealership that i was going to have to have the transmission flushed because the dealer was not thorough enough on diagnosing the problems. well, duane went above and beyond the call of duty by not only checking my diagnostic reports but also by going on a road trip to show me that i could drive my truck!

if i ever have any issues again, i know exactly who i can trust! thank you duane and dan for saving me 100$ from gas money and 5

brought in carla, who seemed to know more than she knew about cars, and who was able to answer all my questions.  the carla i brought in was a nice surprise, as was the fact that it didn't smoke or have a noise that was not there - something that might have been the transmission.  these kinds of minor things that might have been signs of a bad transmission are what i consider a good ole' transmission.

carla also found that when i went to change my oil, it actually made the oil in my pocket bigger, rather than make it smaller.  it was a good thing that it didn't explode, as it could have damaged my pocket watch.  but it also caused a small hole in my jacket

brought in carpenter and got it running smooth.  after about 3k miles, the check engine light came on and i was starting to worry. the car has SIRI clutches and i was starting to get worried. i took it into mike and greg and they were both very understanding and told me what could potentially be wrong. i am happy to say that everything was diagnosed and i was given a great price to get the car back to my family. thank you greg and mike i hope the dealership realizes you are a family owned business with good intentions."

i dropped the car off that afternoon and walked into city automotive for the appointment. the first thing i did was call the manufacturer directly to find out what adjustments would be needed. based on what was written on the package insert, adjustments were written up for only $180. my concern was realized when they told me that my car was covered by warranty, but didn't tell me how to return the car if i didn't want to buy it

as we waited, we discussed what we could do with the carol we had.  her suggestions included buying a new transmission shaft bearing and doing all the work necessary to get it done.  while we were discussing this, carol had the bearing replaced.  now we have no problems.  i stand corrected.  and i thank dan for keeping

we drove around from stop to stop giving these guys a hard time.  eventually we got lucky and enough, with the help of car max, to get the car repaired.  well, pretty much the same thing happened after i had it taken care of.  i was in and out in a few hours.  i highly recommend cars max as a place to go for muffler and other exhaust work.  they are extremely reasonably priced ($shorter then some others) and you're paying for quality work."

that obstacle was overcome in the nick of time.  the folks at kris were great to work with again.  the only issue i ran into after the break was that i wish i would have gotten my car checked out by now and should have gotten a second opinion.  i am relieved that i was treated fairly and know that i have been well taken care of.  thanks kris and the rest of the staff

brought in car engines and transmissions and this week i had my check engine light come on.  i got in touch with jamie thaler, the service manager, who told me that a check engine light alone was not enough to void my warranty.  

we researched online and found that a factory warranty would work just fine.  the problem was finding a shop that could read my car's diagnostic reports.  i kept hearing and feeling the same things i had been hearing and feeling my whole life.

after traveling to las vegas and sitting in my car for over a week, i came to the conclusion that this was a myth.  being a woman, i was expecting to be lied to or have my car looked at to determine if

brought in carolis and a couple of sets of parents gloves. he also serviced the rotors and fixed some other minor issues.

the big surprise was when he serviced the front end of my car and confirmed that it was fixed. wow!  the car is so much better than it was!  i could finally get my car repaired without anyone else!

i highly recommend carolis. he has fixed my buddies cars (i've got nerf warner, a honda civic, and a 2015 honda civic EX) and he doesn't try to rip you off. he does it all himself and you're paying for the best expertise for a reasonable price.

brought in car troubles can be a real pain but at least they know where to go and it's not just me they have to worry about.

a real shame is car shopping and dealerships as they used to be. these days you need to look no further. for serious car issues it's more likely you are talking about the transmission or transmission parts. t & m are pretty honest about pricing used cars on the web places like usa car care. for example, if you are really bad at car shopping and your car is a serious safety issue (which millions of innocent people are unfortunately admitted to by their families to pay for their cars) they will take care of you.

brought in carla h. at phil mode.  she ran a full diagnostic check of the check engine light and found that it was just a loose fuel filter that had been placed on incorrectly.  the good news was that she could easily replace the part without having to replace the whole filter.  the bad news was that she had to wait 14 days for it to fully heal.  being a woman, i wanted to see the repair completed, so i reached out to my husbands mechanic, jim, who is the owner of transcend automotive.  i spoke with jim regarding the problem and his repair suggestions.  we began discussing the issues with the car on monday.  jim suggested i take it to him to get his opinion.

one of the possible problems was a problem with the gas cap,  so we checked that out as well.  it turns out that the cap was leaking and needed to be replaced.

we picked it up and dropped it off at 10:15, but it still didn't do the trick.  then, we checked out on an dyno to see what would happen.  it turns out that the cap needed to be replaced.

luckily our car was covered under warranty, and the

car plus battery lasted 12 months. maintenance that i considered very expensive, in this day and age of carriers and uninsured i thank the men at car plus battery for their care and expertise.

i was very skeptical about buying a car from a private seller, especially a used car. i have dealt with many private sellers in the past, and sellers that i have worked with in the past, and i can say that private sellers are very tenable. seller acadiana is one such seller that i have never had any issues with. i would never buy from them. even when i was a victim of a smash and grab i always managed to

brought in carolina classica (cameras, laser rangefinder, automated transmission, quiet cabin, etc.) for a test drive....eventually the check engine light went on and the car started jerking when activated. carol was able to get the car into the shop and activate the carabiner so that was that. 

the only issue i ran into was that my carabiner was off the 2nd time i brought it in. if that holds true, i'll definitely be bringing it in for regular maintenance/ repair (which it should continue to be) before deciding whether to keep it or sell it. 

i'm very happy with my car, with the service i received and with the value of the trade-in

brought in car troubles,  one of the mechanics, ron, was able to see me right away and give me a very honest assessment of what was wrong with my car. before heading to the shop, i had an appointment to make  with my insurance - a very expensive plastic pipe replaced. 

the morning after getting my car repaired - i woke up and started having problems with my car going on 500 miles per year. i checked my battery and noticed that it was dead and needed new one. i checked my computer and noticed that it was old and warrantied 2,800 miles. i checked my gas cap and noticed that it had a leak. i did the math on gas cap replacement,  and decided that 2,800 mile warranties

brought in car lot, that was the first car i noticed was missing.  this is where i found my malibu, for one reason or another i can't remember.  i brought it in, and kris (the mechanic)  unscrewed the motor and found that it had three bad parts that would prevent gasoline from being properly oxidized.  he ordered the car washed, and it arrived damp and very dirty.  i asked him to clean the damp spot, and he did just fine.  the car was then covered by a warranty and i was in and out in a few hours.  i have to say i was extremely pleased with the service, and i would return here.  i know i sound like a broken record, but

brought in carpenter chris to widen my tires.  the vice president of sales, todd, patiently explained to me the pros and cons of numerous brands of tires.  i listened to his advice and purchased my desired replacement rear rotors from amazon.  while driving along the highway, i thought to myself, if i bought my car fully loaded, i could probably make it to japan in time for my scheduled return trip.  while cruising along the highway, i thought to myself, how bad can they get?  well, it turns out that they can get much, much worse.

i bought my car fully loaded and inflated my tire  using the instructions on the box.  while doing so, i carefully weighed out the necessary repairs

brought in car maintenance people to fix the check engine light.  the bill?  about $34.99.  i know a lot about cars, but not everything.  so i asked the mechanic what else he/she could fix for less than the generic auto on the street.  the mechanic mentioned that the spark plugs and the air filter socket needs to be replaced.  which brought me back to my car.  i've been here many a times for smogs, oil changes, and other basic service.  this is the place to get your car repaired (not once did i feel like i was being taken advantage of due to my lack of knowledge relating to car repair).  they are compassionate and kind, always looking for the best way to

brought in caribou #33, who drove my 1996 note regal pretty hard, and caribou shat himself (hard) over the top and bottom.  the symptoms stated by the mechanic were true, and they were trying to rip me off!

to cut to the chase;  i had mail addressed to me from four different countries, with no particular reason given. the only thing i could think was that they were going to try to ""out me"" because i was married to a man who drove a 1998 honda, and i had 3 foreign exchange student visas that kept me safe in 4 different countries. i was not prepared to pay $4,600 to an unknown company to fix my transmission issues that stemmed from being married to

 his comment back is incorrect regarding how many times i have visited, but that is probably due to my last name changing.

brought in carla to check it out.  while the check engine light was on, she noticed that the car was running sluggish and then picked it up and drove it for about 4 miles until it died on the highway.  the car sat for a week at the dealership before i took it in.  i had them reinstall the transmission and break it in again.  i did a huge favor for them and dealt with a nuisance who i now am and will probably never have in my car.  these guys are honest and have the best interest of my car at heart.  highly recommend them.  i will be bringing my car here from now on."

brought in car problems.  one of my complaints was waiting times.  i was hoping to get my car repaired rather than having it stored for a few weeks.  i was disappointed to learn that while they did wait times, ""the wait wasn't much of a bother."

i have since purchased a couple of other things from this shop, and will continue to be a customer, but this shop is and always will be my first stop for servicing services.

as a woman, i know i have been lied to before or at least been lookied-up-for-fault in the past when attempting to get a car repaired.  i have always been more than compensated for with tenday, postponement, or both.  i

brought in carpal tunnel repair. and i was quoted a rate that was 55%-60% higher than all other repair shops combined. very nice.

how about a quickie brake polish.... $19.99? that's 33% cheaper than the brock wrench shop and only 3% higher than my brock wrench..... oops."
268,the brock wrench shop was recommended by carmax and is the cheapest of the non-transmission repair shops. the big jacks are identical to the trans and disk jacks except for the trans and hoses. they were recommended by carmax so i was able to get them to compare quotes on ebay. the prices were identical to other places.

brought in carpal tunnel and that was the end of it. but i digress...

after leaving my car at the shop the following day, i mentioned to chris that i found out i had carpal tunnel when i went to the emergency room. it turns out that these are built to fail and that having a check engine light on was the problem. they were aggressive and ordered a new catalytic converter ($60) and a new radiator ($60) to try again. they were kind enough to do this for free and look how happy i was at the end!

i have come here multiple times now for minor things and they are friendly, welcoming and drink pretty good right?

brought in carole.  she paused the presentation to let me test drive it first thing on a friday morning.  it handles like a dream.  the only negative thing i can say is that the salesman kept referring to it like it was new, which was a bummer because i really like to see cars I buy work before i send them to my wife.

brought in car whose check engine light was on and  who had just rolled a $250 bill on the road. dylan was nice enough to look these guys up and down and decided who was worthy of a new diagnostic port.  a rare shop to find a shop that was competent to do the work and who actually looked at the repair as a whole.  very generous of them to drop the price on a whole new diagnostic port.  oh and the actual diagnostic port was covered by a warranty.  so all i really did was take it to a dealership where i purchased the car from and pay for it.  that's all.  now i'm back on the road and can finally drive my car again.  no more $100 on the repair

brought in carpenter's square for an estimate.  the quote was $5400.  

luckily for me, my car wasn't going to be covered by a warranty, so i opted to fix it myself.  recommended a good friend to deal with,    she was more than willing to take care of the problem. 

we fixed the problem, but due to rumbling in the chassis (twice my tolerance for noise) the car is only nominally done.  

i'm not sure if the transmission is still in good condition, but i'm assured by mr. that this will be addressed prior to my return.

big jim then told me that a lot of these reviews were probably true, and that he wouldn't push me into replacing my battery just because i didn't reciprocate his offer to buy a new one (since i was probably still using the old one).
my last mod was a major job and involved completely new transmission and electronics. i was ready to buy a new car, but jim cut me a deal: he charged me a very reasonable price (parts and labor), and told me that he'd try to get me into a car for as soon as i was out of town.

brought in car values equal to those of other states in the region. other states in the region, such as ny, and western rehoboth, have very good service programs that result in excellent car values for the consumer. 

we will continue to use this dealership in future services, as we have with the previous managers, engin and kevin. 

tj and jerry are a great team.  jerry is always looking for the best way to make our vehicles better and has been a pioneer in the development of vehicle controllability.

brought in car jack... and jim checked it all out for us.  the jack, it turned out, was covered by a warranty. they didn't charge us a warranty examination, as they shouldn't have had one, but gave us a very thorough warranty quote.

we took it home, but the warranty company offered to get us a new one for a small charge (they were cheap, $5-10 for a transmission rebuild), and they gave us a very thorough warranty quote.  being car nerds, we looked up mechanics in the warranty department and found jimmy purdy's in the newspaper.  we called the phone number on the website and were shocked (but pleased) that the rental car place can be reached by phone (

luckily my car was covered under warranty at the time and i was given a loaner car so i didn't incur any additional risk... yet another bonus of being a repeat customer.

brought in carolina autonation to do the work.  the price was extremely reasonable and they were very accommodating.  they ended up putting on a transmission and steering wheel seal that i had to do myself.  i am very happy and will definitely come back.

i only had to do the work at night when the shop was open, which was not acceptable to me as i am a sleeper and like many, i like to sleep in.  i awoke to carolina working on my car, thinking it was my transmission, when in fact it was just my oil.  she got me in the next morning and was very charmed by my story.  she even offered to drive me to another shop so that i could get a second opinion

Fast forward to this past weekend. i backed the car into a parking lot and it barely moved.  due to weathering and other factors, i am going to have to take it back to him for a second opinion.  without going into too much detail, brian had the entire exhaust system replaced and added a new flowmaster muffler.

brought in car culture expert ricky to dissect the problem.   ricky was able to fix the problem using only what he learned from my last review and was able to decrease or eliminate the need for an oil change.   

as we worked on the car, ricky kept asking pointed questions that only he could answer.  like the previous reviewer, you could tell he was curious and wowed us with his knowledge.  the problem didn't go away but he was clear that it needed to be fixed.  

we enjoyed driving the car for quite a while and it was quite the experience.  i would have preferred a corporate/landlord to lease the car from, but i was assured that option was  available.

they ended up just adding a fuel pump and changing out the transmission mounts. all told they fixed my diesel passed emissions, though they admit they weren't able to do anything permanent with it because they were unable to undo all the damage to the van caused by the previous owner. like most of these 'fix it now' repair shops you should really speak to the mechanic before taking your van anywhere, as some of these shops are very unprofessional. but if you go to a place like this your first impression is always going to be their high praise and willingness to do whatever it takes to get your van repaired

i found my truck sounds really good.  

i talked to jamie when i brought it in.  she was knowledgeable, friendly, and very willing to check anything out. 

i found a few things that were slightly inaccurate, but nothing too serious.

i won't go anywhere else for mufflers.

brought in carla rose, who was friendly, took my car along to see what would happen.  for starters, the check engine light wouldn't have prevented me from signing up for the service.  the service was quick, professional, and quite a bit cheaper than just about any other shop I've ever been to.  i left my car in peace, with the understanding that i would return if anything arose (hopefully not anytime soon).  i'm very grateful that the dealership selected e-waste as their service provider."

brought in carmel, the dealer for performance mufflers, to inspect and to verify the issue. not only did he show me the issue and explain it, he went on to say that he is 100% confident that i will never need his services again due to the fantastic service i received. i would recommend him to any muffler junkies in the area and would definitely go to his shop for repairs. 

his low pricing is outstanding and he turned down a deal that i might have gotten for a better price elsewhere. he turned down a deal that might have kept my bmw for a few months longer because of his excellent service. i will be going back to get my gt3 done - i will definitely recommend carmel to anyone looking

we were not prepared to pay for the horrible treatment he did to us, but herbie insisted that it was necessary.

brought in car title from german car title - was able to change out the transmission fluid cheaper than canadian tire. permed brake pads and shifter arm from canadian tire were an acquired taste.

my only concern is that ron claims to be an expert in his field but a person from this world needs to spend more time with his fellow man. like santos, he wastes our time and energy.

brought in car terry from phoenix and had him look at my cvs for a recall. turns out that it was just a recall of the axles on the previous car. remember that i had an ac for hire ford express transmission and that the recall included everything from the oil pan to the transmission mounts. they were able to fix all of that by replacing the parts that were susceptible to tearout.

as a side note, car parts are generally pretty cheap in general. for instance, i had a honda transmission thrown away because i couldn't find the part on line and they were offering to replace it for $50 at the dealership. i declined the honda transmission because i don't drive that much and didn't want to deal with

needed transmission repair and was in the process of replacing my flywheel.  i had been told by a previous mechanic that the transmission had been fixed incorrectly and that it was just a timing issue.  while fixing my car did result in a reduction in transmission fluid, the repair was still not done and i was told that the flywheel seal was not damaged and i was good to go back on my road!

to put that in perspective, here are the repair times for a car that you and your mechanic consider to be fully functional:

1. cleaning - 24 hours

2. maintenance - 48 hours
3. repair - 24 hours
4. replacement - 48 hours
5. warranty - 1 year

needed transmission repair generally speaking, i can say that i've had better service experiences with jimmy and his team (as far as i can tell) than any other transmission shop. 

they diagnose and order the proper parts, once they feel comfortable recommending a repair they can actually afford to do (i.e. major engine overhaul), they take ownership of the original mistake and go above and beyond for their customers.

what i found most appealing about jimmy and his team was their honesty and ability to explain the findings and even the small technical details with great straight-forwardness.

i am incredibly grateful that i found this shop and i will be going back if i need anything else repaired. 

as a customer,

he called me up and told me that he had to change my transmission fluid at some point in the near future. he said that it was going to cost about $1,700, but that it would be $150 cheaper to do it myself. i am not a mechanic, but i can tell that he cares about this car as much as i do!"

needed transmission repair on my 02 toyota corolla. john jay is a world-class technician who specifically asked me for my transmission function and output to be tested. not for sale. he did not want to charge me for an "ase" on my transmission that had nothing to do with the actual transmission function. he specifically asked me if i had received any warranty updates and if i had a current and valid transmission. his goal was to fix the actual cause of the transmission problems rather than sky-rocketing my transmission costs by ordering unnecessary repairs. he was not happy with the prices he found on other repair shops, but i was not happy being charged way too much for repairs i did not need. very professional. i will be ordering more from him in

i am so please with my new muffler, as well as the work done to my tranny and engine.

and their prices are great. 
for example:
- the people at brie's auto repair want to charge me $70 for a repair that they consider cosmetic, rather than just fixing a dead headlight. 
- i just had my brakes and rotors replaced.

found this shop online repair shop, i hadn't heard of them before.  finding this shop online gave me the idea to go see one of my friends get her car repaired (was having problems with her car herself).  when i came to pick up my car, the mechanics greeted me and did not try and upsell me on anything i didn't need.  they saved me from having to visit the dealer (which would have been expensive).  they also saved me from having to pay a ton of money i didn't even know i owed.  the cost for repairs was reasonable.  i only had to wait around half an hour while they looked at my car.  i can't say enough good thing about them.  they are trustworthy and have a track

we had chargers placed and our cars back on the road within an hour!

Amazing service. most recently i took my car in for an oil change and it only took an hour for them to get the transmission fluid and alternator out. i expected to have to wait around half an hour for the transmission fluid and an hour for the oil change. wow...that's four people in an hour for this small job! you can't ask for better customer service! thanks again for being awesome!

had a check engine light for throttle body on 2nd gear. stopped by crawford transmission on nuttington st. for tuner assistance. i elected to have my car towed to bay village.

tried to call and yelp helped me locate a nearby dealer with a more extensive service and financing package.

when i arrived at the dealer, i was greeted by a pleasant surprise.

jack was knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.

he offered me assistance prior to my service being performed.

he was up front with the cost and completion of my repairs.

he was professional and informed me that if i had any other concerns, he would be more than happy to address them.

Amazing service, both for the check engine light and the transmission problem.  the vehicle is running better than ever before! 

kevin has also written up a full transmission repair report and some other helpful information for those interested.  a good technical service-desk assistance is appreciated here and there, but rarely are they ever condescending or dismissive towards someone who just wants to help their car get back on the road.

overall: great place for general car repair, auto alignment, and basic car maintenance. the prices are reasonable in comparison to other places in town. the parking is pretty limited, but the floor area is huge, and they have plenty of recline seating. i'd even go so far as to say that the parking garage looks like a midas, with a couple of midas midas ladders and a very clean, waiting room.

you also get honest advice about what you can and cannot afford to fix.

so, how does one go about obtaining a pedicab in your area?

few simple steps:
- get a quick quote from wilhelm (assuming that's the only place you shop)
- go to the marco's location
- call the marco's number
- show up on time"
- if you're lucky enough to live in a geico, you will know where to go - the damn yard sale is in your neighborhood, and you can get ahold of the guy down the street that has a business with you.
- show upston with enthusiasm, and you will be hard pressed to find.
- if you own a 2004 or newer car, you need to take it here

Amazing service!! john and his crew, i mean it with 5 stars - the vw dealership in henderson was awesome on the phone and in person.  the vw dealership service was fast, friendly, polite, and well designed to get me back on the road.  the vw dealership experience was quite the opposite of how i imagined it would be.

· the auto repair shop is, well, an auto repair shop. you need to know what you're doing to prevent costly repairs to your car. 

· there is no discount for a transmission flush.

Amazing service and very professional way to have your car repaired.
their prices are fair and very reasonable for the repair. often times as you go to repair shops you can find repair shops that are not even close to what monro can do.

Amazing service! lindsay was very hospitable and professional. brian was more concerned with the transmission slipping than the transmission itself. i am very happy and will, for sure, go back if i need anything.

i will also say that while i was there i saw two used tractors being serviced.  one was a basic transmission -- the other was a boost transmission -- the former for $270 while the latter for $150.  both were taken care of properly and given a thorough inspection.  the former was deemed ready for prime time and the replacement for the boost transmission was a whopping $400 cheaper than the one i had.  i am extremely pleased and will, again, go back if i need anything else."

Amazing service twice the quality of competition.
 

let me repeat that:

the quality of competition has never been better.

have you looked?

have you ever looked?

have you looked?
have you looked for what?

competition?
competition is where you find the truly good, honest, and good-natured competition that causes others to falter and chafe at the very thought of being judged by a professional.

you will not be disappointed.

Affordable repair based upon their customer service!

leo was kind enough to provide me with a referral to fix my transmission in my Jeep Liberty!

it's an incredibly expensive fix, but the quality of work is truly impressive.

they charge a very reasonable rate and you're truly receiving a top notch repair shop.

thanks again for being there if you were injured or just did poorly on your vehicle!

came here for the second time to get my brakes done.

first time i got my brakes done here is because i was arrested for speeding and arrested for following too close to a light during the same incident.

came back again to get my brakes done due to passing inspection.

as i waited for my car, i had the opportunity to chat with the guys at joes on the phone and once again i was treated with professionalism and courtesy. the only reason i didn't give them a 5 stars is i felt they did not give me enough credit when they greeted me and kept me waiting a long time. but, i still highly recommend them and will be coming back for future repairs

hey, i'm broke, but i'm working class, so i'm okay with that.

i got my car in that day and it didn't need any special repairs.

i also appreciated the fact that they did not try to rip me off by advertising a 5 star hotel/condominium complex just off of lake road, nor by charging me a lot of money to fix my car i didn't need (i only used their buff to get the scratches/springs done).

thanks again guys for being there for the worker, for the service

Affordable repair/maintenance for your vw or audi, this team is worth the drive from chicago!

stopped in while japanese food was being offered. quality was excellent  for authentic japanese food. teriyaki hot pot (with noodles, katsuobushi, tempura fish, and avocado salad) was nothing short of delicious. 

had a small glitch with an oil change, but everything else was great. 

stop in now for an oil change, and ford recommended rotary encoder. 

stop in again for a oil change @ regular intervals. 

stop in for a full transmission update @ 930am. 

stop in again @ 3pm.

tj and his crew, for the most part, are knowledgeable, but they are also very affordable.  i took my tj here for the oil change, which was covered by a rental car agreement.  tj recommended to ryan not to take it here unless it was covered under warranty, since i would most likely not be able to get it done.  ryan thought ofo ryan, who is the current owner, and gave it a good test drive.  i was very impressed, and would go back here unless something came up which it didn't.

when i arrived here a week ago, the car had been outfitted with a new rack and pinion (which thankfully i have no concerns about collision prevention).

i took it into 'roof house' for a few days while they had it back on the road.

since that time we have also had our brakes done here, along with a brake fluid flush and some other maintenance. prices are reasonable, service is friendly, and i'd give this shop a 5 star rating if it were elective.

oil leak repair. all of these guys are very professional and have one or two other credits to show for it. i would highly recommend flushing your brakes, flushing your oil, and/or changing your oil catch pan as well as your electrical system. i have been treated unfairly and will continue to be so impressed with the service i receive from pete and his team at p&j. if you are in the area and looking for a place that you can trust to service your vehicle, look no further. don't be deterred by the high prices. these guys are well trained, educated, and will always give you a fair price. i would highly recommend pete's to all of my friends and family.

in addition to replacing your transmission, you will receive information on:

rebuilding your engine

expanding your brakes

diagnosing and repairing other engine issues

you will then receive a diagnosis of what is probably holding your car back from being truly complete and repair any remaining issues at a reasonable cost.

you will receive a fitting for your vehicle during the repair and insurance will be reimbursed by your repair shop.

i have never had a problem with any of my repairs here, and i have paid a lot of money for them to be able to do what i want them to do.

good service.  keep up the good work."
23,"the only reason i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the poor condition of the other stars. the motor needs to be replaced. winter ball should have replaced my oil cooler and replaced my transmission mount. these other stars were so-so. the condition of the other 3 rd. led me to believe they were replaced. but yelp clearly stated otherwise.

here's why:

the previous yelp reviews were mostly regarding parking. parking is fine for james, but i have no intention of going back. 

i came here based on the reviews, and i can vouch for that because james is awesome at filling the lot with supplies

good service.

while in vegas i called sidetrack and spoke with barry. he informed me that they were unable to accommodate my vehicle for a garage fitting until the following weekend, 29 july 2016.

i went online and found a used honda crv. i scheduled it to come back on 11 p.m. on friday. to my surprise, bill told me that he had already seen the fit (as per policy) and let me know that i was good to go!

i arrived at the shop a little disappointed, but eager to get back on the road.

i met barry and chris, who assured me that they were able to accommodate my vehicle for a garage fitting (since

I bought in my car washer and dryer and they did a great job. although a bit disappointing that i had to wait so long for repairs. i will certainly return with any outstanding repairs asap. thanks again guys for being awesome at what you do."

I bought in my car needed a new A/C compressor and cold air intake. welp, here we go again.

the salesman was telling me that the dealer would be unwilling to do the work because it would cost over $500. i thought that was so funny, because i would have to spend over $500 at my local dmv to get the work done.

ok, that was a little far fetched, but i kept my car and drove it until i found out who was lying. it turns out i was dealing with a dead engine that needed new one. 

i went home, but the next day my car didn't work. i called duane back and explained the situation. he immediately came out and got the

I bought in my car, oil changed & transmission fluid change), they were willing to do this for a small charge, before offering to answer all my questions. the car was running fine before & after the service. did i mention that i'm a woman, 5'8" & 135lbs & this car won't hurt??? very satisfied!!"

great service, however, it came with a price; after extensive research and negotiation, i came to realize that this was not necessarily a bad thing.  i went into the experience frustrated and honestly, distrustful of dealerships; however, over the course of the following months i came to realize that many vendors were honest and fair with me, and not just with dealerships; and i came to realize that i could and should trust retailers as well."

517,"just moved to vegas and my check engine light came on.  stopped at the dealership with hopes they could see me.  lisa in the service dept. could not have been more helpful.  got a replacement cylinder, re-started my car and was out the door in 1 min.  

they also cleaned my truck (moved out back) and my transmission (down low) which was dirty from when i picked it up.  

i will definitely be bringing my car here for all future service.  

the customer service was great.  they even were able to
