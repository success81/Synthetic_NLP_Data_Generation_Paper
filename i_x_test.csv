124,"bartender, jerry, took great care of me. he recommended the date/jalapeño pizza. incredible! highly recommended!!"
54,"we ate there friday night and it was an absolute delight.

scott the owner, the staff and the décor was very inviting.

the pizza was very good. the combination of the tasty crust, the right amount of sauce and a fresh mozzarella along with quality toppings makes it the best pizza i've had in arcadia area. it was even tasty the next day.

what i liked about it the most is that they're not trying to be a fancy place or going all snobby on the food as the arcadia area restaurants do way too much.  they obviously just want to be a pizza parlor offering a good pizza, at a fair price and they seem to be doing a good job of it.

they also have byob, you can bring in your own bottle of wine or beer and drink it with your food. i don't why but i find this kind of cool

we will definitely be back."
43,"i wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues...

we were very excited to move into sun prairie where there was a glass nickel pizza nearby (we previously lived in the milwaukee area).  the day after we moved in, we decided to order glass nickel to eat while unpacking.  the staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  pizza itself was okay, but not nearly as good as the new berlin and west madison locations.

the next day, we became violently ill.  with the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing i ate all day so i'm sure that it was from this.  my husband and i are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  we do not plan on re-visiting the sun prairie glass nickel pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  such a shame!!"
68,"after hearing so many people in the area raving about folco's i finally decided to try it out. and we were looking for a reception spot for a baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  i was disappointed about the food. the veal parmigiana was sub-par. too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. my husband tried a pasta dish which was ""ok"" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. the drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste i was hoping to get out of it. the caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. their tomato sauce - homemade i was told - tastes like something out of a jar. i was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the italian restaurant across the street. i was hoping to go back & try out their pizzas, but there is a much better italian restaurant in the garden basket plaza that makes everything from scratch and i have been a regular of theirs since they opened."
5,"if giordano's is looking to compete with lou malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe. the crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza. lou malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries. c'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!

to someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite. 

overall giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either. they could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks.
 
if you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to grimaldi's."
134,came in during lunch. pretty busy inside but nice atmosphere has a really nice patio seating area. got the garlic knots as an appetizer very good! got the margarita pizza with sausage on it super yummy!
12,"loved the pizza. they had a great selection. services wasn't bad. the wings are also tasty. it was the breakfast of champions!

 ; ^ d"
198,"bad service and never enough cheese pizza, this place used to be good but it's gone downhill."
47,"the best thing about our visit was our waitress. she was attentive and apologetic that the pizza was terrible. it was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. too bad. it was the first time we have been out in the evening in 4 months.what a disappointment!  we won't be returning."
76,"pizza was pretty authentic, i am a new yorker so always looking for good pizza. also, tried the cannoli and it was awesome."
154,order came cold and incorrect. ordered off grubhub. no fault with grubhub. won't order pizza from this restaurant again.
157,just finished lunch.  the atmosphere was very pleasant.  the food was really good.  i had a custom pizza and feel that it was reasonably priced.  the service was fine and the food came out in a timely fashion.  i was somewhat reticent to go after reading the pther yelp reviews but experienced none of the conditions depicted in previous reviews.  the fact that they all menyioned yhe same vompetitor makes me wonder if there aren't some shenanigans going on.  my advice is to try it if you like brick oven thin crust pizza.  you won't be disappointed.
155,"i would like to give it no stars.  the pizza was burnt.  we ordered a cheese plate, and the only thing they got right was the olives (which is standard).  i had to ask for the flatbread that came with it.  we ordered one cheese and two meats... i got two cheeses and one meat and it wasn't even the meat that we ordered.  my cloth napkin had holes in it.  but the bartender is flirting with my boyfriend to make it right... this place sucks."
164,"stopped in on a sunday afternoon and i could not resist a slice of pizza and a beer for $5. it turned out to be a good choice. i liked the pizza. it has a crispy crust and they really load up the toppings. it's also a very large slice of pizza. i was pleasantly full after just one slice. not that it stopped me from ordering a second slice.

we also tried the bruschetta appetizer, which was quite good. the serve a bowl of the mixed up toppings with a generous portion of toasted crostini. my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. not a big deal, really.

i'll be back."
124,"i don't see the point. it is a mess and ugly which fair enough is not news to anyone but now prices are high and not competitive. the same pizza is cheaper at no frills, shoppers and lango's! and of course everything is strewn around in ugly fashion forget it"
21,"i recently went to this restaurant with a group of friends as i had heard so many positive reviews and must say artigiani definately lived up to expectations. this resto serves up one  of the best wood oven pizza's in montreal.their  pizza is thin crust  and  they a have wide variety of pizza's that will please your pallette.  ambiance is cozy and modern decor. they also serve up a great seafood pasta dish for all you seafood lovers and must not forget to mention their fried calamari entree. lastly, be sure to leave room for their wonderful tiramisu dessert served in a gelato glass. would definately recommend!"
118,"it's not the best pizza ever, not the best in the strip. for the best pizza i would probably go to grimaldi's at the venetian. but this is good, quality pizza. tasteful and quite convenient if you are at the aria. 

for a quick bite, it gets the job done. you won't be disappointed, especially if you are already inside the aria. the slices are large and you can get your pizza and pay in about two minutes."
1,"first time eating there and everything was so yummy! great pizza and salad, my son had the meatball sub he said it was very good, must have been because he wouldn't share. highly recommend."
10,best new york pizza in summerlin and p.o pasta dishes look yummy too!  very friendly staff! please come to la!
27,absolutely avoid this place it's a last resort for me and even then i regret it. undercooked pizza sparse toppings and the rudest employee ever. they need to just shut this place down i've given them so many second chances and will never do it again. when you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! i hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot.
140,"first, it took about 5 minutes of waiting before we were even noticed. then the host told us just to sit wherever (why have a podium and a host if tou have open seating?) our host said it would be another 15 minutes because they stoke the fire at 4, but when we sat down our waiter said it would be 45 minutes. we waited and when we got our pizza it was extremely soggy, we couldnt even hold it without one hand on the bottom. our waiter only showed up once to half fill my water. overall not a good experience. go to a different grimaldi's"
179,it's a great neighbor place. the pizza is great. the salads are airways fresh and the chicken fingers are delicious! always friendly and fast service.
194,one star because i can't tell you if the pizza is any good because every time i call they put me on hold.  first time 10min so figured they forgot i was on hold. so hung up &  called back when they asked if they could put me on hold i said no &  they put me on hold anyway.
113,"great newyork style pizza, crust and dough is really good. lunch with the slice and salad and drink is so bomb for like 4 bucks, maybe the cheapest lunch in town and it good, not just something you eat cause its cheap, you will want to go back again! wings are good and so are the fried mushroom and zucchini sticks."
70,"the pizza is good, a little limited in variety, but that is the traditional thing, i guess. does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out."
163,dominos is dominos. but when i walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. i had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after i ordered. this dominos is slow. drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. edit: our soda was flat. seriously go get ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one
120,"this pizzeria place is terrible. the service was rude and they refused to let us eat our food at the table due to ""health code rules"". we were told that we could eat outside! we were able to order drinks but were told rudely several times that we could not have our pizza until we left the premises. very unacceptable imho"
220,"my boyfriend and i were so excited for this restaurant to open because it's so close to his house! we have been here three different times and were happy each time. i suggest going on wednesdays for wing night! their wings are great! we also enjoyed the pizza, the crust is awesome. the meatballs and cuban sandwich were just okay...which is why i chose 4 stars rather than 5. they also have a great beer selection!"
224,"i have to say, this may be my favorite wood fired pizza in central phoenix. 

i'll have to try spasso's pizza a few more times to confirm that my infatuation was not the result of a long week, my chemical composition on that particular day, or the peace of a cold beer, but if future experiences are anything like my first, i am a fan! 

the house made mozzarella appetizer is ok. the steak (that my boyfriend ate) was fine. the real star here is the pizza, which had a perfectly chewy crust and the meat combination completed a perfect blend of cheesy saltiness. 

the owner was a little overly chatty, but at the same time, how can i blame him when clearly this restaurant is his pet project. the service was great...i don't think our water glasses were ever empty. 

i have to admit, a small part of my enthusiasm is probably because this restaurant is in town & country mall, which is a terribly under appreciated piece of real estate...i'd love to see this good, family-owned restaurant survive."
213,"stopped here for a quick bite before going to dinner. had a delicious slice of pizza with goat cheese, onions, eggplant and heirloom tomatoes. pleasant service also and the place was packed with patrons."
218,"do not eat here!!! i purchased a groupon deal for family meal: large cheese pizza, 20 wings, 2 l soda. worst pizza ever!!we ordered over the phone and picked up the order.it was so greasy, the oil soaked through the box onto my car seat. the flavor is so-so-similar to frozen. the cheese was low quality, the crust was blahh, and the worst part: the sauce was thinly spread.the wings were hard, dry, and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.the soda was the only thing our family can use. we also ordered manicotti,some beach title pizza, and garlic knots. manicotti was okay. beach pizza was same as cheese pizza with only meager toppings thinly spread out. the garlic knots were hard enough to toss like a rock.we had to order from papa john's.it is so true: if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is.."
157,"nice people. very friendly.  provided some free garlic sticks while i waited for my pizza.  i took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    while the pizza was worth $10, i would've felt a little ripped off had i paid the normal price (closer to $18 i believe).  the dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- i found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places.  while there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just ""so-so"" such that i don't really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis.  such is the case here."
84,ordered the pizza on my phone. it said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. went to pick it up. worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet. didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! i'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system? i don't know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. i've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.
37,"with all the talk of rocky's, toppers and ian's, this place has in my opinion the best pizza... i've not tried their regular pizza, but their chicago stuffed style is the best i've had in madison.

and their sandwiches are very good as well. they have a fantastic selection for a pizza delivery place, and they deliver quickly."
6,"fix your store, it is so poorly run that i cannot even go there. there are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!

our neighborhood is not this gross but if i was from outside the area, i would think it's the slums. totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. no excuses.

it also has a foul odor to it...the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks...nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards"
11,"used to be a good place. has gone downhill the last few years. i already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but i was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . 

i ordered to go and when i got their at 8 pm on a saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, i had a feeling something wasn't right. 
spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. one the was spaghetti with meat sauce, i would compare it to a can of chef boyardee. the other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. 

threw them both in the trash

after this meal, i also threw my streets of new york takeout menu in the trash"
46,"did the online order. arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after i'm told it will be a little longer, i'm told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  wtf?!?  so now i'm sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  i wouldn't have ordered if i knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings. nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you've already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question i have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when i get home. i want a nice fresh, hot pizza. not something that's been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!!"
210,"excellent food! great staff! all around a great experience. it's hidden in a strip mall attached to a gas station. who on earth would think this would have been one of my favorite pizza joints in the country? the flavors were amazing. had the guido and zen garden. i loved them both. i'll defiantly be back. go try it, you'll love it."
100,"giordano's is a well known chicago restaurant that's famous for their chicago style stuffed deep dish pizza. they also offer hand stretched thin crust pizza and crispy extra thin pizza. on the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more.

on yelp i read about the long wait times so i planned to try them when they opened. at that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. we were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare. 

we shared an entree sized harvest salad. the salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. this salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it.

during our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. i found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality.

just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering.

i received my individual stuffed plain pizza. the pizza wasn't sliced all the way through and i found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. kinda like a rock. the crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. the very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. although i found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that i found inedible. i don't know if the crust i received is typical of giordano's or not. 

my husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. he said that he was glad that he wasn't hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. he did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the ""other"" chicago place uses.

i really liked the atmosphere and i really enjoyed the well trained servers i encountered.

i would never go back for the pizza i received."
117,nasty! i was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews.  just went to nyc in oct so wanted to compare.  sorry not ny style pizza.
160,"i can't say enough good things about piola. i moved into the building late last year and have probably visited the restaurant, or had take out, close to 10 times already. eating in the staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. taking out they are always fast.

must endorse the san danielle pizza - fresh mozzarella with parma ham, mmmm and do not forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. the diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. the crust here is right up there with terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower.

would also endorse the spaghetti and meatballs, so so tender the meatballs fall apart with a fork and the pasta is perfectly cooked with fresh curls of parmesan all over the top. 

look for the great daily specials - wednesdays is half price bottles of wine! so awesome. i believe kids eat free on sundays too."
219,"i was here with friends a few weeks back and i must say i was quite impressed by the pizza they serve. they have huge pizza on the display which is quite appetising. 

we ordered mushroom pizza and hot lips (i remember pineapple as one of the toppings). hot lips was quite an amusing name!! they give huge slices of pizza and one slice is like a small pizza you get at regular pizza joints. they are also generous with the toppings they give. one slice is totally worth the price!! i prefer adding extra chilli flakes to my pizza as it adds extra zing to the whole experience of eating a hot slice of pizza. for drinks, i recommend the red ribbon mintt ginger dirnk. anytime during the day in hot summer, it is my favorite drink. it also goes well with the pizza. 

i will go back again and if you are in southside with a bunch of friends or by yourself, you should consider visiting this place for a slice of the huge pizza they serve!!"
49,"i was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  i should have saved my money. person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.

bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. we could tell when we opened the box.  the crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  on one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. the other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  

whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  i would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  that hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.

it such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  do i call and complain? do i have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 pm? 

we also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  good meat and tangy sauce.

finally, i was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  i ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.

i really wanted to like this place, especially because i like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. we won't be going back."
205,"the pizza was really good!
they have interesting combinations but everything is really testing. i've been here 3 night in a row.
i recommend this"
94,ordered a pizza a few weeks ago & have to say it was horrible. it seemed almost raw. the crust was cooked but the cheese was white not the golden color on a good pizza. it's a shame because it's so close to home. we've had food from there before but it's been awhile & it use to be good. i guess i'll be sticking with rocco's because they are always consistently good.
111,"ordered for delivery and was told to expect a 40 minute wait, after an hour and a half our cold pizza's arrived. 
 the meat lovers pizza contained tasteless greasy italian sausage, soggy pepperoni, and cold crusty ham slices in extremely sparing amounts.
 the grilled steak chipotle pizza came completely without sauce. nothing better than a cold dry pizza.
 would not recommend to my worst enemies."
100,"it's pretty difficult to find good pizza in las vegas. it's even more difficult to please 2 east coast people that know their pizza. so when my husband and i say that this is good stuff, we really mean it. 

we love the to-go window where you can order by the slice and even an entire pie. let's be honest, it's the perfect stop after a night of drinking."
142,"great pizza, hands down awesome crust and toppings. we had the forager and the balance between mushrooms meatiness and spinach earthiness was spot on. good service and modest price makes this is a winner choice. arugula and delicate squash salad was very unique and not too sweet in spite of the cranberry purée and citrus dressing. give it a try if you are in the mood to try something different."
125,"the service was fast. great pizza. however, as someone with a shellfish allergy, i find it frustrating that this is yet another restaurant where cross-contamination is apparently an issue to the point where everything is grilled together, fried together, and so on."
71,"we came here before a concert at consol center. it's across the street, it was very packed, so leave yourself a lot of time to get a table if you want to eat here. we got lucky & got a table only hour before the concert!! we ordered a pizza & it was good for a bar. good selection of beers!!"
194,the pizza taste just like pizza in  new york .  it has a thin crust  and they cook it in the brick oven. the sauce is so full of flavor.  it is hard to find good pizza anywhere outside of new york but this is the best i have had so far.. im craving it right know. i usually get the pepperoni or add hot peppers to it..
107,"i wanna like this place more. fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza. but the delivery times are sooo bad. worst i've ever experienced anywhere. they are always and forever late. and for the life of me, i can't understand why they can't keep up. every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour. i've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! how is the bad delivery the only thing consistent?? fix it!"
171,"i was craving pizza on friday and decided to stop by. i normally order takeout and have ordered from this place three times previously. my go to is a medium pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and tomato but this time i decided to try out the pizza and wings combo. fridays are busy and my wait time was 45mins. previous visits were a 15min wait. 

a steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their order and they all greeted the owner by name so i guess they are regulars. another thing i noticed was that a customer that came in and ordered 15mins after me received her order before me so i don't know if she received special treatment because she's a regular or that my pizza just took longer to cook lol. 

the pizza here have always been perfectly cooked and the crust crispy and this time it was no different. the wings on the other hand were disappointing and lacking. they were on the smaller end and for a couple dollars more, i would rather get wings at all stars.  

whenever i have a pizza craving, i'll come back."
6,"fast forward

every trip from nyc to pitt includes a visit to aiello's. and if we know anyone driving east, we request a transfer!

if you are in search of fancy ""gourmet"" pizza, go elsewhere.

at aiello's, you order the pizza you specify - and it is absolutely perfect!"
107,i love the idea and execution of custom made pizzas.  the pizza was delicious and it was ready in less than 5 minutes.  i am a fan of this place and will be back.  the place is cool and happy.
78,"this is the best pizza i have ever eaten !!!!  amazingly fast, friendly delivery of the most amazing pizza ever !!!  there is no other pizza joint for me.  ahwatukee rocks!!!"
139,"cashier takes my order for (the last of) cheese pizza while i wait in line to buy cigarettes. 
woman ahead is told her total, her response ""oh yea i forgot, can i get that cheese pizza"" 
why ask me if you're going to make me wait? i didnt forget to order, she did. she should have had to wait. university student vs an employee on a limited break. which was explained to her, minimum wage doesnt inspire much care for the customer... fuck this spot"
15,their pizza is really really good. nice clean space. a little pricey though. you get a pizza with three items and your over 40 bucks!
60,"vegan options in downtown vegas!!! pizza was super tasty and the service was pretty decent. half way through baking my pie they remembered that i only wanted mushrooms on half, so they took it out of the oven and picked them off.  kind of weird, but whatever.  nice gesture, but paws off my pizza! lol."
176,this is a pizza 73 place with a different name same crap pizza and same horrible wings just like 73 only you pay more money for the pizza here then at 73 and it's the exact same product plus it took them one and half hours to deliver it to my  place 10mins away on a wednesday night i'm  being generous with the 1 star rating
144,"i live in cleveland but this store is close to cleveland so they deliver in my area. good pizza, a wide variety on the menu and the price point is spot on. the pizza crust is fresh and the ingredients are fresh as well. i have had the chicken wrap several times and it is huge and enough for two meals. it is fresh chicken and has a great flavor. one time the wrapper was on the dry side though. so next time i order i will mention that . i have had the chicken tenders and they were good as well. they offer a variety of sandwiches hot and cold, chicken wings, pasta dinners, desserts and of course pizza. the shrimp alfredo dinner was very good and had a nice flavor. the sauce was not on the thick side.  i had the pasta dinner with sausage and mushrooms and it was very very good. i have had the cheesecakes there and they are not home made but ok when you have a sweet tooth.  the deliveries are very quick. i went to the actual store and it was clean and i watched them prepare the food and they used gloves. they are always friendly and polite. the store is located off lorain road closer to the fairview bridge and kamn's corner area.  there is plenty of parking and you can bike there if you want."
217,"golly, i would tell people not to go here. i simply ask for four pizzas, two with pepperoni, one with olives, and one with pineapple. they gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. i can't eat meat. i was with another person, who didn't mind the other topping on his pepperoni. i went back to let them know they made a mistake. i was charged for two more pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. i saw someone tell the cook, how the pizzas should be made. once i got my two pizzas, they had pepperoni with olives and pepperoni with pineapples. again! i was on lunch, there was no point for asking to fix this problem again because i had to go back to work. brought it up to them, ask them if i could just get my money back since i can't eat the pizzas they made me. i was told i could not get my money back only credit. i don't want credit because that was my lunch money to eat. i was told by the employees,""mistakes happen."" after i ask for my money back. which i understand mistakes do happen, i work in customers service too. but when i see an employee tell the cook how the pizzas should be made, one with only olives and one with only pineapple, and both pizzas still end up having pepperoni on it. that's not just a mistake. which i still have the receipt that's says cheese pizzas with olives and pineapple."
141,the wait is ridiculous even for being busy. there was an hour before our pizza even went into oven. no pizza is really that worth it. i've had better.
56,"i have been going to the rwb in mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good.  as a vegetarian i have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but i typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad. the eggplant florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  that is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices.   i would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about. the only thing i will say is that i know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold... so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing.  if you are area, i would definitely recommend rwb."
188,"just left and it was my second visit. i really love everything i've ordered so far! the butter pecan shake is to die for. you get pecans in every sip, it's amazing. i am not a soda drinker at all but i love the tractor soda and i wish there was somewhere i could purchase it! the only thing i didn't like today was how long everything took. it already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food. our food also came out all separate. we got our milkshake first, 10 minutes later my bf got his burger and 15
minutes later i got my pizza."
102,"i really enjoyed this place on my recent visit to the aria casino. it's located near the sports book, which was a plus for me.  the pizza was great and they had a nice selection of local craft beer, which was nice since i was visiting from out of town.

5 stars all the way!"
96,"from time to time, my family enjoys a good pizza.  however, the gluten free options are very limited for my youngest son and myself.  we have ordered from dominos, which is really gross.

streets of new york was introduced to us about a year ago.  we have been back several times when we want to have a pizza treat.  we love the food.  

the only issue we have is the wait is often very long for our food and the wait staff seems is always a little on the blah side.  a smile, every once in awhile would be nice.  

we will continue to come back, but i would recommend the wait staff perk up a bit, often you look like you (all) hate being there."
165,pretty run of the mill bad pizza. tasted like re heated tombstone or other home made. but the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok.
224,"customer service from the order taker and driver were decent, but this place serves really, really terrible food. i should have known, but i was drawn by what i thought was an awesome coupon deal. you know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? that's not the case here. it reeked of onions.

the pizza was undercooked and bare. i had the supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. also, i never thought anyone could screw up buffalo wings. it's just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn't even do that. the wings looked unsauced and when i asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. after a closer inspection i understood, and it was right then and there that i realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. the wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. that was most likely the case. i tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future.

i am hoping i can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. i wish i could get a refund, but i don't want to put up a fight just to hear that they won't provide one. potential customers, please do yourself a favor and stay clear; the only valuable thing you'd be ordering here is a life lesson."
187,this is pretty bad pizza. we ordered because it could be delivered to hotel  ...tastes like cardboard very light on toppings...i would never order again. i think it might be frozen digorno. the salads were lettuce w three tomato slices..some of lettuce was turning.
90,"good food in a great location inside the linq promenade. stumbled upon this place after walking all evening and was pleasantly surprised. great pizzas, amazing service. what more can you ask for?"
78,"i just don't get it.  why is this a local favorite?  the pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  i also ordered the chicken parmesan with linguine.  the chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.  they don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.  i'd eat at carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.  the search for good pizza in phoenix continues."
188,"this review is based my latest experience. i have always ordered from magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. i ordered hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. now magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  i used the eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. the food arrived 15 minutes later.  so it took 10 minutes to cook the food. doesn't pizza take longer to cook? the bell peppers were missing from the pizza. it must  have been pre-made. the fingers were greasy and tasted weird. i should have taken a picture. the fries were good. had to throw the fingers out. won't be ordering from there for a while."
135,"honestly this was so good. i have eaten there twice in one week. the pizza was amazing and then we went back for pasta. seriously the service was wonderful and the food yum. but the price was the best part. we had wine, appetizers, salad and full entrees and the bill was ....wait for it....$48 bucks. whoohoo."
59,"first time eating here and was very impressed with ""the cheef"" sandwich, great flavor. friends said the pizza was really good too."
128,"i love the pizza, but i've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. the first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (i think) were pretty bad. i had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. it was cold so we decided to eat inside. the smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. the pizza was good, but i don't think i'll be going back."
170,this is the best pizza & pasta dishes at the lake by far. this place is the real deal starting with the new york atmosphere &  making you feel at home from the start. great food at at very modest price. you will have food left over to take home. the meatballs & sauces are  delicious & all the breads / desserts are made daily  right there. italian food at its finest...
210,last night my family at cicis  pizza.  we hadn't eaten in this restaurant for about a year and boy have they changed.  the restaurant is under staffed.  we went up to the counter quite a few times and there were not any pizza's.  it's hard to believe you go to a pizza buffet and no pizza.  we waited 20 minutes for a desert pizza to be made.  there were a few people working really hard but they needed more people.  the floor had old napkin and it took quite a few minutes for the 1 person to take our used plates away.  we will never go back.
65,"ordered today for lunch for delivery to my workplace. my boss treated us to lunch since it was my birthday.  ordered online and delivery was 6 minutes later than they said it would be but all the food was correct and delicious!  i got a large supreme pizza, lots of wings, and a cookie for under $50 bucks and it fed the whole office.  delivery dude was nice."
141,"this pizza was very flavorful!  we got an all meat one and we were not disappointed.  
we got back to our room at excalibur at around 11:45 after seeing britney spears.  we were starving and decided to call this place.  it was delivered in 45 minutes.  not bad.  it tasted home-made, and the delivery man was a nice man.  
i lived everything about our experience, except for the fact that the woman on the phone who took my order was short in her words, giving me a bit of attitude.  that's the only reason i am not giving a 5-star rating."
114,"one of the very worst pizza hut's i have ever dealt with. they messed up my order, promised me a $15 credit in return, and then rob and tatiana refused to honor the credit. their customer service skills were laughable. rather than giving me a free cheese pizza, rob spent 15 minutes on the phone interrogating me. and tatiana seems to have never had a customer service job prior to this in her entire life. i ended up going to domino's pizza, where i got much better service for the same price."
213,"doughy pizza with a bad sauce. 

plus i ordered mozarella sticks and they did not deliver them, charged me for them, and refused a refund. 

do not support this business."
154,"this is our favorite pizza place in las vegas for more than 10 years now. we just keep coming back!may it be for lunch, dinner or party! yummy pizza, fries, gyros, phily cheesesteak and many more! my kids love their meat lovers and chicken alfredo pizza. ben, the owner is awesome too!  may it be dine in, pick up, take out or delivery... you wont be disappointed!"
221,"bad experienced everrrr!!! never in my life have complained to any businesses but this domino's pizza have the bad service and take forever to have the order ready! took me about  1 hour and 45 minutes (or more) to have my order ready! and gave me attitude!!! what kind of service is thissss????? would never come back here again! ever. 

it deserve 0 star but no choice! anyhowwww, the foods are fine though. if you ever consider ordering pizza from this place. just call in and come pick up in 2 hours! many people were complaining and cancelled orders!!"
56,"we ordered this monday night after a busy work day. generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. not this time. i got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. i phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. i explained how i didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. they proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. i honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. i am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. violently awful and lasted for days now. please beware..."
175,i was amazed by how well the pizza tasted ! my favourite was the goat cheese with sundried tomato & mint. a unique combination which was delicious. the owner was friendly with great customer service.  a definitely a must go to!!!
158,4.5/5! definitely one of toronto's best kept secrets when it comes to thin crust pizza! recommend the antipasti minto to start and the famous bufalina pizza (large enough to share depending on appetite)!
196,"do you know how difficult it is to make a 5-star hawaiian pizza? maybe you don't like hawaiian pizza, maybe you don't care.  but as a lover of hawaiian pizza i can tell you that is very easy to make a 3-star hawaiian pizza and exceedingly difficult to make a 5-star hawaiian pizza.  the one here is it.

the dough was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was delicious. i assume this applies to all of their pizza too. but the pineapples were the perfect size of chunks, plentiful, and did not soak through the dough.  the ham was not thin slices or cold cut ham; but rather thick chunks of cured pork.  add to that a dash of the chilli-olive oil that they bring to the table, and you've basically got the perfect hawaiian pizza.  my dad had a different pizza with chicken and it also looked awesome (he said he loved it though i did not try it).

for dessert i had the tiramisu, and i cannot complain - clearly homemade, terrific balance of sweet and coffee flavouring.

piola is near queen and dufferin, a bit far from the downtown core. i will be back; it is worth the trip!"
16,first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned
22,"this place sucks! the guy was very nice on the phone taking my order, but then 30 min later, i receive some call from gary saying that they do not deliver to me. thanks for letting me know when i placed my order and gave you my cc# already!!
i don't know how the pizza is yet, from other location, because it has yet to arrive. 
waste of time"
49,not sure why all the bad reviews. i've been ordering pizza from this location for a decade and have never had a problem.
52,"super delicious ! now i wish i could of taken a picture of the pizza and cheesesteaks. but they were gone before another thought came up. fresh ingredients, big slices and friendly staff. my new local go to spot for pizza !!"
74,"we love black rock!!! this is the best place to get pizza!! we became fans when they were over on race st. now that they have more room it's even better!!! they also have live music, real pinball tables, and support local charities. my kind of place!!!!!"
26,"first time here with two little boys my 5 yo boy and his 9yo friend. we just came from flipnout extreme and this was the closest dine in pizza place we could find. very happy we came here. the i think manager or owner was very polite and friendly with us making us feel welcome. the pizza we ordered, a small half cheese and pepperoni and garlic bread, was very good!  overall, we would come again. :)"
45,this is one of the best new york style pizza i ever had and the guys are very nice. i definitely will come back to this place.
122,"yummmmm! 
the atmosphere is so comfortable, i especially love the patio area where we like to enjoy a glass of wine and a couple of appetizers. the food is excellent especially the pizza and i think its hard to find good pizza!! this is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family......we do both :)
great food at an excellent value with wonderful service! what more could you possibly want."
159,"cool place.  took my wife and son to the recline and dine (movies.) overall, pretty cool spot to check a flick.  prices are decent, the place is clean, and comfortable.  i like the idea of reclining on a chair.  seats recline and food is served here.  based on previous reviews i was afraid to order food from their pizza place so i have no opinion on the food.  the movie experience was great though."
4,"the pizza is very, very good! we arrived 15 minutes before closing time and the restaurant staff were very accommodating!"
24,"ok for $5 - 6  but not good pizza, no  flavor,  good for young children or anyone else who likes bland pizza!  if they want to charge extra for thin crust they should put it in writing! i would rather give my $5.00 to little cesar's!"
8,"horrible customer service. i have gotten food from here a few times expecting to have a better experience from the last, but i was wrong to hope for that. i once called and they answered ""hold on"" and just put the phone down. after waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. i called back again and they answered ""hold on"" again. i waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. i asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says ""well what do you want to know specials on?"" in a kind of sarcastic tone. we've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. this has happened multiple times. when going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. horrible customer service. the food here is way over priced. the pizza is mediocre. they may use ""fresh ingredients"" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. maybe i would have thought the food was better if i received better service. 

if you want wayyyy better ny pizza go to rockos pizza. way better prices, extremely friendly service, way better everything."
208,"loved this place! went for lunch. and had the bianca with sausage. the pizza came out really quickly and was hot. loved that they have not only grated parm and pepper flakes, but also hot oil. i also asked for a side of sauce (my pizza didn't have it on it) and they brought some with no problem. the space is bright and really welcoming, and the people are friendly. will definitely be back!"
153,completely awful.   ordered a pizza and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the place was only 1/4 busy and they got it wrong twice.  we didn't realize the 2nd screw up until we got home.  we assumed after the 1st screw up and apology they'd get it right. the bartenders were dancing like they wanted to have fun but paid zero attention to our order.   will never go back.
8,"excellent pizza! i travel a lot and one of my favorite things in different cities is to try a locally owned pizza place. delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and breadsticks were hot on arrival and the delivery guy was friendly. 

the breadsticks came with a really flavorful sauce and themselves were perfectly baked and seasoned. the pizza was just a cheese pizza and the ratio of cheese/sauce/crust was on point and tasted great! 

as much pizza as i eat i ought to be considered an expert and if i wasn't leaving town tomorrow i'd be visiting these guys again. great food. thank you!"
28,"waiter was over the top cheesy.  talked too much.  a bit obnoxious.
no gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (ferro's on st. clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free).
one of the specials had risotto as a side so i asked if i could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no.  treated me like i was asking them to make risotto from scratch.
so i ordered a steak instead which was good but if i wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place.
marcello's is clearly stuck in the past....no variety for those with dietary restrictions."
5,"this is probably my favorite bar in pittsburgh.  the pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave...mmmm.  my only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!"
135,"the positives: staff was friendly and the beer was cold. that's it. 

two kids spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing. noodles were cooked fine, the meatballs were small and bland, and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the noodles let alone the entire plate. and for $6 each that's ridiculous. 


we order the mama's supreme pizza. the order took well over 30 min for the pizza. half the crust was burnt. the toppings were limited and the flavor was blah.  

very disappointed and won't be returning."
150,"we ordered after edc last night, we got home and were starving and found their menu slipped under the door of our hotel room, it took over an hour to arrive, then when it got here it was 1 pizza short and we had 1 extra two-liter bottle of pepsi.

when we had ordered, the woman on the phone when we ordered, repeated our order back to us and it did include only 1 pepsi and 3 pizzas instead of the two we got.

i told the delivery guy we didn't order two bottles and he just gave me attitude and said: ""it's what the receipt says, it's just $3 more"".

i didn't care that it was just $3 more, my point was we did not want two pepsi's.

then when we called to complain the woman on the other end of the line also had a shitty attitude saying it wasn't their fault that they took the order wrong and that they're just human, mistakes happen.

they told us we could get the pizza we were missing but we would have to return the extra pepsi and pay the remainder of the cost of the pizza plus it would take another hour to arrive.

worst service and attitude ever."
132,"i've been coming to this sauce for quite a while and its consistently good. i don't think i've ever had a bad experience because i always know what to expect.

the pizza is good, salads are solid, and the mac n' cheese...well, lets just say i'm a sucker it. every time we come to eat here the service is friendly and helpful, probably the best i've had from a ""fast casual"" type of restaurant.

i definitely recommend sauce if you're looking for something fairly quick but delivers on quality."
7,probably one of my favorite pizza places. food is always good and the brick oven is a nice touch you don't see everywhere.
153,we came for sunday lunch. no one here but thats fine with us. service was great. ordered pizza and 8pc chicken combo. 4 of us enjoyed and had leftovers for the week. food is amazing. best chicken ever. kfc who?
147,"we ordered on a wednesday at around 5:30 pm. the order arrived by 6 and was fresh and hot. it was, however, missing the potato wedges which we called the store about. they were redelivered about 45 minutes later. after calling about the wedges (which my daughter really wanted, so she didn't eat), we realized one of the pizzas was missing half the toppings. decided not to call. the online ordering was good but does not allow for 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. not really family friendly.

sorry pizza 73, not gonna order again."
22,"i came here based on the great reviews on yelp. i have never had georgian food before. i was mostly interested in trying the hachapuri (georgian pizza shaped like a boat with an egg on top). it is the coolest thing i have ever seen on yelp. 

so we got here on an afternoon to have some lunch. the restaurant just opened but there was already a party inside! the servers are really nice and really cute :o. lol. anyway, we wanted to get a hachapuri and some khinkali (georgian dumplings). there were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. let me say upon arrival of our food i was shocked by how generous the portions were! the khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. and the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. we both loved the food. the khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. i needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. their sauces are really tasty btw. they come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side.

the food was so memorable! i would love to come back to try some other georgian dishes. i think though, the place could use some natural lighting, it is very dim inside."
68,"giordano's is a great italian/chicago style restaurant that i highly recommend! the negative reviews on this place's wait times and busyness should not count against it. this restaurant just opened no more than 5 months ago, it is located on the busy p83 strip with tons of people and near the arrowhead mall, and is only a moderate sized restaurant. 
     when my husband and i first arrived we heard the wait was almost 2 hours but for a party of 5+ - for just me and my husband we were sat right away. large families/parties need to realize that places that have just opened up are going to be super busy and have long wait times - its common sense. we sat at a small side table and were not too shocked at how busy and compacted everyone was. we expected it and were happy to see all the buzz around the place. our waiter got our drinks immediately and walked us through the menu. he warned us about a large party that had just arrived and that we needed to put any pizza order in soon other wise it would be over an hour wait for a chicago style pizza. 
     my husband and i wanted to go a different route and ordered a pasta and sandwich instead. the wait time on the pizza was not a negative strike to us - we knew hand making a pizza from scratch takes time and we were more interested in the other dishes anyways. my husband ordered the italian beef sandwich and i ordered the marinara spaghetti while we shared the giordano's sampler. the food was fantastic and i'll be posting pictures of it too. it was rich and flavorful with a real taste of care and love. the only negative part of the meal was that everything came out all together and quite quickly. i believe my husband and i waited just over 10 minutes to get our appetizers, salads, and entrees. our table almost couldn't fit it all. i ended up having to not finish my salad because i did not want my entree to get cold. 
     other than that my husband and i had a great meal and really enjoyed the atmosphere. we also appreciated our waiter and his thoughts in items on the menu that were best for us and our time frame. i will definitely be back to have more from this delicious establishment - but with a party no larger than 3 i think for the next few months."
