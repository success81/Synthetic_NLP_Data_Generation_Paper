0,4,Positive,"in the heart of chinatown, i discovered it enroute to kensington market one day. it's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there. first experience was very positive - would definitely return!

atmosphere: small space. think banh mi boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. vibe is casual. free wifi is nice.

service: okay. staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.

price: average. depends on the size of pizza you order.the small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one very hungry person.  pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)


food: my friends and i were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. it wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised every other table around us only had pasta on them. guess we gotta come back to try! we did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. so will definitely come back.

here's the pizza we ordered:

peking duck pizza - very tasty! rich flavours that work well. but it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.

margherita - good, but not the best. i recommend trying the more ""special"" toppings instead.

shall return, and/or try other locations."
1,5,Positive,"first time eating there and everything was so yummy! great pizza and salad, my son had the meatball sub he said it was very good, must have been because he wouldn't share. highly recommend."
2,5,Positive,"so i don't give out 5 stars frivolously, but this place deserves it. everything i had (summer rolls, vegan pizza burger and chocolate chip cookies) was delicious. the service was great and the waitress helped me narrow down the never ending yummy looking options on the menu. they even gave me a smoothie sample while i waited.

next time i'm in cleveland, i'll definitely stop back in. i may even be coming for dinner today."
3,5,Positive,"my absolutely favorite mushroom pizza in the city, great brunch spot - really reasonable and you can always get a table, because it's really big and has indoor and outdoor space.  i think the ice cream is homeade.  a neighbourhood favorite!"
4,4,Positive,"the pizza is very, very good! we arrived 15 minutes before closing time and the restaurant staff were very accommodating!"
5,5,Positive,"this is probably my favorite bar in pittsburgh.  the pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave...mmmm.  my only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!"
6,5,Positive,"fast forward

every trip from nyc to pitt includes a visit to aiello's. and if we know anyone driving east, we request a transfer!

if you are in search of fancy ""gourmet"" pizza, go elsewhere.

at aiello's, you order the pizza you specify - and it is absolutely perfect!"
7,5,Positive,probably one of my favorite pizza places. food is always good and the brick oven is a nice touch you don't see everywhere.
8,5,Positive,"excellent pizza! i travel a lot and one of my favorite things in different cities is to try a locally owned pizza place. delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and breadsticks were hot on arrival and the delivery guy was friendly. 

the breadsticks came with a really flavorful sauce and themselves were perfectly baked and seasoned. the pizza was just a cheese pizza and the ratio of cheese/sauce/crust was on point and tasted great! 

as much pizza as i eat i ought to be considered an expert and if i wasn't leaving town tomorrow i'd be visiting these guys again. great food. thank you!"
9,4,Positive,"we like the manhattan family feast. $41.99 for a really big 1 topping pizza, hot wings, fries, and a large salad. i do wish another salad came with it since we're big salad eaters. good food. good price. prompt and courteous service."
10,5,Positive,best new york pizza in summerlin and p.o pasta dishes look yummy too!  very friendly staff! please come to la!
11,5,Positive,"this is my last stop on the reign of terror of vegan hotspots in downtown las vegas.  it's a pizza shop in the plaza hotel with a vegan slice called the soho.  it's pretty majestic, including spinach, artichoke, and the daiya cheese we all love.  the crust is chewy and delicious.  at other times (like daytime) they offer a vegan soft serve in chocolate and vanilla.  in my case, my 2am pizza trip also featured a drunk twenty year old hitting on me. thumbs up!"
12,4,Positive,"loved the pizza. they had a great selection. services wasn't bad. the wings are also tasty. it was the breakfast of champions!

 ; ^ d"
13,5,Positive,they have such good pizza. omg their cheesecake is to die for literally. i think i am addicted to the cheesecake.
14,5,Positive,"i went to their pizza ""rodizio"" yesterday, which is happening every thursday of this month. for those who still don't know what a rodizio is, i'm saving you a google search: you pay an amount and waiters keep bringing you food until you say you're full or you explode, whatever happens first.

i was expecting to eat just pizza, but they had a small pasta and salad buffet that was included in the price of $20/person. the lasagna was awesome - of course i didn't try everything because i was there for the pizza, after all.

the pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds. the ""portuguese"" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion.

please, go ahead and make your reservation. you won't be sorry."
15,5,Positive,their pizza is really really good. nice clean space. a little pricey though. you get a pizza with three items and your over 40 bucks!
16,5,Positive,"custom built pizza with high quality, fresh ingredients, a decent price, what else could you ask for? oh, and it tastes really really really good!"
17,5,Positive,"great pizza. my friends and i go here a lot. good pizza, good wings, good restaurant."
18,4,Positive,"this is a fun place with a trendy atmosphere. it's one of the few places in town that allow you to mix and match beer flights at a fair price. the food is fun and tasty. i recommend the mussels, pizzas, and wings."
19,5,Positive,"one of the best ny style pizzas in the city.  location is not much to look at on the outside, but very clean and fresh on the inside.  plenty of parking."
20,5,Positive,this probably one of the best pizza i ever eaten. we order a large pepperoni and salami . it was so good. when im in town  again i will be coming here
21,5,Positive,"i recently went to this restaurant with a group of friends as i had heard so many positive reviews and must say artigiani definately lived up to expectations. this resto serves up one  of the best wood oven pizza's in montreal.their  pizza is thin crust  and  they a have wide variety of pizza's that will please your pallette.  ambiance is cozy and modern decor. they also serve up a great seafood pasta dish for all you seafood lovers and must not forget to mention their fried calamari entree. lastly, be sure to leave room for their wonderful tiramisu dessert served in a gelato glass. would definately recommend!"
22,4,Positive,"i came here based on the great reviews on yelp. i have never had georgian food before. i was mostly interested in trying the hachapuri (georgian pizza shaped like a boat with an egg on top). it is the coolest thing i have ever seen on yelp. 

so we got here on an afternoon to have some lunch. the restaurant just opened but there was already a party inside! the servers are really nice and really cute :o. lol. anyway, we wanted to get a hachapuri and some khinkali (georgian dumplings). there were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. let me say upon arrival of our food i was shocked by how generous the portions were! the khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. and the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. we both loved the food. the khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. i needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. their sauces are really tasty btw. they come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side.

the food was so memorable! i would love to come back to try some other georgian dishes. i think though, the place could use some natural lighting, it is very dim inside."
23,4,Positive,solid pizza. maybe slightly on the rich side but sometimes that's what you're looking for! went for this when pizzaiolo was closed last night and was very happy with the decision.
24,4,Positive,"just ordered a pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and onion.,,really good pizza!! spinach dip is also really good! good place to go!! yum!!"
25,5,Positive,24 hour service!  702-333-8000exceptional chicken fettuccine alfredo! white pizza is to die for!!! everything is homemade i love it. 24hr delivery and pick up. the owner is super friendly!!! 5 stars!!!!!
26,5,Positive,"first time here with two little boys my 5 yo boy and his 9yo friend. we just came from flipnout extreme and this was the closest dine in pizza place we could find. very happy we came here. the i think manager or owner was very polite and friendly with us making us feel welcome. the pizza we ordered, a small half cheese and pepperoni and garlic bread, was very good!  overall, we would come again. :)"
27,5,Positive,"fantastic meal, pizza made just like we wanted it. they added pepperoni to half of our bacon & blue with barely a raised eye. great atmosphere and the service (alex) was by far the best we had during our entire stay. friendly staff, and just a stellar meal."
28,5,Positive,"first time here.  checked in and got the pepperoni cheese stick for free.  it was great. 

the service was very welcoming as they checked to make sure if everything was ok. 
the dining area was roomy and my son had room to stretch his legs and did not felt pressure to just sit there-felt very welcoming. 

ordered chicken wings with garlic ranch. omg so glad we did,  it was amazing. the chicken was crispy with a nice crunch with every bite and did i mentioned the garlic.  it was so delicious!

the xl pizza was huge with a crispy crust and a soft bottom texture that was not overly oily with every bite.  the topping were really tasty with half of it topped with pepperoni,  black olives, and sausages.  the other half had pepperoni,  onions,  and bacon.  to spice it up we asked for jalapeno on the side.

will definitely return."
29,5,Positive,"this was my second time in the last few months meeting a friend for lunch at
luciano garden restaurant.  it is not far from my home.  the restaurant was perfect for conversation, and very comfortable.  the pizza is the best pizza i have had in a long time in the las vegas area.  the chopped salad was a generous portion with a lovely light dressing.  i plan to have dinner with my husband in the near future and am looking forward to trying some of their seafood, pasta dishes."
30,5,Positive,my favorite giordanos in az! the service and food is perfection. what i appreciate about it is that it's the closest tasting pizza compared to my hometown of chicago. we love deep dish and the crust doesn't disappoint. the sauce is well seasoned which is also something i pay attention to. this is our family spot.
31,5,Positive,"almost walked out as soon as we walked in, looked kind of sketchy. very happy we decided to order though. the pizza was unbelievable, i think this might have been one of the best crusts i have ever had. thoroughly enjoyed every bite!!  though it may not look like much from the outside, pizza here is a must try."
32,4,Positive,"with a patio sheltered from the noise of 17th avenue (and growing the herbs used in most of the dinner items) a very large dining space and a menu full of excellent scodellina options, cibo is a great place for chatty drinks with the girls, chatty pasta with your family or pizza sharing with your date.

far from classic, cibo takes italian and turns it calgarian with modern menu items, super-fresh, super local ingredients in dishes you can't help but share and hipster-turned-friendly servers willing to laugh with the guests.

cibo is bustling with the hippest of pizza connoisseurs laughing over fig and gorgonzola pie, the trendiest of the uptown 17th sharing smoked black cod anitpesto and the coolest of calgary shouting ""you gotta try this!"" passing house-made olives to the next table; all this activity set firmly on the backbone of simply great food.

cibo is fun, it's fun to hang out at for a drink, it's fun to talk to people there and it's a fun place to eat.

33,4,Positive,"i called and spoke to the owner, he was very genuine and concerned and sent me a pizza on the house the following night and it arrived exactly at 7:30 with apologies from the driver. 
their pizza is so good that i am totally thrilled that they've fixed the delivery glitch so quickly.
kudos to you."
34,5,Positive,"i thought everything was fantastic.  the food was incredible, the drinks were strong and remarkably tasty, and the feeling at the restaurant was just very upbeat and lively.  to begin we had wine and a bourbon based pre made cocktail. i really liked the ingenuity of the cocktail where you're given a bottle instead of having to wait for the crafting each time. we then had the tuna cones, mushroom flatbread, and the brussel sprout salad. the ahi cones had a nice kick with the sauce and the presentation was awesome. the flatbread had more of a pizza feel than your typical flatbread which i enjoyed tremendously. the brussel spirit salad was a nice side with whole pieces of bacon and apple rather than sprinkled as per usual. i like this heartier rendition better. the ambiance of the bar is really nice and the staff were great. i really wish i had a casual bar like this closer to my house on the west side. prices are very high so it's not a weekly dining venue, but i highly recommend trying it out if you're looking for a new cocktail bar with amazing food on the strip."
35,4,Positive,"they have good service, beer selection, and the pizza we got was fantastic. their spinach dip was more of typical bar food, just alright."
36,4,Positive,"i stopped in here for a slide and a soda one day and was very pleased. this is real deal great pizza, plus a great atmosphere and fair price. i have also since learned that this pizza is the go-to for many local businesses, who all swear by it for their lunch purposes."
37,5,Positive,"with all the talk of rocky's, toppers and ian's, this place has in my opinion the best pizza... i've not tried their regular pizza, but their chicago stuffed style is the best i've had in madison.

and their sandwiches are very good as well. they have a fantastic selection for a pizza delivery place, and they deliver quickly."
38,5,Positive,delicious huge slices for reasonable prices. they bring the pizza to your table and they also have wifi.
39,4,Positive,the pepperoni pizza i had was well done and my husband had a cheese pizza he very much enjoyed. i disappointed not to see some yummy chicken tenders. preferably in a hot style. besides pizza there was nothing really else on the menu that i desired to try. definitely come back for the pizza specially for the price it's a good deal.
40,5,Positive,"went for my birthday dinner. so yummy! the decor is absolutely amazing. i fell in love, so classy, so chic, perfect for my bday celebration. i wanted pizza and what a good choice it was! we started with the chicken artichoke bruschetta! excellent. then had the four cheese pizza adding spinach. delicious. then they brought me a yummy dessert  i loved it!"
41,5,Positive,i ordered from here and i was a little skeptical. but the food came fast it was fresh and delicious plus the driver was very pleasant. the prices are very fair 2 pizzas for 20 bucks with delivery and 24 hour service. cant beat it. i will definitely order from here time and time again.
42,4,Positive,"i ordered 2 xl pizzas, the mama mia and the grilled garlic chicken. they were incredible. i ordered them earlier in the morning to be ready at 11:30 for lunch. when i walked in a few minutes before 11:30 they were just coming out of the oven. they were hot and fresh. great service. everyone on my crew loved the pizza. i will definitely be back"
43,4,Positive,angelia`s pizza is a very solid go-to pie at a pretty reasonable price. try some of the specialty pizzas you cannot go wrong! it would be nice to have a dining room to sit down and eat after the moon games and practices!  we will continue to enjoy your pizza!
44,5,Positive,"best pizza place in vegas 
they have really great customer service. they take the time to speak with you and get to know you. i would really recommend to stop by and try their pizza. my favorite is the real deal, it's the real deal."
45,5,Positive,this is one of the best new york style pizza i ever had and the guys are very nice. i definitely will come back to this place.
46,5,Positive,"delicious pizza! i had the lambretta special pizza, minus the prosciutto because i was in the mood for vegetarian (i'm sure it's delicious with the prosciutto too though). it was huge but it was thin crust and it was all i was having and i was hungry so i ate the whole thing myself!

the service was very fast and friendly, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were very pleasant and modern. 

i will definitely come back here! the pizza was made from high quality, authentic ingredients, and i didn't feel stuffed in a bad way like i do at other pizza places. i felt great afterwards."
47,5,Positive,"the place doesn't look the best but food is excellent and the service is fantastic!  my husband always gets pizza or open face roast beef n gravy. i get lasagna (which gives me 3meals) or a sandwich. my granddaughter's love to go there. they get there own personal pizza which is huge. big jim's was also on ""diners, drive in and dives"". guy showed the spaghetti being made, he gave the recipe. also, i forgot to mention they have the best wedding soup in pittsburgh."
48,5,Positive,"it's not that i'm 9 months pregnant that i was able to eat an entire pizza here, but that the pizza here is that good! first time trying it but will be back again (soon i hope)! very clean place, very friendly guys helping us with how to order and very good pizza (had i mentioned that?). many thumbs up cbp!!!"
49,5,Positive,not sure why all the bad reviews. i've been ordering pizza from this location for a decade and have never had a problem.
50,4,Positive,great pizza but lacks consistency. lots of toppings to choose  from. needs more choices  in dipping sauces.
51,4,Positive,best gluten free vegan pizza in the world!!!
52,5,Positive,"super delicious ! now i wish i could of taken a picture of the pizza and cheesesteaks. but they were gone before another thought came up. fresh ingredients, big slices and friendly staff. my new local go to spot for pizza !!"
53,5,Positive,"we headed in for lunch on a weekday, and were seated right away. our server's name was chris, and he was very prompt and courteous. we each ordered pizza and shared and it was fantastic! the diavallo and the boss were so good. the margherita wasn't bad either. i can't wait to go back and try some more!"
54,4,Positive,"we ate there friday night and it was an absolute delight.

scott the owner, the staff and the décor was very inviting.

the pizza was very good. the combination of the tasty crust, the right amount of sauce and a fresh mozzarella along with quality toppings makes it the best pizza i've had in arcadia area. it was even tasty the next day.

what i liked about it the most is that they're not trying to be a fancy place or going all snobby on the food as the arcadia area restaurants do way too much.  they obviously just want to be a pizza parlor offering a good pizza, at a fair price and they seem to be doing a good job of it.

they also have byob, you can bring in your own bottle of wine or beer and drink it with your food. i don't why but i find this kind of cool

we will definitely be back."
55,5,Positive,"i heard this place was good and it was. i ordered a personal sized cheese pizza with no extra toppings for $7.50. and it was good. they make it like pizza brutta on monroe st, where instead of being covered with a layer of cheese it has a few dollops. novonta pulls that off (pizza brutta did too). novonta's crust was good, and the rest of the pizza was even better. i really got just a plain cheese pizza, but there was more to it. some sort of basil or spinach leaves in there... i don't know but it was good. it also only took like 2 minutes to make."
56,4,Positive,"i have been going to the rwb in mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good.  as a vegetarian i have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but i typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad. the eggplant florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  that is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices.   i would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about. the only thing i will say is that i know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold... so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing.  if you are area, i would definitely recommend rwb."
57,5,Positive,"yes! i'm officially addicted to this pizza. honestly, the only good new york style pizza in madison. i'm originally from new jersey (yes, i am aware that is *not* new york) so i've missed a good thin crust.

so far, the eggplant pizza is my favorite. i mean, i've liked all the ones i had. i think the ratio of the ingredients is good.

i ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like i was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza i was going to consume. they give a good amount of salad! the feta in the mediterranean salad is super yummy, though on the salty side.

i went there again today, after ordering delivery yesterday. i don't plan on going tomorrow, but we will see."
58,5,Positive,staff is always nice and their pizza is awesome! the wings are good too! and so many other things! great place to eat.
59,5,Positive,"first time eating here and was very impressed with ""the cheef"" sandwich, great flavor. friends said the pizza was really good too."
60,4,Positive,"vegan options in downtown vegas!!! pizza was super tasty and the service was pretty decent. half way through baking my pie they remembered that i only wanted mushrooms on half, so they took it out of the oven and picked them off.  kind of weird, but whatever.  nice gesture, but paws off my pizza! lol."
61,5,Positive,authentic italian pizza made with fresh ingredients! do yourself a favor and place an order tonight! personally love the quattro formaggio pizza!
62,4,Positive,"after seeing hash house a go go on a food network show, my hubby wanted to go for the famous chicken and waffles for sunday brunch. 
we arrived around 10:40 and were immediately seated ina large booth in the corner. our friendly server came over right away and took drinks orders while explaining a few particularly popular many items. 
items chosen; chicken waffles (he loved it), apple-cinnamon pancake (yummy and seriously the size of a medium pizza!), kids hamburger (huge, said to be a little oily tasting), and egg white scramble with avocado and sweet potato fries (good). 
while the portions are easily large enough for 2 people to share, one will not be disappointed if comfort foods is your hankering."
63,4,Positive,"upper crust is like grimaldi's on steroids. the two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. upper crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which i am not crazy about. the wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey bbq sauce. the meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but stephanie h would disagree. happy hour is monday-friday 4pm to 7pm and on wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine. 

overall, it is a very good pizza and i plan on returning. next time i'll be giving that pizza cookie a try. i really liked upper crust, but grimaldi's in old town is still my favorite for traditional ny style thin crust pizza."
64,5,Positive,"i have to say that not only is the food amazing, the employees are extremely friendly. they went as far to fulfill my request to draw john snow from game of thrones (easily the best pizza place ever!) thank you so much!"
65,4,Positive,"ordered today for lunch for delivery to my workplace. my boss treated us to lunch since it was my birthday.  ordered online and delivery was 6 minutes later than they said it would be but all the food was correct and delicious!  i got a large supreme pizza, lots of wings, and a cookie for under $50 bucks and it fed the whole office.  delivery dude was nice."
66,5,Positive,this place is always great my husband and i love ordering from them not only are they extremely fast when it comes to delivery but they are super friendly their pizza is top notch whenever i take a bite i feel like i'm in italy! this is the place to order from if you don't feel like cooking and are too much of a bum to go outside :)
67,4,Positive,"excellent thin crust pizzas with great toppings and an ok selection of local craft beers. take away a giant slice for $5!

absolutely the most affordable dining option at aria. and the monopoly machines are right outside too!"
68,4,Positive,"giordano's is a great italian/chicago style restaurant that i highly recommend! the negative reviews on this place's wait times and busyness should not count against it. this restaurant just opened no more than 5 months ago, it is located on the busy p83 strip with tons of people and near the arrowhead mall, and is only a moderate sized restaurant. 
     when my husband and i first arrived we heard the wait was almost 2 hours but for a party of 5+ - for just me and my husband we were sat right away. large families/parties need to realize that places that have just opened up are going to be super busy and have long wait times - its common sense. we sat at a small side table and were not too shocked at how busy and compacted everyone was. we expected it and were happy to see all the buzz around the place. our waiter got our drinks immediately and walked us through the menu. he warned us about a large party that had just arrived and that we needed to put any pizza order in soon other wise it would be over an hour wait for a chicago style pizza. 
     my husband and i wanted to go a different route and ordered a pasta and sandwich instead. the wait time on the pizza was not a negative strike to us - we knew hand making a pizza from scratch takes time and we were more interested in the other dishes anyways. my husband ordered the italian beef sandwich and i ordered the marinara spaghetti while we shared the giordano's sampler. the food was fantastic and i'll be posting pictures of it too. it was rich and flavorful with a real taste of care and love. the only negative part of the meal was that everything came out all together and quite quickly. i believe my husband and i waited just over 10 minutes to get our appetizers, salads, and entrees. our table almost couldn't fit it all. i ended up having to not finish my salad because i did not want my entree to get cold. 
     other than that my husband and i had a great meal and really enjoyed the atmosphere. we also appreciated our waiter and his thoughts in items on the menu that were best for us and our time frame. i will definitely be back to have more from this delicious establishment - but with a party no larger than 3 i think for the next few months."
69,4,Positive,"tldr: great spot for a slice of late night pizza on de la montagne just under st. catherine. 

pizza chez danny makes tasty pizza that will squash your late night craving. the crust is thin and crisp on the bottom, but soft on top. the addition of sesame seeds on the top adds a delicious nuttiness to every bite of the sweet crust. the mixed cheese of the simple cheese pizza melts into yummy goodness and sits on a light dose of tomato sauce. with tax, the slice came out to around $3, and it was delicious. i definitely recommend this place for your americanized pizza itch."
70,4,Positive,"before you eat here you have to know that this restaurant has been around for 37 years! that is amazing for any restaurant. restaurants come and go, but this one has stood the test of time...and you""ll definitely notice that the decor, although clean and super comfortable, is understatedly retro.

i liked the vibe here. there's a fair sized restaurant area and a large lounge with a cozy brick fireplace. it's usually packed friday and saturday nights.

the owner's son played with the calgary stampeders once upon a time, so there's lots of stampeder memorabilia. it wouldn't be completely unrealistic to see some football players digging into some steaks while you're eating. 

my friends and i had pizza, greek salad and caesar salad. the greek salad was delicious and had some bonus creaminess to it. the caesar (large) was nice and garlicky and came with a generous side of garlic toast.

we had the ambrosia pizza (think spinach, artichoke hearts  feta) and the athenian pizza (think feta and olives). both had toppings that blended together in the most amazing way! i would order both again.

service was great - attentive, polite and friendly.

this restaurant has a solid menu; is comfortable and laid back; and has some friendly employees who obviously enjoy what they do."
71,5,Positive,"we came here before a concert at consol center. it's across the street, it was very packed, so leave yourself a lot of time to get a table if you want to eat here. we got lucky & got a table only hour before the concert!! we ordered a pizza & it was good for a bar. good selection of beers!!"
72,5,Positive,super yummy pizzas and salads! not a ton of seating area indoors. bar across the hall so you can get any drink you like.
73,4,Positive,"i have no idea of the history of this place, but it has one. they also use the same sourdough starter for the pizzas for about 50 years. the waitress explained this too me, but all i know is the pizza turned out pretty good. our version had giant pieces of pepperoni, a dabble of grilled jalapeno and purple onion. this not really ny style as i was barely able to fold the thing, but it was all about that sourdough crust. in a surprise though, the pizza did not taste good reheated. another surprise was the ""check in"" on facebook and get an order of chicken tenders for $2. these were small, hot and crunchy little tenders which were quite good. they have an upstairs with games and of course all the funky stuff is fun to check out. half the patio is covered also, so that is a good thing."
74,5,Positive,"we love black rock!!! this is the best place to get pizza!! we became fans when they were over on race st. now that they have more room it's even better!!! they also have live music, real pinball tables, and support local charities. my kind of place!!!!!"
75,5,Positive,"trying out a new greek place today and so happy i did! went to hummus for lunch. this is a great concept i like. blaze pizza did it and so does hummus. a chipotle style built your own bowl or wrap. lots of great options! i went with the bowl today and i loved it! delicious and the healthiest thing i've had in days, just a real feel good meal. i thought having hummus on the bottom would be weird, but i worked great. the lamb was wonderful and i love the whole scoop of feta. will definitely be back especially since it's so close to my place in anthem."
76,4,Positive,"pizza was pretty authentic, i am a new yorker so always looking for good pizza. also, tried the cannoli and it was awesome."
77,4,Positive,"if you like thin greasy pizza, then alexander's pizza is good for you. the $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and i do admit the flavor is marginally better than caesar's $5 pizza. the only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking wet from being drenched in oil. 

alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals. the pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! it's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard."
78,5,Positive,"this is the best pizza i have ever eaten !!!!  amazingly fast, friendly delivery of the most amazing pizza ever !!!  there is no other pizza joint for me.  ahwatukee rocks!!!"
79,5,Positive,"great pizza, great price! 
always walk in here for a slice and a pop when i'm in the durham region for work. service is good and quick. pizza is delicious. they seem to doing a good business as a lot of people walk in to pick up their pizzas. price is very good, cheaper than most places."
80,4,Positive,"ordered the gluten free pesto party pizza. it was so delicious i ate the whole pizza save for one slice i gave to a co-worker. they lose a star because i felt nickel and dimed for everything. i ordered my pizza carry out and got charged for one ranch and hot peppers, and i almost got charged for a water cup because i wanted one with a lid but the guy behind the register was nice enough to just give it to me.  so after the gluten free crust (which i expect to pay extra for) and the little condiments, and tip i spent $18 on a personal pizza. a little on the pricey side for lunch."
81,5,Positive,"my wife and i are pizza snobs.  we've tried a lot of pizza places in the 10 years we've lived here and no one compares to rino d's.  they are just that good.  

we love the white pizzas and the chicken pesto.  they have good appetizers and the deserts are good.  the calzones are pretty good too, just a touch greasy.  we always order delivery.  they get here pretty fast (of course we live just a couple blocks away).  

i love all the coupons they have and their rewards program is awesome.  i've never received so many free pizzas anywhere in my life.   their delivery drivers are very nice, friendly and polite.  i highly recommend them.  but taste around first if you must.  you won't be disappointed."
82,5,Positive,"this pizza was great.  pizza sauce makes a good pizza and this was outstanding.  great service.  loved the ""chandelier"".  great experience."
83,5,Positive,"okay... another check in. there is no doubt this is one of my ""go to"" places to eat and i will continue to go back! on this visit i asked for a giant slice with extra sauce on top! in my previous reviews i already noted that the pizza is excellent! awesome crust, awesome cheese, and an amazing sauce. also worthy of noting that they are consistent... it's always awesome!

i know it's weird. lol i thought of asking for extra sauce on top because there is a place in brooklyn i used to go to all the time called l & b spumoni gardens. i know extra sauce is a boring for a pizza topping but let me tell you it was delicious!!!!!! mmmmm!! mmmm!! even this photo makes my mouth water!"
84,5,Positive,by far my favorite pizza in town! the deep dish is to die for and so is their service! i have eaten here countless times and have never been let down!
85,4,Positive,"pizza, pizza, pizza. love it. nello's is a good laid back place to get together with some family and/or friends and have lots of options for pizza and sald, and knock a few back. service is about 4 stars too."
86,5,Positive,"had lunch with my wife here.  she's colombian and felt it had some traditional colombian flavors with more modern simple dishes.  i mention the colombian part as there are really no restaurants close by with rice, beans, sweet plantains, empanadas, and steak.  was very good quick and attentive service.  for $5.99 she got the dinner portion with soup.  i tried the grilled chicken over salad with avocados beans and corn was delicious and will definitely go here again.   one of the reviews picked up food for take out and i understand his feelings as haven eaten many colombian meals prepared by her mom, her aunts, many places in florida, puerto rico and in dominican republic this food is just best eaten right away.  try it out, for the area it's great to have another option other than bbq, chinese, or pizza."
87,5,Positive,"peter piper is arizona's family oriented pizza chain. most people think the pizza is complete garbage and often describe it as cardboard, but i think it's just plain great."
88,5,Positive,"i used to work as a waitress at this restaurant's original incarnation (amelio's est. 1985) in 2003 when i was at university so i can you that not only is the food delicious, this is a lovely family restaurant that treats its staff very well. 

i thought they'd closed down so i was ecstatic when my boyfriend found out they reopened as amelia's with the daughter at the helm, how wonderful to see this awesome family business continue past its 30th year! i love supporting local companies and this is the real deal.

now on to the food! there's a reason that every crop of mcgill students learns of amelia's and quickly sees it as a staple. not only are the prices reasonable, it's byo and group-friendly for before a big night out. it was not uncommon when i worked there for groups of 8 to show up with a couple of boxes of wine and have a great time before hitting the night life. now i happen to prefer a better quality to drink myself, but love that this joint is casual enough to cater to that crowd and nice enough to suit my needs as a young professional as well. 

the white pizza (5-cheese) is a must. i highly recommend sharing one small, medium or large with your table as it's a little intense to eat alone but absolutely to die for. you must try it as nature intended, but a great hack from my waitressing days is to ask them to add tomato slices & garlic for even more flavour. just adding mushrooms is another fav. 

the florentine pizza with artichoke hearts and spinach is also amazing, and often gets overshadowed by the white but very subtle and delicious flavors. only available as a small, so bear that in mind! the vegetarian is delicious and has a sauce base that includes eggplant. the reuben pizza is basically a smoked meat sandwich in a pizza, complete with sauerkraut and mustard on the side - definitely not for the faint of heart but we'll worth it if you love meat and want the adventure. if you're a first-timer i'd definitely suggest splitting that with a more standard pizza,  though. or the white :)

you really can't go wrong with the pizzas, and any small can be done in whole wheat dough which is great if you wanna be a bit healthier. they aren't intended to be italian-style thin crust pizzas so do be aware of that. the crust is fluffy, buttery, almost pastry-like (i believe they use crisco shortening in the dough) so expect more of a new york style slice. i almost never eat crusts from pizzas but i always finish theirs, they're so good!! 

the little salads that come with each order are lovely and give you that valuable extra greenery before say, eating 5 melted cheese on dough!! and their subs and pastas are great too, but the pizzas really do shine here. 

if you get dessert, the cheesecake was always my favourite, and all desserts are made in-house.

note that it's cash only, so come prepared! one of my fav things to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at cinema du parc. they stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly.

you will have an awesome meal, promise :)"
89,4,Positive,my boyfriend and i came in here for the first time for dinner. i had lasagna and my boyfriend had the waiter by the name of jared build him a pizza it was very good and we had chicken wings. the restaurant was very clean but it felt a little warm in here. i would recommend this place to my friends. we will be back to try their chicken.
90,5,Positive,"good food in a great location inside the linq promenade. stumbled upon this place after walking all evening and was pleasantly surprised. great pizzas, amazing service. what more can you ask for?"
91,4,Positive,"pop up pizza was conveniently located next to the elevator going to my room, so of course i had to try it. if you're staying at plaza, look out for their coupon too! my welcome booklet came with a deal on two slices of cheese and a drink, but i just asked if i could pay a little extra for toppings.

the storefront is cool looking and they were playing a lot of dubstep...probably because it was edc week. the workers there were friendly, and even though there is no soda fountain outside, you can still get free refills of your drink by asking.

i got a slice of their white chapel pizza (ricotta and spinach) as well as a generic meat lovers. the white chapel is sooo goooood! the other one was tasty too, but i preferred the white chapel despite the lack of meat. the slices are pretty big, and i really liked the crisp yet chewy crust. dare i say i liked it better than secret pizza, a vegas joint on the strip that also has ny style pizza? what they have on this place is location, but pop up pizza is cheaper, faster, and equally (if not more) delicious. 

food: 4, service: 4, environment: 4, price: 3"
92,5,Positive,"this pizza has a good amount of sauce, and it is very flavorful, giving it a homemade feeling. the crust is delicious, too. we mostly order the pizza and cheese bread. i'm not crazy about this style of garlic bread they make, as it hardens quickly, but their cheese bread is phenomenal and somehow tastes even better as leftovers."
93,5,Positive,"went in on memorial day, no complaints! quick service, good selection. right next to it is a brewery with beer & wine selections that you can eat at too. i had the pizza special (ratatouilli sp?) & added a fried egg !"
94,4,Positive,"i really enjoyed this restaurant. in fact, i went there twice during my stay. mostly for the pizza. i had a fig and artichoke pizza, and added chicken. it was so dang tasty! it was not overly sweet, as you might imagine. it had a perfect blend of tastes. i crave it all the time. the specialty cocktails were very expensive for drinks. my friends had a mango mohito, and said that they were awesome. the service was good. the atmosphere is great. it was very busy at all, which i couldn't understand, but it was overall a great experience. highly recommended for a reasonably priced, nice meal (reasonably prices for vegas, that is)."
95,5,Positive,"first time tonight. staff super friendly, service great, and pizza was fantastic!  we've found a new hangout!  can't wait to try something else for dinner."
96,4,Positive,"from time to time, my family enjoys a good pizza.  however, the gluten free options are very limited for my youngest son and myself.  we have ordered from dominos, which is really gross.

streets of new york was introduced to us about a year ago.  we have been back several times when we want to have a pizza treat.  we love the food.  

the only issue we have is the wait is often very long for our food and the wait staff seems is always a little on the blah side.  a smile, every once in awhile would be nice.  

we will continue to come back, but i would recommend the wait staff perk up a bit, often you look like you (all) hate being there."
97,5,Positive,"we ordered takeout tonight and absolutely loved it.  we had a couple of deep dish pizzas, a gluten free pizza, a salad, some wings, and the cheese curds.  everything was delicious!  also, the service picking up the food was excellent.  everyone was very friendly and the food was ready on time."
98,4,Positive,"by the slice is one of the best pizza places i been to.  it is a small place nicely tucked away in the plaza.  i order here at least once a month for lunch with my co-workers.  they always have killer deals such as 2 medium speciality pizza for $16.99 - their specialy pizzas are amazing as they have around 5-6 toppings on it. southwest chicken and meat combo are my fave.  if you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  ex-large margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $9.99.  they surpising also have amazing fried chicken almost like kfc.  i actually like it more than kfc and it is cheaper as well.  10 huge chicken pieces and medium wedges for only $12.99.  only thing bad is the plaza parking is horrible as it shared with wendy's, starbucks,kelsey and mr. greek.  can't wait to order from them this friday."
99,5,Positive,"i absolutely love this place. i moved to the peoria area about 7 months now and i was trying to find that one really good local pizza joint and i finally found it a few months ago! this place has such a unique place, you can have the exact pizza you love and as fresh as possible because it's baked in your own oven. they use fresh ingredients, awesome sauce and it's pretty affordable ply they have this stamp card so after so many purchases you can get a free family size! i highly recommend this place for any family looking for some good fresh pizza that won't break the bank in the process"
100,4,Positive,"it's pretty difficult to find good pizza in las vegas. it's even more difficult to please 2 east coast people that know their pizza. so when my husband and i say that this is good stuff, we really mean it. 

we love the to-go window where you can order by the slice and even an entire pie. let's be honest, it's the perfect stop after a night of drinking."
101,5,Positive,"yuummmmm!!! we went here to eat after the high roller and got the garlic cheese bread appetizer and classic pepperoni pizza...our first time there, all the food was amazing!  we sat on the patio and when it started raining the waiters came over immediately and helped us move everything to a covered table.  definitely going there for pizza next time we make a vegas trip."
102,5,Positive,"i really enjoyed this place on my recent visit to the aria casino. it's located near the sports book, which was a plus for me.  the pizza was great and they had a nice selection of local craft beer, which was nice since i was visiting from out of town.

5 stars all the way!"
103,5,Positive,"we live in the neighbourhood and decided to go for an early dinner with our two young daughters.  we arrived at around 5:30 on a saturday and there was plenty of space - the tables were filling up when we were leaving though.  i love, love, love that it is very kid friendly while still having amazing grown up food.   they have a kids menu, crayons and a little play area in the corner with some toys and a chalkboard wall.  my girls both had the kids salami pizza and my only complaint would be that the salami was too spicy - we picked it off and they ate their cheese pizza happily.  my husband and i both had pizzas and they were very good - thin crispy crust and large portions.   our waiter was very friendly and the food arrived hot and quickly.  we will definitely be back - maybe for a date night without the kids next time."
104,5,Positive,amazing pizza for $10 and half price apps between 4-6 weekdays. can't recommend this place enough. all pizza recipes that we've tried are perfectly balanced and full of high quality ingredients.
105,5,Positive,"we found this place by doing a search on yelp.  we ordered a sal's special pizza and an order of bread with cheese.  the food and service was great.  the price was great for what we received.  we will be back when we are in the area.  

this place has a lot going for it.  the atmosphere inside is nice and it is like stepping away from the busy area just outside its doors.  it was clean and comfortable and very relaxing.  the service was great and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu."
106,4,Positive,"flour & barley is located on the linq promenade.  this place has really good wood fire pizzas.  you can buy the pizza by the slice at the stand right next to the restaurant.  if you want to try their specialty pizzas, you will have to order from the restaurant.

 each pizza is about 11 inches, and the crust is really thin.  i recommend people to get their own pizzas instead of sharing.  i got to try the mushroom pizza and it was one of my favorites.  there was a decent amount of mushrooms.  i also tried the big apple pizza, which is just spicy pepperoni.  this was also tasty.

overall, great place to get pizzas.  the staff is very nice and friendly to their customers.  i would definitely come back!"
107,4,Positive,i love the idea and execution of custom made pizzas.  the pizza was delicious and it was ready in less than 5 minutes.  i am a fan of this place and will be back.  the place is cool and happy.
108,5,Positive,we love their margarita pizza!  their delivery service is always fast and their food is amazing.  highly recommend!
109,5,Positive,"decided to eat here again because i was craving the cheesy deliciousness and received a coupon in the mail for $10 off a $30 order. 

placed a to-go order. the pizza was ready by the time i got there and was a great price with the coupon. the pizza is amazing! i can't stop eating it. because of the thickness of the pizza, you can eat two slices and be full. recommend sharing a large with 3 other people or saving it for leftovers. i think it tastes even better the next day after being warmed up in the microwave."
110,4,Positive,"i've had bad experiences at other pizza hut shops, but this one always gives me well made pizzas. pizza is always fresh, never burnt, always done by the time i get there. there's always people in there so i'm assuming they feel the same way. try the stuffed crust and crust toppers."
111,5,Positive,this hip pizza and beer spot has a live dj at the bar.  pizzas are light and delicious. staff is fantastic.  be sure to ask for the free hot peppers olive oil mix...mmm!  place was so great we went here twice on our 4-day vacation to montreal.
112,5,Positive,"so all the round table pizza chains in vegas shut their doors and removed their signs... damn shame if you ask me as i was born and raised in the bay and round table has always been my favorite franchise of pizza. damn. so after driving to their location on sahara and ft apache with a craving for pizza just to find it closed i suggested hitting up custom built as it's been on my to do list for quite some time and we were set on pizza.

true to all their reviews and advertisement you pretty much build your own pizza from their selection of crusts and toppings. 

i've been here twice back to back. first time i got a half and half of buffalo chicken and bbq chicken with a few add toppings and they turned out great.

second time i tried to 'layer' the flavors by asking them to make rings of sauce on the crust before cheese and toppings are added. the result wasnt as i was expecting and i realized they dont put a lot of sauce because it makes the pie soggy.

i expect to be coming here frequently to try out the different combinations of pies."
113,4,Positive,"great newyork style pizza, crust and dough is really good. lunch with the slice and salad and drink is so bomb for like 4 bucks, maybe the cheapest lunch in town and it good, not just something you eat cause its cheap, you will want to go back again! wings are good and so are the fried mushroom and zucchini sticks."
114,4,Positive,"the pizza here is pretty standard, nothing special but decent. i am a huge fan of the hot cookies though. that is what this review is for. i don't usually come to oregano's unless i know i am getting a hot cookie for dessert. my favorite is the chocolate chip which comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. best to share with a friend is it is rather large."
115,4,Positive,"one of the best pizza places in old montreal. this place is packed during the weekend, so don't forget to make reservations in advance. the ambiance here is trendy. a fancy cast iron chandelier hangin, 80's music playing in the background, what's not to like about this place.  we ordered the arancino, antipasti, meatballs and pizza's. the arancino's are delish. deep fried risotto balls crispy on the top and soft inside, topped with meat sauce.   antipasti was ok. meatballs were delicious too. now for the pizza's........not one of  the best pizza's i've had, but they were good. we tried the bosco in bianco, capriciosa & cotto e bocconcini.  the crust is flavorful. woodfire makes these pizza's delicious, though i prefer the crust to be a bit extra burnt.  the capriciosa was interesting as i'd never had a boiled egg on the pizza. it actually tastes really good. also ask for the spicy oil. that adds a lot of flavor to it.
definitely worth a visit ...... again & again...... at least for the arancino's  


food -  good
service - friendly
ambiance - trendy
worth the money - aw yissss"
116,5,Positive,don't want to say too many things positive as i don't want it to get too crowded.  great pizza and salads. very neighborly! highly recommend.
117,5,Positive,"if you have never been here, they will bring you a free sample of their wings. great salad and great service. highly recommend the eggplant pizza. the dough is made fresh! the salad pizza looks good, although i haven't tried it."
118,4,Positive,"it's not the best pizza ever, not the best in the strip. for the best pizza i would probably go to grimaldi's at the venetian. but this is good, quality pizza. tasteful and quite convenient if you are at the aria. 

for a quick bite, it gets the job done. you won't be disappointed, especially if you are already inside the aria. the slices are large and you can get your pizza and pay in about two minutes."
119,4,Positive,"good service, and $5 for a large ny style slice of pizza and beer is a pretty damn good deal.  note: that happy hour deal is only for 2 or 3 of the beers on draft."
120,4,Positive,"really a fun place.  great atmosphere, attentive and friendly servers and very good pizza and wings.

the only reason i would not give it a 5 star rating was that they were out of three of the beers i really wanted to try.

definitely still a place i highly recommend."
121,5,Positive,"great pizza!! this place was a great last minute pick!! 
we decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! the service was great!! we had a friendly and patient server with our undecided group. also we loved the surprisingly good tasting white sauce on our pizzas!! everything was amazing!! the mozzarella appetizers and the extreme hot wings!! oh so good, fatty food!! we look forward to coming back!!"
122,5,Positive,"yummmmm! 
the atmosphere is so comfortable, i especially love the patio area where we like to enjoy a glass of wine and a couple of appetizers. the food is excellent especially the pizza and i think its hard to find good pizza!! this is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family......we do both :)
great food at an excellent value with wonderful service! what more could you possibly want."
123,5,Positive,"finally made a visit to lucille this past weekend and i can't wait to go back!  i'd heard mixed reviews on the pizza but honestly that's crazy!  that being said everything pales in comparison to their nachos...seriously...they are the best nachos i've ever had!  their drinks are out of this world (which was expected since they're a merchant step-sister) and the lounge in the basement is a must for after dinner socializing (tip: order the mexican firing squad)!  way to go lucille, yet another killer restaurant added to madison!"
124,5,Positive,"bartender, jerry, took great care of me. he recommended the date/jalapeño pizza. incredible! highly recommended!!"
125,4,Positive,"the happy hour gang i hang out with frequents this place often.  it's hard to find a decent martini in cleveland, but i have to say they know how to shake an excellent one here.

i've been here a few times and the food has been consistently delicious every time.  the pizzas really stand out.  they're half price during happy hour.  oh and they're also a little smaller than the full priced fare, but they are still delicious.

the rest of the menu looks really delicious, but i don't know how many people know they have a full menu.  people may think this is a bar only, yet there appear to be some really nice entrees as well.  i'll need to come back and try those.

during warmer weather, this is one of the best patios around.  i really want this place to succeed.  this location has been cursed by so many failed restaurants.  in my opinion, this place should be around for a long time.  it's nice to have a classier, unpretentious wine and martini bar on the west side of town."
126,5,Positive,"i absolutely love their pizza and drive out of my way to get it, closest thing i have found to real new york style pizza. i would highly recommend the sausage."
127,5,Positive,"awesome, well-priced pizza. tasty, cheap snacks (arancini). beautiful space - the decor is phenomenal for a counter-service place. much higher-end all around (quality of food, quality of ambience) than you'd expect for the price point - even the napkins were high-class! a phenomenal addition to downtown. go there immediately!"
128,5,Positive,"about ten years ago i searched for a pizza place that taste like the ones we have in michigan. and, we have our share of great pizza shops in the mid west. i was told about beach pizza, went there, and have never been disappointed with their pizza. it is my ""special treat"" when i need one. they are fast, friendly, and the price doesn't make you feel like you are back in california. beach, i love your pizza."
129,5,Positive,we love the theme of oregano's. super cozy to come here on a date. we ordered parmesan chicken with caesar salad and enjoyed it so much! would totally recommend this place to anyone! we've come here on multiple events with big groups and just me and my husband at times and the customer service here never let us down. super friendly waiters and great food and will never go bad. also they have really good thin crust pizza
130,4,Positive,"when i saw this place show up as a hot new business on the yelp frontpage, i thought it was a bit of a silly name.  but it tells you everything you need to know about the business.  think subway/chipotle (custom built sandwich/burrito) assembly line style ordering, but for pizza.  $8.95 gets you a 12-inch pizza with all the toppings you want.  according to their website:

(4) kinds of sauces
(4) kinds of cheeses, which you can combine together
(7) kinds of meats
(7) kinds of veggies
(7) kinds of toppers, added after the pizza is cooked

who else sells you a (potentially) 25-topping pizza for $8.95?!  i don't know if i would try it.  except that i totally would if i could order it without feeling like a bit of a jerk.  once you order your pie, you'll have it within minutes; these cook fast.  10 minutes after setting foot into the restaurant i had my food!

for my very first custom built pizza i had the spicy diavola sauce, fresh mozzarella, italian sausage, mushroom, garlic and sun dried tomatoes (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ceqwpwhboaxwrcv5btnv6g?select=zg2bak39zop7m6bmzmaf7q#tqe5lahn7spzzw2mlvafag).  i can still taste the spicy diavola and garlic in my breath, and i'm quite okay with that.  no gum for me, i'm still enjoying my pizza.  tasty ingredients all around, and the crust keeps a chewy consistency with a slight crunch.  

you want to ask me out for dinner?  how the heck are you gonna do that?  you can build me a pizza or something.  i am a fan and i will most definitely be back."
131,4,Positive,"while shopping in the strip, we wanted to grab a quick bite for a late lunch. we stopped in and i got two slices of pepperoni pizza. the slices were enormous, covered in pepperoni and piping hot. i'm normally more of a thick crust fan, but the crispy thin crust here was on point. i scarfed down my two slices, which were probably more like four slices of normal sized pizza, and headed back out the door. 

will definitely be back for another slice, or three."
132,4,Positive,"i've been coming to this sauce for quite a while and its consistently good. i don't think i've ever had a bad experience because i always know what to expect.

the pizza is good, salads are solid, and the mac n' cheese...well, lets just say i'm a sucker it. every time we come to eat here the service is friendly and helpful, probably the best i've had from a ""fast casual"" type of restaurant.

i definitely recommend sauce if you're looking for something fairly quick but delivers on quality."
133,4,Positive,"i enjoy pizza hut but i personally dont like the oversized chicken and i know its not them but all i ordered was chicken but the kids loved the pizza and the mild chicken. they were 5,7, & 2."
134,4,Positive,came in during lunch. pretty busy inside but nice atmosphere has a really nice patio seating area. got the garlic knots as an appetizer very good! got the margarita pizza with sausage on it super yummy!
135,5,Positive,"honestly this was so good. i have eaten there twice in one week. the pizza was amazing and then we went back for pasta. seriously the service was wonderful and the food yum. but the price was the best part. we had wine, appetizers, salad and full entrees and the bill was ....wait for it....$48 bucks. whoohoo."
136,5,Positive,"awesome place. visited from california... wish we had something like this place here. got the fontina burger one day and the bbq chicken pizza the next. the ""grilled"" pizza has an awesome charred taste.

wish i could have tried the apple fritters but i walked up to the counter at 11:01 and they had stopped serving breakfast. they should really serve those all day long."
137,4,Positive,"when you have three kids under 10 and a 4 month old (aunt duty), cooking dinner is the last thing on your mind. at least for the inexperienced over here lol. 

i wanted to try something new, so i found the closest ny pizza place to my house. ordered two large pizzas with garlic balls (12) and was happy with the order. the pizza was made perfect. my only complaint is that i had to wait even when i arrived over thirty minutes past the time given for the food to be ready."
138,4,Positive,"had their pizza, that was awesome.  it was one loaded up with stuff that i can't remember, but it was fab.

went back tonight and was a tad disappointed in what came with the gyro platter.  some good places that i've been to put a little medley of things, which it had but was just olives, and those green things that end in cini.  there's a place in seattle that i have yet to find which compares.  these guys put rice, hummus, feta, olives, tzatziki, and a small greek salad on the side which you can make an awesome wrap with!  and there was more portion for the same price. the meat was good, and everything was good, but i won't order that again.  seattle's ruined me.  if you are ever in seattle, you must go to mr. gyro's.  i will confidently say that you will not find anyone who makes them better, if so, you got damn lucky!"
139,5,Positive,"i am a big big fan of a good piece of pizza...this is some real good pizza. good sauce, awesome crust. laid back atmosphere to the restaurant. good service. overall i am very pleased with this restaurant."
140,5,Positive,"kicker's pizza is a brook park treasure!! the wings are amazing and the chicken philly is quite possibly the perfect sandwich. the homemade blue cheese should be sold in stores, too. the pizza is made from scratch - no frozen crusts or canned sauce. it's the real deal. try the wing pizza or the blt pizza for something unique."
141,4,Positive,"this pizza was very flavorful!  we got an all meat one and we were not disappointed.  
we got back to our room at excalibur at around 11:45 after seeing britney spears.  we were starving and decided to call this place.  it was delivered in 45 minutes.  not bad.  it tasted home-made, and the delivery man was a nice man.  
i lived everything about our experience, except for the fact that the woman on the phone who took my order was short in her words, giving me a bit of attitude.  that's the only reason i am not giving a 5-star rating."
142,5,Positive,"great pizza, hands down awesome crust and toppings. we had the forager and the balance between mushrooms meatiness and spinach earthiness was spot on. good service and modest price makes this is a winner choice. arugula and delicate squash salad was very unique and not too sweet in spite of the cranberry purée and citrus dressing. give it a try if you are in the mood to try something different."
143,5,Positive,"got a flyer on our door so we thought we'd give them a try... glad we did! we took advantage of their ""anytime party special"" of 2 pizzas, garlic balls and a soda. excellent crust- hand tossed but not too thick and chewy. great texture and flavor! garlic balls were also good- i like a little more garlic flavor, but they were definitely good! we will explore other items they offer in the future!"
144,4,Positive,"i live in cleveland but this store is close to cleveland so they deliver in my area. good pizza, a wide variety on the menu and the price point is spot on. the pizza crust is fresh and the ingredients are fresh as well. i have had the chicken wrap several times and it is huge and enough for two meals. it is fresh chicken and has a great flavor. one time the wrapper was on the dry side though. so next time i order i will mention that . i have had the chicken tenders and they were good as well. they offer a variety of sandwiches hot and cold, chicken wings, pasta dinners, desserts and of course pizza. the shrimp alfredo dinner was very good and had a nice flavor. the sauce was not on the thick side.  i had the pasta dinner with sausage and mushrooms and it was very very good. i have had the cheesecakes there and they are not home made but ok when you have a sweet tooth.  the deliveries are very quick. i went to the actual store and it was clean and i watched them prepare the food and they used gloves. they are always friendly and polite. the store is located off lorain road closer to the fairview bridge and kamn's corner area.  there is plenty of parking and you can bike there if you want."
145,5,Positive,bruno was recommended to us by a good friend and they did not stear us wrong.  one of the best pizzas we have had in a long time.   the sauce was so good and the staff was great.  on little surprise was the cesar salad. the owner shared that they make all their own dressings so we had to give it a try spook good. give bruno a try and the only problem you'll have is trying to figure out when to return to try something different.
146,4,Positive,"it's been awhile since my first visit to charbar when it first opened and although i didn't have the best experience that time around, i must say that i've truly enjoyed my last three visits here! all of them have been for their brunch or lunch service. i've been able to try the deep fried french toast bites, bagna cauda, asado plate, jamon crudo pizza, and during big taste their feature breakfast burger.

today i ordered one of the lunch features which was a pizza that featured roasted chicken and crispy chicken skin on top! like what, who does that?! the crispy chicken skin is what sold me and i definitely thought it finished off the pizza so well. their pizza dough by the way is bomb because it comes from sidewalk citizen =) our server today was lovely (i wish i remembered his name, i am the worst at that!) he was very personable and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal. and just a small thing that i noticed was that more than one person (that didn't include our server) ensured that we always had water in our glass. i appreciate that attentiveness because it really shows that they work as a team.

p.s. their beef fat fries are amazeballs! they are the type of fries that you can't stop eating no matter how full you are.

reserving my last star for when i am able to go back and try their dinner menu again, but if my last few visits indicate anything, i'm sure it won't be hard to give =)"
147,4,Positive,"in the past, there were spans when i would order pizza way too often. lately, i've been eating a lot healthier...though, i'm not made of stone.

of the delivery pizza places, i like pizza hut the most. their on-line ordering feature is extremely intuitive, allowing you to visually customize your exact order.

this particular location just so happens to be the one assigned to deliver to my location. in the short time i've lived here, i've always had pleasant experiences with the delivery people. they always seem to be happy, and are decently engaged. also, they always seem to arrive early or on-time...which is kind of important.

all in all, the via linda pizza hut is a reliable choice for a decent pizza in my opinion.

if you're looking for a tasty break from the normal pizza, try a thin crust chicken + jalapeno...but be warned...i think pizza hut harvests some of these peppers from the center of the sun. not all of them...but there are a few that make you sniffle something fierce."
148,5,Positive,with having three kids in the house we differently eat a lot of pizza. by far the best pizza i have had in the area. we moved in a couple blocks away and this will for sure be a walking distance dinner spot for us. oh and the wings amazing. first place i have asked for extra crispy and they understood what i meant!!! loved it! and the fact that its family owned and they are super nice just made it even better.
149,5,Positive,"a place that delivers in gilbert? yes, yes, yes!!! i wasn't certain while using the app for delivery whether it was accurate or not. i've spent the past 9 months in gilbert with very limited delivery options. when i say limited, i mean, there's been but a couple pizza joints to order from.

i'm not really a pizza enthusiast so, i've starved many late nights for this reason. 

i always check just to see if there have been changes. well, two places apparently deliver. in my disbelief, first thing i did was call to check since they appeared to be a little ways away. the gentleman was very kind on the phone in confirming they'd come out to us. i used the app to place my order because i feel it's much easier that way. therefore i was basing it off of the menu on here. i ordered samosas for the kid, a combo beef shrimp kabob platter for the man, a side of kabuli style rice and the vegetable qorma. i was so excited! within minutes i received a call from the restaurant to inform me they no longer served the vegetable qorma, and so went with the spinach qorma instead.

honestly, the call alone was a very noble move on their end. not to mention, i just checked to see what it was that i ordered and it appears that the menu has already been updated on the yelp app so, kudos for that as well!

although the wait time was closer to the 75 minute mark, the order arrived still hot and correct. 

that rice? so so so so so good! i didn't try much of anyone else's dishes and can't speak to much more other than they looked appealing and no one complained. the 7 year old didn't even make a stink about this foreign item that she devoured. i may have skipped the extra side had i realized my dish came with some but i had it today, four days later, for lunch and it was still off the chain. 

we will definitely order from here again and i will definitely tell all of the neighbors about the place!"
150,4,Positive,this might be the best pizza i have ever eaten. new york style thin crust with high quality ingredients on top. they have thick crust selections as well. new york theme and decor. very friendly and good service. the place is packed in the evening even on weekdays. superb price/value on food and drinks. located across 215 about 20 minutes from the strip in the suburbs of las vegas. if you go by cab be prepared to wait a long time for one to pick you up.  there are not many destinations for cab drivers in this part of vegas so they do not like driving one way without a fare to pick you up.
151,5,Positive,"this pizza is absolutely delicious. we are in town for a work/pleasure trip and  went based on other yelp recommendations and were not dissappointed. their red pizza was a perfect blend of crust, sauce and cheeses. very tasty. we also ordered a white pie with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms ( i don't know that they were canned, but they seemed to be precooked) and sweet white onions.  the crust was smeared with a sort of garlic oil spread, then the toppings and finished with a blend of cheeses. it arrived perfectly cooked and piping hot from the oven.  there are a few booths in the back with a sort of help yourself drink set-up. the staff could not have been any friendlier. this will be our go to pizza place the next time we are in pittsburgh!"
152,4,Positive,"i would like to give danny boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that i've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. i really haven't found a pizza i can devote myself to in this area. 

the garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. we really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in. very tasty pepperoni and parmesan recipe. 

the regular crust pizza we ordered for carry out next time was pretty good too, but not as good as the thin.

some of the specialty pizzas really looked good. can't wait to try them. 

it's not coccia house, but what is."
153,4,Positive,we came for sunday lunch. no one here but thats fine with us. service was great. ordered pizza and 8pc chicken combo. 4 of us enjoyed and had leftovers for the week. food is amazing. best chicken ever. kfc who?
154,5,Positive,"this is our favorite pizza place in las vegas for more than 10 years now. we just keep coming back!may it be for lunch, dinner or party! yummy pizza, fries, gyros, phily cheesesteak and many more! my kids love their meat lovers and chicken alfredo pizza. ben, the owner is awesome too!  may it be dine in, pick up, take out or delivery... you wont be disappointed!"
155,4,Positive,"this is one of the better lunch spots in scottsdale. any salad and any pizza for a flat price (i think $9). very reasonable. great atmosphere, easy parking, fast service. so many salad and pizza options you will never get bored."
156,4,Positive,"good hot dog, great fries and the best pizza puff in the state! we just ordered a few things but will be back for more."
157,4,Positive,just finished lunch.  the atmosphere was very pleasant.  the food was really good.  i had a custom pizza and feel that it was reasonably priced.  the service was fine and the food came out in a timely fashion.  i was somewhat reticent to go after reading the pther yelp reviews but experienced none of the conditions depicted in previous reviews.  the fact that they all menyioned yhe same vompetitor makes me wonder if there aren't some shenanigans going on.  my advice is to try it if you like brick oven thin crust pizza.  you won't be disappointed.
158,5,Positive,4.5/5! definitely one of toronto's best kept secrets when it comes to thin crust pizza! recommend the antipasti minto to start and the famous bufalina pizza (large enough to share depending on appetite)!
159,4,Positive,"cool place.  took my wife and son to the recline and dine (movies.) overall, pretty cool spot to check a flick.  prices are decent, the place is clean, and comfortable.  i like the idea of reclining on a chair.  seats recline and food is served here.  based on previous reviews i was afraid to order food from their pizza place so i have no opinion on the food.  the movie experience was great though."
160,5,Positive,"i can't say enough good things about piola. i moved into the building late last year and have probably visited the restaurant, or had take out, close to 10 times already. eating in the staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. taking out they are always fast.

must endorse the san danielle pizza - fresh mozzarella with parma ham, mmmm and do not forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. the diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. the crust here is right up there with terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower.

would also endorse the spaghetti and meatballs, so so tender the meatballs fall apart with a fork and the pasta is perfectly cooked with fresh curls of parmesan all over the top. 

look for the great daily specials - wednesdays is half price bottles of wine! so awesome. i believe kids eat free on sundays too."
161,4,Positive,"discovered tryst (organic) cafe shortly after it opened about 2+ yrs ago. have had breakfast, lunch & dinner there. they have organic everything - food, beer, wine, even vodka - which is what drew me at first. also many gluten free choices.

they've had their ups & downs with service, but it's usually good. the happy hour is limited and should be improved in both hours & choices.

my wife & i both love their seered ahi tuna salad, it's fantastic! we both want and need a good organic cafe in the area and hate to see the pizza place next door packed while the healthy restaurant is lightly filled. help tryst thrive!"
162,5,Positive,great food and fast delivery. highly recommend the chicken cesar pizza. yum yum yum!!
163,4,Positive,"ordered sushi pizza and extra salmon sushi combo.  food came quickly and the quality of the salmon in the sashimi was very good.   food quality was good, portions reasonable, and prices are reasonable.  good place to come for a quick meal."
164,4,Positive,"stopped in on a sunday afternoon and i could not resist a slice of pizza and a beer for $5. it turned out to be a good choice. i liked the pizza. it has a crispy crust and they really load up the toppings. it's also a very large slice of pizza. i was pleasantly full after just one slice. not that it stopped me from ordering a second slice.

we also tried the bruschetta appetizer, which was quite good. the serve a bowl of the mixed up toppings with a generous portion of toasted crostini. my only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. the chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. not a big deal, really.

i'll be back."
165,5,Positive,"my boyfriend and i heard about this place from a friend so we decided to try it out. food and service was awesome! we had tyler as our server; he was super nice and just the right amount of attentive. he also was really knowledgable about their beer list as well as the menu.

we ordered a lot more food then we could have finished, but it was all amazing. the chicken wings with fries as delicious (i'd take a giant bowl of the fries alone because they were addictive), garlic buns (easily a meal in itself) that were actually garlicky, and we got the smallest size ""back home"" pizza (i think that's what it was called) which we took half home for leftovers.

definitely recommend naked city tavern. it's nice to have a place to just relax with good beers and good food locally."
166,5,Positive,"what a wonderful find! delicious, inventive, hand-crafted food, together with warm & welcoming service in a fun downtown locale. we enjoyed everything we tried, and since there were four of us and we did everything family style, we tried a lot! highlights included the beets & gnudi, the mushroom polenta, the cacio e pepe, the butternut squash agnotti, and the butterscotch dessert. the bacon/onion/egg pizza and crispy pancetta cavatelli were also great. thanks to eric for superb service and to james, the chef, for creating a truly terrific restaurant and coming out to chat with us. we'll be back again and again."
167,4,Positive,"the pizza was good but a little cold, delivery took longer than expected, but all in all the pizza was good. i will highly recommend if you are a fan of good pizza."
168,5,Positive,"great restaurant! great service and great pizzas! consistently good service and excellent food. great beers on tap. friendly staff and decent prices.
will continue to go back!!"
169,5,Positive,"guy's pizza co. coventry location has an average of 2.5 stars, say what?! i can't believe these 1 and 2 star reviews!? i have always experienced friendly and fast service at this guy's pizza location. although i have to admit the only time i go here is before i go to a show at the grog shop. i'd have to say i like the nyc small pizza joint vibe. the place is always filled with hs kids hanging out, laughing, and eating. 

it has been my tradition ever since guys opened on coventry rd and the grog moved to its south coventry rd location - that before a show i get a slice of pizza and a can of tahitian treat for only $2.75!

on this particular evening before the chelsea peretti - america treasure tour show. i went in for my ritual slice & can of tt. and there was no more tt!!! i was sadden by the lack of product and the counter girl shared my disappointment. i reluctantly ordered a sprite. as i left the manager came in with a whole bunch of tahitian treats -and the counter girl gave me one on the house!! granted it's only $0.75 but, it was the thought that counted and for that i give them 5 stars!!!!

by the looks of the other reviews they don't do delivery or big orders well. so, i say if you want a quick bite while shopping, walking around coventry, or before a show this the place to go!"
170,5,Positive,this is the best pizza & pasta dishes at the lake by far. this place is the real deal starting with the new york atmosphere &  making you feel at home from the start. great food at at very modest price. you will have food left over to take home. the meatballs & sauces are  delicious & all the breads / desserts are made daily  right there. italian food at its finest...
171,4,Positive,"i was craving pizza on friday and decided to stop by. i normally order takeout and have ordered from this place three times previously. my go to is a medium pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and tomato but this time i decided to try out the pizza and wings combo. fridays are busy and my wait time was 45mins. previous visits were a 15min wait. 

a steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their order and they all greeted the owner by name so i guess they are regulars. another thing i noticed was that a customer that came in and ordered 15mins after me received her order before me so i don't know if she received special treatment because she's a regular or that my pizza just took longer to cook lol. 

the pizza here have always been perfectly cooked and the crust crispy and this time it was no different. the wings on the other hand were disappointing and lacking. they were on the smaller end and for a couple dollars more, i would rather get wings at all stars.  

whenever i have a pizza craving, i'll come back."
172,5,Positive,"great food, great vibe. had cheese pizza, risotto with spinach, chilis, and sweet potato, and amazing sangria. we went during the day, and the vibe was very laid back and comfortable for all (my husband and i went with our 2 and 6 yr old, and met up with other family members, adults and kids, and we all had a blast). walked by later that night and clearly this is the place to be. will be returning as soon as i come back to town."
173,5,Positive,california dreamin pizza and meatball calzone were fresh and perfectly baked.  loved the fried dough with powdered and cinnamon sugar.  service was wonderful.  both the girls working were polite and helpful.
174,4,Positive,"good thin crust pizza. we had the dough knots as an appetizer, the 10-inch popeye pie for dinner and took home a slice of the italian creme cake. can't complain -- all was tasty. best part? the price. the cake was somewhat of a splurge ($6.50, but the slice is huge) - otherwise, it would have been a $12 dinner for two. 

we'll be back to try more pizzas.

we were there early for dinner on a wednesday and it was not crowded (not shocking...). our order was taken at a table, though several people came in to order to-go and went straight to the counter."
175,5,Positive,i was amazed by how well the pizza tasted ! my favourite was the goat cheese with sundried tomato & mint. a unique combination which was delicious. the owner was friendly with great customer service.  a definitely a must go to!!!
176,4,Positive,"this place is my go-to pizza delivery joint. ordering via grubhub, my delivery is consistently on time, accurate, and hot. in the many times i've ordered from little nippers i have never had a bad order.
their pizza is pretty tasty for pittsburgh standards. hoagies are on point!
their prices are really reasonable--they're a great go-to when ordering out!"
177,5,Positive,"the best chicago style pizza in town! being from the east coast, that should say a lot"
178,5,Positive,we are delivery junkies for this place.  i think the large cheese pizza is amazing and we crave it all the time!  i am a huge metro fan but this place is cheaper and has a lot of heart.  the food is so hot when it gets here i always burn my mouth.  all the other food i have tried is good but the pizza is the real star.  a rare gem in this city!!
179,5,Positive,it's a great neighbor place. the pizza is great. the salads are airways fresh and the chicken fingers are delicious! always friendly and fast service.
180,4,Positive,"good prices. 
good ny pizza. 
fast. 
good selection of slices with cool toppings. 
easy to stop in if you're walking on fremont. 

bottom line: don't drive across town for this one, but it's a good stop if you're on foot in the area."
181,4,Positive,"the thin crust pizza here is the best i've had in the valley. the thick or deep dish is just okay it doesn't really do it for me to say the least. but boy are the flavors there when you order the thin crust.  we always used to come here on tuesdays to get the tuesday take out special which apparently stopped. when we called today to go get the usual tuesday deal to us the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no. so now that they have taken away my tuesday special i can tell you at this moment that the chances of us going to nellos after this are slim to none.

i'm severely disappointed that they have no specials anymore but nothing lasts forever i guess. i will miss you nellos very much i will but i guess we will be sticking closer to home and trying out pizza on 87....sigh.... :("
182,4,Positive,"the 10"" margherta pizza smelled fresh and yummy and the 4pc chicken mix was also very tasty, but the chicken was a pinch salty but still juicy. the garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good. some of the garlic bread was bit tough but still has a good flavor. the wedges are nicely flavored and crispy. was a bit pricey but sort of worth it. overall i give it a 8 1/2 out of 10."
183,5,Positive,"the best pizza that i have found so far in las vegas!  the stromboli's are good, tha anti pasta is great, etc.  love this small walk up with a few tables for sitting.  the best part though (as it should be) is the pizza!"
184,5,Positive,"amazing savory pies!!!  the green chili gringo hand pie is ridiculous.  perfect flakey crust, just the right amount of filling of pork green chili, eggs, potatoes and cheddar- great on the go breakfast!  i also tried the 5"" pork green chili pot pie, which of course was wonderful.  we need one more pizza and/or desert shop across the street and we can officially call this stretch of coronado bordering 7th street: the pie district."
185,4,Positive,"excellent pizza -- the best delivery i've had. tasty and not too greasy. 

love the restaurant's emphasis on sustainability -- they use local ingredients and have a lot of environmentally sustainable business practices. 

fantastic pizza and socially conscious -- we just found our new go-to pizza place."
186,4,Positive,"it may be little....but this market has punch!

a cupcake truck (salted caramel cupcake, mmm), pizza oven truck, crepe truck....spices, fresh fruits and veggies, the world's most fragrant popcorn, cheese, plenty of meat options (bison bratwurst?!)....i have to say my expectations have been exceeded. 

add in the fact that a number of great restaurants/ bars/ coffee shops are within walking distance, and just found yourself a lovely tuesday afternoon."
187,4,Positive,"great location .  very nice inside as well as outside.
the pizzas and pasta were superb.
great service and nice atmosphere."
188,4,Positive,"just left and it was my second visit. i really love everything i've ordered so far! the butter pecan shake is to die for. you get pecans in every sip, it's amazing. i am not a soda drinker at all but i love the tractor soda and i wish there was somewhere i could purchase it! the only thing i didn't like today was how long everything took. it already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food. our food also came out all separate. we got our milkshake first, 10 minutes later my bf got his burger and 15
minutes later i got my pizza."
189,5,Positive,"lovely little place off the beaten path, yet walking distance from everything. cozy ambiance both inside and on the patio. the prosciutto and mushroom pizza was delicious-thin and crispy crust cooked perfectly, not burned. i would definitely eat here again on my next visit to toronto!"
190,5,Positive,"we planned a casual wedding rehearsal dinner at streets of new york, near the site of the wedding. we live 600 miles away, so i had to make all plans by phone/email. the restaurant and its manager were great! the tables were set up and we were ready to go as soon as the wedding party arrived. all i did was embellish the tables a bit with some sparkly confetti, and it looked festive and inviting. the presentation was great, and so was the food! we had  crisp, fresh green salads and wonderful breadsticks. we ate a delicious baked ziti pasta, along with a number of outstanding regular-crust pizzas. we loved the mediterranean pizza! we also had the new york, meat-eaters, vegetarian, hawaiian, and a special one with pesto, feta, and sliced tomatoes. each one was great! we ate our fill and had plenty left to save and munch on later. the service was superlative. i highly recommend streets of new york on east germann rd. as a great place to get together with friends to enjoy some terrific food!"
191,5,Positive,"this is based on a take out experience, so please do not expect to dine in there and have me stand by my review :)

we were looking for a new pizza place to try near our house on a lazy sunday.  given that some seem closed on sundays, we decided to look up fazio's as i had in my bookmarks.  although it said it was closed here on yelp (i did send a message with the hours for it to be corrected), we continued to look at the menu that it had a link to.  it said they were open so we called in our order. 

large cheese pizza and 1/2 chicken parm hoagie to go (we did not want to commit to a whole after a few bad experiences elsewhere).  we wish that we ended up getting a whole though, that is for sure.  the pizza was thinner, not too heavy crust wise, there was ample cheese (by ample, i mean a lot), and the sauce was great imo.  the chicken parm hoagie was crispy, not mushy, and absolutely awesome!  everything was awesome... and we will definitely be ordering from there again.  my husband said that they were extremely nice in there too.  

cannot wait to go back!"
192,4,Positive,girlfriend took me here for my birthday. awesome pizza. a little pricey but well worth it.
193,4,Positive,"love it. owners are from west babylon, ny. they had a pizza shop and italian bakery in islip terrace ny right down the street from where i grew up. i could not believe they lived here for so long and i was unaware. garlic knots are great and the pizza is good ny style. the family were all in tonight and visited our table when they heard we were from east islip. uncle joe is such a nice man. the entire evening was just delightful. i am happy to discover this little gem of a place and i will be back. happy to say they opened a beall's outlet right next door too so i can shop and eat. well, at least until they move to their new location."
194,5,Positive,the pizza taste just like pizza in  new york .  it has a thin crust  and they cook it in the brick oven. the sauce is so full of flavor.  it is hard to find good pizza anywhere outside of new york but this is the best i have had so far.. im craving it right know. i usually get the pepperoni or add hot peppers to it..
195,4,Positive,"duck poutine pizza. of course, that is what everyone is talking about. i'm still thinking about it the next day. it's one of those dishes that is perfect for the great white north. the kind of food you need to fatten up before the great hibernation. if bears could, they would order the duck poutine pizza before they slept for the winter. and after a lunch of this pizza i needed a nap. it's definitely worth a trip to bannock to eat this deliciousness especially if you need to bulk up for a long cold winter."
196,5,Positive,"do you know how difficult it is to make a 5-star hawaiian pizza? maybe you don't like hawaiian pizza, maybe you don't care.  but as a lover of hawaiian pizza i can tell you that is very easy to make a 3-star hawaiian pizza and exceedingly difficult to make a 5-star hawaiian pizza.  the one here is it.

the dough was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was delicious. i assume this applies to all of their pizza too. but the pineapples were the perfect size of chunks, plentiful, and did not soak through the dough.  the ham was not thin slices or cold cut ham; but rather thick chunks of cured pork.  add to that a dash of the chilli-olive oil that they bring to the table, and you've basically got the perfect hawaiian pizza.  my dad had a different pizza with chicken and it also looked awesome (he said he loved it though i did not try it).

for dessert i had the tiramisu, and i cannot complain - clearly homemade, terrific balance of sweet and coffee flavouring.

piola is near queen and dufferin, a bit far from the downtown core. i will be back; it is worth the trip!"
197,5,Positive,great pizza at a small price. tonys is one restraunt in boulder city that really has good value with a great product. real pizza here. the slices are awesome also..
198,5,Positive,"well what can i say about rocky's. its one of the few pizza places i like to eat from and im not a real pizza lover.

pizza is nice thin crunchy crust with an amazing sauce.
first time i ate there i ordered a pepporoni slice, and thats where it all started.
after that we ordered a full pizza, my wifey was in pizza heaven (major pizza lover) it was delicious, didnt complain one bit.
tried one of there baked subs and it was tasty too.(meatball sub)

wings were great too, nice and spicy and very good.

only thing is they dont have fountain drinks, they sell soda by the can, tea, gatorade, water and are not open that late.
all n all it was good."
199,5,Positive,"there aren't a lot of places in the montreal region you can get your hands on some great authentic napoletan pizza. this place is a regular for my wife and i.

i won't go into all the details but the pizzas are great. thin crust, focus on the quality of the ingredients. fresh and tasty.

quebecois beware. there aren't handfuls of toppings, the quebecois couple we invited with us once were shocked to have been deprived their usual bucket of toppings that dilutes the taste of a well done wood oven cooked pizza.

the arancini balls are very very good.

their nutella pizza is a favorite of ours too.

service is quick and friendly.

my highlights are when the owner passes by and says hello and i get to converse some of my rusty napoletan. :)"
200,4,Positive,"i got my order to go. my veggie pie was ready when i arrived. the price was very reasonable. the place was clean, had a fresh and trendy appearance, and outside seating if desired.

i came here because they have a vegan pizza that is made with hummus instead of fake cheese! i thought this was so awesome, but you can see from the picture that the hummus is just mainly piled on top in the middle instead of spread uniformly over the pizza as a base. so basically you eat the pizza with veggies on it, and then take a spoon to the center to get the hummus. all of the ingredients tasted good despite the awkward assembly. 

service was bland... not rude...but never smiled. 

regardless, i give this place a thumbs up because it offers real vegan pizza!"
201,5,Positive,"i would give this spot 10 stars if i could. this is as close as it gets to real italian pizza, which i have eaten plenty of in italy. that means, great crust, and no ""american"" tomato sauce, but rather a good fresh, ground, uncooked tomato sauce that gets cooked in the oven. the pepperoni is not like you get in the us. it is sausage resembling more of a home made pepperoni with strong pork flavor. the mozzarella cheese is made fresh and the parmesan is real, no fillers. salads are generous and very tasty with a simple dressing. the owner and staff are very on point to make sure you know what you are getting and do a fantastic job at making you comfortable. the only downside i experienced was that the glass of wine is small. i don't know what their pour is but it is the only thing not generously given. not served in a traditional stemmed glass, it was more like a small 1/2 full glass of fruit juice. but i went for the pizza, not the wine. also, short wait time. the pizza bakes in 90 seconds once it is in the oven. novanta means 90."
202,4,Positive,pizza is pretty good here. came in for a pizza at lunchtime place was pretty dead so didn't wait to long. the beer was ice cold. will come back for sure. if you haven't been here it's worth the trip.
203,5,Positive,"great pizza place. this is the type of restaurant that is typically found downtown pittsburgh. we had the pork wings which had a smokey sweet bbq sauce. they were amazing. the pizza was around 12 inches and was about medium/thin thickness. it is pricey and i highly recommend going during happy hour to save some money. which reminds me, the beer selection was eclectic and i enjoyed some beers that i wasn't familiar with. absolutely recommend coming here."
204,5,Positive,best pizza in the area by far. one of the best i've ever had. the seafood pizza is absolutely amazing. great service and they go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.  so for everyone who said they had an unpleasent experience next time open your mouth and say something or don't complain. unfortunately we know people who have avoided the restaurant because of some of the reviews people have written.  if you don't like the pizza then that's your opinion.  i understand but i eat there quite often and have never had a bad experience . i have never talked to anyone who has either.  for those of you who are wondering no i am not th owner but i am one of his best customers i bet. the only reason i am giving them 5 stars is because it wont let me give them 6. to the management of fat bobs keep up the great work and for god sakes don't change the sea food pizza.
205,5,Positive,"the pizza was really good!
they have interesting combinations but everything is really testing. i've been here 3 night in a row.
i recommend this"
206,5,Positive,"a place with only french fries and ice cream - what a divine idea!  it's easy to find gourmet ice cream parlors, but gourmet french fries are a new treat!  

i recently visited and was immediately struck by the ambience of the inside.  although the restaurant is enclosed, it has high ceilings and a pickup window which helped give it a vibe of being outside, particularly close to a fun beach location.  whether it's the thought of gourmet french fries and ice cream that helped fuel the ""vacation"" vibe, i definitely got a nice break from reality when i walked in.  

i ordered the pizza fries with pepperoni and man were they yummy!  crispy hand-cut fries seasoned with fresh herbs, perfectly melted cheese and topped with baby pepperonis, all with marinara sauce for dipping.  it was amazing!  i don't know why more pizza restaurants don't convert to serving pizza this way, it was a really inspired!  

this place warrants a visit, whether you order or just enjoy the ambience and drool over the menu while you're there.  no matter your tastes, sweet or savory, sweetie fry has something you will enjoy!"
207,4,Positive,my deliverer was fast and nice. this is my go to place when i was some garlic breaded pizza.
208,5,Positive,"loved this place! went for lunch. and had the bianca with sausage. the pizza came out really quickly and was hot. loved that they have not only grated parm and pepper flakes, but also hot oil. i also asked for a side of sauce (my pizza didn't have it on it) and they brought some with no problem. the space is bright and really welcoming, and the people are friendly. will definitely be back!"
209,4,Positive,"the idea behind this place is great. it screams nostalgia for any gamer while providing really good pizza. the pepperoni pizza was delicious. the crust was cooked to perfection and the cheese was gooey and melted. they carry a variety of canned sodas, my personal favorites including grape soda and vanilla dr. pepper! being able to play video games while you wait for your order is what makes this place so unique. each table against the wall has at least one system hooked up varying from nes to the wii u and ps3! overall great place. 4 stars instead of 5 because of location size. it could be so much more if moved to a larger location. but, start small and grow super pizza bros."
210,5,Positive,"excellent food! great staff! all around a great experience. it's hidden in a strip mall attached to a gas station. who on earth would think this would have been one of my favorite pizza joints in the country? the flavors were amazing. had the guido and zen garden. i loved them both. i'll defiantly be back. go try it, you'll love it."
211,4,Positive,"parents took me here while i was home for labor day. we walked right in on a saturday evening, no wait. place is nice and open inside, especially on a nice day with the patio open. 

we got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. i was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. i was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in sautéed onions, but wow were they good. seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in. tasted like a chicken wing should, not trying too hard to mask the actual taste. i wish i had taken a picture so you could see the onion pile, which we ate on the pita bread that came with it (my dad also added some to his pizza when it came.)

the pizza was also quite good. i loved the mushrooms because they were cooked differently than the normal soggy type that shows up on pizza. my only complaint, and i know it's coal oven pizza, is that the edge of our pizza crust was very burnt. the bottom wasn't, but the edge of about half was extremely blackened. i think it needed spun more in the oven while cooking to even it out. but i'd still definitely return, it was even good cold for breakfast leftovers the next day!"
212,5,Positive,"found out about dino's from a neighborhood post, went with my family for dinner, was not disappointed, food was delicious, had a caesar salad and a 16 inch pizza , the crust was amazinggggg, so crispy , not something i come across too often living in az.. the staff is super friendly, the only thing i will mention is that they are clearly still putting the finishing touches together on the look and presentation, and are not quite all set up, but they are only open for 3 weeks and they haven't had their official grand opening, but i will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone! i mean at the end of the day its the food and service that matters to me and they are a 10 in both!!!"
213,4,Positive,"stopped here for a quick bite before going to dinner. had a delicious slice of pizza with goat cheese, onions, eggplant and heirloom tomatoes. pleasant service also and the place was packed with patrons."
214,4,Positive,"tops is the oddball little neighbourhood dive bar/sports bar that i would be happy to call my local watering hole. 

cont'd below, but first off - as far as pizza goes, tops are total champions! super heavy yet not greasy, and loaded the hell up with tasty toppings, tops does pizza right. we got the new yorker half and halfed with the spartan pizza. steak bites, mushrooms, green pepper, onions and bacon stripes [sic] (actia;;u there were a tonne of spelling mistakes on this menu - @yycist would have a hayday) meets donair meat and banana peppers. it's unruly delicious. it's also close to $40 for an xl (14"").a worth it? yeah, we both had leftovers.

you start getting north and what happens? unfortunately the bars get further and further away. you'd better hope you live next to a fits-all bar that fits you. or, you know, you could just live a lifestyle that doesn't involve having a close to home spot where you can drink, eat, and befriend the other drinkin' eatin' locals... but i don't even want to entertain that as a possibility...

now i say sports bar/dive bar. on first look, tops is surprisingly nice, sporting a giant guitar in the roof. on the ground, the bar counters shadow the outline of the giant guitar. where the fretboard is, is a long bar height table good for conversational seating for up to 8 people. but for some reason i can't help but think that it is merely lipstick on a pig... maybe it was the human feces smeared along and adjacent strip mall glass door, and then piled on the sidewalk below, as i approached tops... maybe.

but tops can't be blamed for that, it wasn't even their business! well, yes it wasn't their business, but can they be blamed? ehn, i have a feeling that's a different story altogether... i don't yet know the denouement."
215,5,Positive,"sucks!!! totally sucks!!!! sucks that i can't change what i get regularly there. so good i get the same thing every time and some how taste better every time! will keep going back again and again.
every one needs to go here!
it's subway but with pizza. i'm getting hungry already and about to head over to custom built pizza...... yum!"
216,5,Positive,"my family and i tried this restaurant for a grad celebration, based on the great reviews on yelp and it sure delivered! our party of 4 ordered a few apps to share as well as 3 mains.
the highlights were the antipasto della casa, margherita pizza and agnolotti. i also need to mention how delicious the tiramisu was - and i'm a chocolate cake kinda girl!
service was also phenomenal - we can't wait to return!!"
217,4,Positive,"always searching for a lunch deal - that's me. luigi's may become my near west side place to go when i am out doing errands and crave some cheezy fresh pizza and a salad.
lunch special - any pizza at 6 inch size with any small salad for $8.99. that is a good deal when the pizza is truly handmade with fresh mozz.
i chose the housemade spicy sausage pizza and the arugula salad. crust was thin and perfect really. (fyi- i am super picky about pizza crust.) sausage was tasty.
 the salad was big for a small salad; it came with lots of caramelized onions, walnuts and fresh goat cheese.
while a 6 in. pizza would not satisfy my husband - for me it is exactly right for lunch.

service was very friendly and prompt even though the place was busy at noon with 80% tables full and one large kid party.

tables have paper covers and crayons- fun!

they were offering some fresh fruit sangrias - which sounded awesome - must go back and try those!"
218,4,Positive,"i am rating this for eat in only. the pizza was awesome!! the loaded fries not so much, it was a very small serving and just bland. we had plenty of drink refills and ate downstairs during a planned event. i gave it a 4 based on the fact that one menu item was great and the other not. i would like to try it again but skipping the fries."
219,5,Positive,"i was here with friends a few weeks back and i must say i was quite impressed by the pizza they serve. they have huge pizza on the display which is quite appetising. 

we ordered mushroom pizza and hot lips (i remember pineapple as one of the toppings). hot lips was quite an amusing name!! they give huge slices of pizza and one slice is like a small pizza you get at regular pizza joints. they are also generous with the toppings they give. one slice is totally worth the price!! i prefer adding extra chilli flakes to my pizza as it adds extra zing to the whole experience of eating a hot slice of pizza. for drinks, i recommend the red ribbon mintt ginger dirnk. anytime during the day in hot summer, it is my favorite drink. it also goes well with the pizza. 

i will go back again and if you are in southside with a bunch of friends or by yourself, you should consider visiting this place for a slice of the huge pizza they serve!!"
220,4,Positive,"my boyfriend and i were so excited for this restaurant to open because it's so close to his house! we have been here three different times and were happy each time. i suggest going on wednesdays for wing night! their wings are great! we also enjoyed the pizza, the crust is awesome. the meatballs and cuban sandwich were just okay...which is why i chose 4 stars rather than 5. they also have a great beer selection!"
221,5,Positive,"i came here after receiving a free pizza at a yelp event.  upper crust had some of the best food at the event so i couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  

my friend and i came here on a wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  i can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a shiraz and it was good.  we shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  it was all so delicious!  

i also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  again, it was very tasty!  

 everyone was very friendly and prompt.  i will be back to upper crust!"
222,5,Positive,"seriously, i feel like such a fool for not trying this place sooner. i disregarded it for some hipster spot having a moment, but i was wrong. a pizza place that has mastered crust, that reminds me so much of my favorite nyc spot in the west village. seriously, give this place a try."
223,4,Positive,"clean, nicely decorated pizza place. the margherita is simple and delicious. ingredients look fresh and the service is friendly. every time i go it's in the late afternoon so the place is pretty empty and the service is fast.  i would like to try the bruschetta... have only tried the pizza so far."
224,4,Positive,"i have to say, this may be my favorite wood fired pizza in central phoenix. 

i'll have to try spasso's pizza a few more times to confirm that my infatuation was not the result of a long week, my chemical composition on that particular day, or the peace of a cold beer, but if future experiences are anything like my first, i am a fan! 

the house made mozzarella appetizer is ok. the steak (that my boyfriend ate) was fine. the real star here is the pizza, which had a perfectly chewy crust and the meat combination completed a perfect blend of cheesy saltiness. 

the owner was a little overly chatty, but at the same time, how can i blame him when clearly this restaurant is his pet project. the service was great...i don't think our water glasses were ever empty. 

i have to admit, a small part of my enthusiasm is probably because this restaurant is in town & country mall, which is a terribly under appreciated piece of real estate...i'd love to see this good, family-owned restaurant survive."
