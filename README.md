# Synthetic_NLP_Data_Generation_Paper
This repo is a project where I am exploring using GPT-2 to generate NLP observations for classification models.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to explore the possibility of generating synthetic data to improve classification models.

The details of this project can be followed step-by-step in these two Jupyter Notebooks:
